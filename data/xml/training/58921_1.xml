They help us overcome obstacles that obscure our lives from the rest of the world like hearing loss. Although they go through tough training with the soon-to-be owner, the process eventually pays off as the owner benefits from the dog and the dog gets a real home to stay in. If you were had hearing loss and didn't have a hearing dog, you would probably be lost in the world and senseless beyond comprehension. To sum it all up, hearing dogs are lifesavers for people with hearing loss.]]>

Helping these women or men is a mission in there eyes. The human also takes part as I said beforethey have to take classes and get along with dog and see if there at a good home. Assiting dogs are a huge responsibility and they have even more massive responibility then most humans. Forsay, some eighteen year olds doont even have jobs but these dogs were probaly 5,6,7 or around that with driven persisures everyday. So before anybody has some thing to say then I think you should compare animals to some humans everyday life.

The dogs are going to have to take a person across the streets without getting ran over and they also have to watch out for people that are walking to not bump into them. Lastly when dogs that are highly trained and are told to do a job the dogs take it seriously. In the end guide dogs need to be good at hearing that way if the person needs to go somewhere the dog knows where to go. The guide dogs need to be good at understanding because what if the person tells the dog something and the dog doesent understand him then the dog is going to be lost and not know where to go.The person puts all of his trust on the dog and that nothing will happen and that they dont get lost and get into accidents.

Dogs can protect people because they can here noises and when someone is screaming.They have to be prepared for anything they have to be obienece but they can also be fun. Sometimes they bark if they dont know anybody. They can also attack but good dogs just bark and then they be quiet. Dogs do go into training maybe because they just dont know how to be good. Their owner also has to go because they might be doing something wrong to make their dog how they are. It's ok if you might have a bad dog but it can become a very good doog if you just train him or her. I think that dogs are very cute and nice and also very warm. If you play with them they can be a very nice dog but if you do something wrong they can also do something wrong. If I was you I would take my dog to the Dog Park or just a walk or even maybe just in your backyard.

Without Levi waking up the girl, the girl would've slept in and be late to work. It's good to have a dog because they can help you in so many ways. One way is they can protect you from something/someone dangerous. Second, they can alarm you from something coming or to wake you up to go to school/work and etc. Third, dogs are such a great company to have around! They're playful when you want to play with them. Another way their company is great is by just not being scared home alone. Secondly, dogs have very great hearing, seeing. Dog ears are so well for hearing, if something tiny falls they'll automatically hear it. A way dogs are good as seeing is very well too. Some examples are that if something/someone passes by quickly the dogs will see it in a bolt! Dogs just hear and see mostly everything.]]>

Without the dog, he or she won't know what is going on around them and could get seriously hurt from lack of hearing. This dog needs to be trained correctly or else the dog and the dog's owner could get hurt and die. But the owner must also be nice to the dog or else the dog won't trust the owner and the dog may not care whether or not the owner is hurt. The dog could hear a sound and not tell the owner because he couldn't care less. I believe that the dog is very crucial to a deaf person's survival. I believe the dog is important because it is very obidient, can take care of the owner of the dog, and can save someone's life. The hearing dog is very important for a deaf person's life.]]>

These dogs will help deaf people, blind people, and even regular people too. They help make sure wherever you go or wherever you are they make sure you're safe no matter what happens. This is a good thing, why you might ask, because deaf and blind people need help with a lot of things like, being able to see where you are going and hearing noises that might mean danger, seeing stop signs, hearing firetrucks to be aware, and even when someone is trying to talk to you, and if you want to help somebody with anything to see.That is why I think you should get a hearing-eye dog. But not only do I think you should get one, I know you shoul get one.]]>

They would be in danger if they went into a busy street, because they couldn't hear any cars coming. If there was a fire, they wouldn't hear the alarms. Hearing dogs act as a person's ears, and humans rely on sound to live a good life. Dogs also act as companions to people, so they won't get lonely. What would we do without hearing dogs?]]>

It's sort of like having another person living with you to help you do things you aren't eligible to do yourself. Assistance dogs are great to have when you have a disability such as being blind or deaf because you can't do everything on your own. Like if you're blind for example, you'd need an assistance dog to help you walk around town or to help you if there's a car coming towards you or like if the light is green and it's your turn to cross the street, and if your disability is being deaf, then you wouldn't be able to hear ambulence sirens or firetruck sirens or any kind or sirens, and you wouldn't know if a car was honking at you or if you got a text message, or, like they used in the story, if your alarm clock was going off. Assistance dogs are good to have and all though they may not be very useful to people that don't have disability's, they're useful to people that do have a disability. So if you know anybody that's blind, or deaf, or that you think would be better if they had an assistance dog, you should recommend them to get one.]]>

Some deaf people have hearing-aids, but as for Sue, she was asleep unaware of what was happening. Having her assistance dog, Levi, wake her up. For blind people, isn't as hard. The dog would lead them on to whatever they need to go, bark when they hear danger, alerting their walker. Without assitance dogs, I think th9ings would be a lot harder for people that are deaf or blind.]]>

Like the dog will tell sue what she cant hear like a phone ringing or a doorbell even when a microwave buzzer goes off things like that. For example a baby crying for a deaf person's help i would say the dog will alarm sue so she will know . But before that happens and they officialy say that this dog is going to be an assistant dog for the deaf or the blind. They need to go threw training like obedience,must respond to sounds within 15 seconds the dog needs to go in training programs and that is what they will learn this is all found in paragraph 3 .]]>

I suggest dogs and owners should go into hearing classes, exspeically if they can't hear as well as they used to. I come from personal experience because I once saw in New York a hearing dog save a person's life. Even if you know someone who needs a hearing dog, I surely suggest you talk to them about investing in one. It may just save there own life. If you need one I say &quot; go for it &quot; you may not need it, but one day you never know because one hearing dog might just save your life. Make sure if you do want one to get a reliable person to teach your dog, and make sure you also take classes as well. If you dont want a hearing dog, that is fine you may also invest in many other things as well. But by any chance you get one, just remember to keep your eye on the road, your dog, and mostly your safety.]]>

They have the very important job of caring for a person who is deaf. If the dog doesn't perform their job 100% correct, the person may die. In this article, I showed you that the dogs must respond to basic obedience commands 90% of the time and must respond to sounds within 15 seconds. That is a pretty tall order! The dogs must also alert their owners by using physical contact, such as jumping on the bed to alert an owner of an alarm clock, or leading the person to the source of the sound. If we did not have service dogs, especially hearing dogs, many deaf and blind people would die or be seriously injured when doing simple tasks. We should be thankful for our service dogs for all of their dedication and time to help humans. After all, a dog is man's best friend!]]>

Hearing dogs make a deaf person's life much easier because they inform their owner of the noises in their surroundings.

Studies by the American Assosiation for the Well Being of the Deaf have shown that someone with a hearing ear dog is more aware of their surroundings, and are more productive in society. If Sue Thomas had not had her heating ear dog, she would have not been able to wake up from a normal alarm clock, and would have had much more trouble waking up in the morning.

And if any blind or deaf person doesn't have a earing or seeing dog they have a very good chance of hurting themsleves from their surroundings and might have a posability of dieing.

They go to training to help the blinds if there are emergencies or to even walk. They are suppose to be obedient to there commanders at all times. The people who are blind who needs the hearing dog also has to go to training to see if they can take care and properly treat them. If a blind wants to take a walk or something they could use the hearing dog to guide them and take care of them. The Hearing Dogs is a big saver for the blind. Let's say a lady was blind and he is sitting in her house and an alarm goes off. The hearing dog would guide them to safety. These incredible dogs is also a big help to the deaf too. If a door bell goes off or a alarm goes off the dogs could aware them and they could go to safety. That is why the her=aring dogs is a good help for everyone.]]>

If your Hearing-Ear dog doesnt respond to a sound within 15 seconds you might get hurt depending on what is making the sound and also if they dont respond to basic obedience commands 90% of the time then you might also get seriously hurt. So now is the time to think, do you think Hearing-Ear dogs help the community and people with hearing disorders, or do you think they are just a waist of dogs and money to use for people who can just get someone to help them....now is the time to decide....Hearing-Ear dogs or Help from a friend?]]>

It has an amazing nose which can track things there looking for like with german sheperds. The cops use them to find drugs like cocaine and marijuana that is illegal in some states. They also use them to find bombs or c4 that terrorists would have. Even guns somehow! The dog also has one of the fastest speeds in the world, faster than humans and faster than most animals. They can run at speeds higher than you can think. Faster than a car shockingly! The dog also has it senses.there eyes can see distances that we cannot. There noses (like I said earlier) are amazing. There there hearing capability is so srong it can go past what we can hear that we can't even hear it, but they can. There stomach is so strong they can eat anything. Even chocolate! And there feeling is both in there hearts because dogs are mostly always happy and there paws. They have really strong legs and arms because they always got to walk on them everyday and if we step on rocks it hurts barefoot. When they do it they don't care. They are the est of the animals. So now we have learned dogs are not only strong, and helpful. But they are one of our favorite and most domesticated friends. Dogs have always been our friends sence they came here. They love attention, they're fun to play with and they do stupid stuff that makes us laugh. They are a man's best friend!]]>

Such as lifting a paw to person signaling to shake hands. Also in need to wake up or being on time the hearing dog will leap into your bed or pounce on you to get your attention. Another way they are helpful as explained the dog would make physical contact if he/she heard car honking and other trafic noises. At home they would alert you imediately if they heard common household items: phone,doorbell,microwave,smoke alarm or a babies cry. I pick this as a conclusion because it defines why i feel that hearing dogs are good affective help for deaf and blind people to live life like a regular human.]]>

These dogs are trained very well to help their deaf or blind owner do something as simple as waking up in the morning, to getting their owner out of their house when there is a fire in their home. Deaf people and blind people who are thinking about getting an assistance dog may be worried about if the dog forgets to help them in a fire or if the dog wouldn't respond fast enough. Well, while the dog gets trained to become a hearing dog, they are trained to respond to a sound within 15 seconds. That's enough time to save a life.]]>

You would have to train to act calm in public and teach them to react to certain sounds. Then, after they have been trained, they must take a test. If they do not pass the test, you have a chance to adopt that dog. If they do pass, then you will know that you have helped a person in need. You see, not everyone is blessed with perfect hearing- some can't hear at all. Those people need help, and hearing dogs can help them. A member of your own family might even have one. So, dont think of those unfortunate ones as inferior- help them! Sign up to train a dog, and you will help one who may not be as lucky as you!]]>

But without this helping animal it will be very difficult to maintane this everyday routine. With Levi's dog it helps her immesly in many occasions. Without this dog is is a difficult process to get up, eat, go out, and just have fun. So when Levi went through training she obviously passed, but it was not that easy. They would have to go throught the everyday process of living. If the dog is fed on times, clean up is good, taken care of well? All that type of stuff is very major in this test. Imagine living like that. Waking up to the pitter patter of your dog. Your dog helping you live a life. It may be difficult because you cant hear but it sure does keep everything in order. So I honestly believe that owning this furry little friend helps to the impossible when you can't hear. Even if sometimes it is difficult.]]>

The hearing dogs can assit you in waking up in the morning just like &quot;Sue Thomas&quot;. They can also help the person that needs assistance by helping them hear traffic noises. For example horns of a car and/or sirens too. They also could save a life or two of a person by alerting the person that the smoke alarm is going off in they're house. People love these dogs and think they help so much they made a television show about them. they can also just assit you in your daily life by letting the person know that the microwave is done and they can let them know if they're baby is crying. they will be able to keep them out of harms way. They will pretty much let them eat too. They are also able to help their person's young if they need it and they dont hear them. I know you've heard of seeing dogs but know you can say you heard of hearing and seeing dogs for people.]]>

People who are deaf also get alot of training so the trainers make sure that they are going to give the dog the attention and affection that the dog(s) needs. The many people who rely on dogs to help them with their daily routines need the dogs to be utterly focused on the task at hand and not be distracted at any cost what so ever. Some examples of things that would uually disdract a dog that the trainers use to get the dog to stay focused and not get distracted are; squirrels, cats, frisbees, etc. Many of the dogs do stay focused but those who don't would still need a little bit more training so they would take them back and replace them until they are completely focused.]]>

Also known as a hearing-ear dog, they alert the deaf about the sounds around them, as an example, a baby crying, the sound of a car horn while crossing the street, or even the sound of a microwave beeping. The dogs could also be trained to make physical contact along with the dog leading their owners to the area. Then when you get a hearing dog, the person receiving the dog must also go through training to see if they are fit enough to take care of that animal. Also the dogs in training programs have to meet high standards, the dog must respond to basic obedience commands, 90% of the time they need to respond to sounds within 15 seconds, and they need to know how to alert someone so they understand the dog.]]>

The dog must maintain a sharp ear and alert the owner whenever a noise is heard, such as a doorbell or a telephone ringing. At first the owner might be cofused, but after a while they willl get used to a dog showing them the object that made the sound. The dog might also make mistakes occasionally. This is to be expected of anything, as everyone makes mistakes. Everyday hearing dogs help many deaf people live their lives.]]>

Even when the dogs do things that aren't physical, like lifting a paw to the person, it's just as helpful as a more physical approach. A hearing dog's job is very important, and it has to go through lots of training to keep its owner safe. If you're deaf, a hearing-ear dog just might save your life.]]>

They learn how to lay down when enemys are close to them, but I got told whhen you command the cop dog it is always better to give it simple words. Words like search, down, sit, and you can also say attack. They are trained to be like human cops almost, but they can be really dangerous. When they get told to attack you better get away from the dog. Or your history, the only dogs i'v been told that could take on a cop dog is a Alaskian grey wolf.

Sue continues to snooze, unaware of the noise. Her dog, Levi, hears the sound and leaps on Sue's bed. Alerting her that in fact it is time to get ready for work. Hearing dogs are in the category of &quot;assistance dogs&quot;. They are similar to the traditional seeing-eye dogs that help the blind, &quot;hearing-eat&quot; dogs. These dogs help people who are deaf to become aware of the sounds in their enviroment by alerting them to common household sounds such as a phone or doorbell, microwave buzzing, smoke alarm going off, or a baby crying. Dogs can help deaf people in public, noticing sounds such as honking horns and other traffic noises. A hearing dog is trained to make physical contact when it hears a sound and then lead the person to the source, Often dos will lift a paw to the person, as if ready to shake hands. Other times it will be a bit more physical, like Levi leaping onto the bed. In public, the dog will turn to the source of the sound, alerting the person to different things such as vehicles, sirens, or other noise. Dogs in training programs have to meet a high standards. They must respond to basic obedience commands 90% of the time and must respond to the sounds within 15 seconds. The person receiving the dog must also go through training, proving him or her can work with the dog and properly take care of the dog.]]>

For example a deaf person is waling across the street when a firetruck comes by, the dog nudges the deaf person away from the street and then the person would not be injured. They give the person signals such as nudging, pointing, and climbing. Hearing dogs can help you out when your in bed and your alarm clock goes off and you cannot hear it, they'll come and wake you up. Hearing dogs have to go through a lot of training usually starting when their puppies, or being adopted from a shelter. Not only do the dogs have to train but so do the humans to see if their not only capable of taking care of a dog, but to see which dog is compatible for them. It takes true love and talent to train one of those dogs but in the long run the will give their future family safety and lots of love.]]>

The specialized dogs help alert their deaf owners when an alarm is going off, when the phone rings, and even when simpler sounds are made, such as when the microwave buzzes or a doorbell rings. &quot;Hearing-ear&quot; dogs can save people's lives and have met high standards to do so, such as responding to sounds within 15 seconds, responding to obedience commands 90% of the time, and must be checked for respecting their prospective owners. Specialized dogs can make a difference to those with the hard of hearing and make life a little bit simpler for them.]]>

Being deaf is probably very hard, not being able to hear anything. The dogs alert its owner of alarming, scary sounds or even a simple, soothing sound. They're able to let you know when someone is trying to get ahold of you, when the telephone rings, or even if a car is coming your way, blaring its horn at you, your just not able to hear. Another reason I think the dogs are great additions, is because being deaf will most likely be very lonely. You would never be able to have a full conversation with anyone, but if you have a hearing dog, you'll always know they're listening. Dogs make excelent friends and I think every deaf person should have a hearing dog.]]>

They help eachother out, the owner feeds the pet while the pet assists the owner in thir every day life. They assist the blind by being their eyes. They pull them one way or bark to tell them to stop. Dogs help many people even without them knowing. Sometimes they do stuff apart from the owner to help the owner in later days. Like if the dog picks up stuff in it's mouth and drops it into a pile so you won't step in it, it also helps with picking it up since it is in one pile. Since deaf people can't hear their alarms or hear anything the dog helps them. The dog helps in traffic by pulling them a certain way. Or it helps with pulling them a certain way while they wait for it to go off. Many people rely on their dogs and many dogs rely on their owners. It is like you help me I help you.]]>

According to my passage hearing dogs are extremely important and without them deaf people might not be able to do well in this world. So we thank them.

These dogs are sometimes referred to as &quot; hearing-ear&quot;. THese dogs help people who are deaf to become aware of sounds in their environment by alerting them to common household sounds such as a phone or doorbell ring, a microwave buzzer, a smoke alarm going off, or a baby's cry. These dogs also help their owners in public, noticing sounds such as honking horns and other traffic noises. Often the dog will lift it's paw to the person, as if already to shake hands. A hearing dog is trained to make physical contact when it hears a sound and then lead the person to the source. Other times the dog will be more physical, like Levi leap into bed. Dogs in training programs have to meet high standards. They must respond to basic obedience commands 90% of the time and must respond to sounds within 15 seconds. The person receiving the dog must also go through training, providing he or she can work with the dog and properly take care of it.]]>

They help people who are deaf get out of bed at the right time, and keep the person aware of things like a doorbell,honking or a microave buzzer. I think that these dogs are a very amazing help to all people who have a hearing disability. What would you do if you couldn't hear?]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[once upon a time there was a random person named billy. one day billy forgot how to breath so then he went to the hospital. once he got to the hospital the docter said there was nothing he could do besides pumping air into his own lungs, billy thought this would be to hard so he took the air bag and started searching. billy started searching for anything that could make him able to breath again. he came across a mad scientest and the scientest said he could turn him into a sea animal. of course billy said yes immediatly and so the experiment began. little did they know a alien attack was coming to the planet earth. right when the mad scientest was about to turn him into a sea animal with his ray gun the aliens attacked and they hit the ray gun. the ray gun spun out of control and accidentaly hit a satelite and that satelite reflected it and then turned everybody on earth into a sea animals. the aliens' guns were actually water cannons also so that caused the earth to fill up with water and become a water planet. but luckily because of all the other gadgets in the mad scientest's labratory some side affects were put on billy and the scientest. and they became the super underwater crime fighting team known as mermaid man (mad scientest) and barnacle boy (billy)! but there was also some bad side affects done to the other living being in the lab. the dirty bubble and ray man were created. they were the worst super villians on earth. once earth was covered in water and people were sea animals everyone swam to america where they made a new city called bikini bottem. bikini bottem was the only civilization out there an there was only a population of 1600 fish/people. the rest of the world had died from the alien attack. one of the last remaining humans was on a space mission to the moon and when he came back he got sucked underwater. luckily there was a old dieing crab swimming by the old crab gave the human his shell and the human was able to breath underwater. &quot;what is your name so i can thank you&quot; the human said &quot;my name is krusty&quot; responded the crab. the man changed his name to krusty to honor the crab even though his real name was eugene. once krusty arrived at the bottem of the ocean he found the bikini bottem and there he found his daughter, pearl who had turned into a whale. sadly his wife didnt make it after the alien attack. since no one was using their human name anymore eugene changed his last name to crabs. since eugene didnt have a job anymore he had to find a new way to make money. that night he was making burgers for his daughter when she said &quot;these are really good you should sell these or something&quot; at that moment eugene knew what he was going to do. he went to the bank and got a loan for $5,000 so he could build a building. after 2 long months of construction the krusty krab was finally open. but he needed employees of course, so he went door to door asking if anyone needed a job and surprisingly the first to people needed a job so he hired a fry cook named spongebob and a cashier named squidward. for the first week and a half they didnt have any customers, so eugene decided to go to resturante college. there he met a plankton, named plankton. and he still had money problems and was in debt to the bank. so this was his last chance. at resturante school with plankton they were experimenting with eugene's previous recipe. and then eugene added one ingredient that made the buger amazing. since eugene was a very selfish person/crab he kept the ingredient a secret and quit resturaunt school. plankton was very mad about this and vowed that he would try to steal the secret formula untill the day he died. once eugene got back to the krusty krab he shared the recipe with spogebob and he fell in love with it. spongebob suggested that the call the burger a krabby patty and so they did. but the krusty krab still wasnt getting customers so eugene had to try something new, he had to try something exciting, so he raised the prices to $2.99 for each krabby patty. surprisingly this worked. they stared getting more and more customers and then finally eugene payed off his debt to the bank. after that they kept getting more popular and this made plankton mad so he decided to open a resturaunt across the street called the chum bucket, and there he served chum which was another experiment done with eugene. the chum was almost poisen so of course he never got a customer. so in planktons fre time he tried stealing the krabby patty formula but he never could because he was so small. so then after a long time he started to go crazy and he became evil. he started coming up with crazy ideas and contraptions. in his resturaunt he made a labratory and made a computer wife named karen for himself. she helped him with his evil plans and contraptions. and so it continued that plankton kept on trying to steal the krabby patty formula.]]>

Without the hearing dogs, deaf people would not be able to pay attention to the sounds. The ability to hear is important because it is one of our 5 essential senses that guide our lives. Since deaf people lack the ability to hear, they need the hearing dogs, which eventually will be part of their lives as their ears. Deaf people have to appreciate those dogs and take care of them. Those dogs dedicated their lives to help the deaf people, so they cannot fall back behind in the society. In other perspective, the dogs should be obedient to their deaf owners. The key to forming a good relationship or bond is the appreciation and care for each other.

For example, ??These dogs help people who are deaf to become aware of sounds in their environment by alerting them to common household sounds such as a phone or doorbell ring, a microwave buzzer, a smoke alarm going off, or a baby??s cry??. Another thing that shows how these dogs are there for the humans and are important to their everday routines is,??A hearing dog is trained to make physical contact when it hears a sound and then lead the person to the source]]>

They are very repsonsible and helpful.

When ever someone needs to go to work their dog barks but if they don't wake up the dogs will jump on their bed and wake them up that way. Whenever someone that can't hear out in public their dog points to where the noises are coming from. When people try too get a hearing dog they have to go through training, the companies that give them away make them go through training because they want to see if the person can take care of their hearing dog.]]>

Most of the hearing dogs are Labadore Retrievers which are great dogs who love people. I have a Chocolate Lab and she is very friendly but she is also protective. But, the thing about Labadore Retrievers is that they are hyper and they love to run. They aslo love attention,do tricks,and eat food.]]>

The only reason they pick dogs for that is because dogs alert you if sirens go off, or crying babies, a microwave buzzer, a smoke alarm, so you feel alarmed and ready to get out of the situation. People give dogs special training to do that. they help with one sence that you lose. they help with only that sence because when one sence goes out the other sences get stronger and better.]]>
