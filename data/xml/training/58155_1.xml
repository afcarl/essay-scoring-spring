Really cheerleading is a real sport in my opinion because in cheerleading is exercises and having strength to throw people up in the in the air and catch them again.Cheerleading is all about '' routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building.''The other evidence is cheerleading is not about cheerleading for a football team or basketball team it's about competing another team and and cheerleading is mainly about is skilled of a gymnast and having strength. 2. ''Cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898; members of the ''pep club''.'' Even George B. Bush was in cheerleading in Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and he was the head cheerleader.

The boys and girls who cheer must have the strength of a football player.&quot; In order to have as much strength as a football player we have to train everyday if we are truley determined to be our absolute best. We need to be strong to do a toe-touch because it involves jumping as high as we can using the strength in our legs. Cheerleaders also have to be stong to do a stunt and to lift their flyers high without loosing their balance to keep the flyer up as long as they can. Without strength, cheerleaders wouldn't be able to do the unbelievable things they do. Cheerleading and gymnastics are very similar, except the fact that gymnastics is cinsidered a real sport. According to American Acadamy of Pediatrics, cheerleading involves just as much flexibility and strength as gymastics. For example, in order to do tumbling and the splits, the athelete has to be flexable and use upper-body strength, just like gymnists. Gymnists use strength to pull themselves up on the pole, just like cheerleaders use strength to do a stunt. If gymnastics has the privlage to be considered a real sport, why can't cheerleading? &quot;Sport&quot; is just another word for competing. Title IX regulations state, &quot;... a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal is to compete.&quot; Cheerleading requires all of that, but it also requires courage, determination, and spirit.]]>

Another thing is that they have to be mentelly strong to support all there waight from there team members. Also they dont just cheer for there school they compete with other schools. Like who danced the best or did the better tricks. I think this is why people should just count it as a sport,because of all the the mucles you need to build in your body and the coditoning cheerleaders need to do. So why not count it as a sport if they need to get strong. Now this is why i think cheerleading should be counted as a sport.]]>

They have to be flawless when they preform and cant just avoid not doing the stunt. Some people dont understand how hard it auctually is. Cheerleaders have to be strong, light on their feet, flexable, and be loud in the right situations. Having to throw a teammate up in the air and then having to catch her all in one motion takes muscle, coordination and teamwork. Seeing how much they train is like watching the same channel on tv every night, its consistant as in doin the same thing until they execute it. You know what they say pratice makes perfect. The whole team has to work together to show just how hard cheer is. Even though cheer is a girl domanant sport men can cheer too! Former president George w. Bush cheered for his highschool, Phillips Academy. Cheer was invented by a male so it should not be wrong for a male to be on a cheer team. Its no diffrent than cheering on your teammate on any other sports team. Cheering has more organization and pizazz than any other sport in highschool. People who say cheer is not a real sport should try it for themselves and then judge if its a sport or not.]]>

One of the most demanded reqierments is their physical strenght needed to hold and throw one another to preform daring stunts. The second requierment needed of a cheer leader is how flexable they need to be to perform certain moves or cheers. A third demanded physical need is how much endurence they need.

But there is so much more that that.They must train for a long time and that means lots of running! Most people doing competitive cheering which requires lots of upper body strength to lift people up for pyramids. Many cheerleaders would get very defensive if you were to tell them that cheerleading wasn't a sport. So if you did that, I would feel sorry for you. In my opinoin cheerleading is a sport. It requires everything, if not more of all the other sports. You have to have emotianal as well as physical strength. Title IX regulations states that a sport must be open to both men and women, coaches, practices, comepetitions during a season, and a governing organization. Cheerleading meets all of these regulations, so I don't see why peple say that it is not a sport.]]>

The definition of athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; which means being a member of a cheerleading team you need to be qualified as an athlete.

Cheerleading has evolved from just cheering to a physically demanding sport. Cheerleading takes time and effort to improve upon. Nowadays, it's not just yelling and waving, it's tricks and impressive gymnastic stunts! Not very many people can hold several girls on their shoulders, or flip through the air like a cheerleader can. There are competitions for cheerleading teams, which are extremely competitive, which proves that it is, in fact, a sport. Cheerleading requires a combination of strength, agility, and effortlessness. Cheerleaders are athletes. Cheerleading isn't just for girls, despite many opinions! Boys and girls join cheer teams and compete everywhere. Male and female cheerleaders are very limber, and extremely strong. Cheer was originally created by men attending the University of Minnesota. Even one of our great presidents, President George W Bush, was respected as head cheerleader in his day at Phillips Academy in Massachusetts. Not only is cheerleading fun, but it requires many students, male and female, to become involved at their schools. Sports bring people everywhere together, and that is what cheerleading is all about.]]>

Cheerleaders showed count as a sport because its smiler to gymnastics. Even though its a dangerous sport but also football is too. So why cant cheerleading be the same. Plus cheerleading gives girls people that have the same interest in sports or they are just wanna be popular. Plus its true football players are able to lift there team why shouldnt cheerleaders do the same. Also even if a girl trys out, then next time they know what to practice more often. Also cheerleaders could go and compete with other cheerleaders and win trophies or medals. If football, soccar, volleyball, and other sports get to be awarded for their athletics so can cheerleaders. Dance students cant do complex stuff like cheerleaders because they dont have trust like cheerleaders. But cheerleaders can do those stunts because they have trust in the squad. Trust is in every sport especially football they will beat eachother up but cheerleaders talk it out or compete to see who win. Thats why cheerleading should be a sport at school also they will have more qualities theen others.]]>

She said that George Bush was the head cheerleaderof Phillips Academey. She also claimed that she interviewed and looked up facts about cheerleading.

It was first invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898. They even elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crowd during the football team's last game of the season, that's another reason that cheerleading should be defined as a true sport. One more reason that it should be considered a real sport is because even a former president of the United States of America was the head cheerleadr of his squad. For something to be a sport, the main goal is to compete. Title IX regulations require universities to offer equal athletic opportunities to both men and women; under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization, and its main goal must be to compete, and cheerleading is all of those things. You have practices every week, you have coaches, even if they are women who are coaching you, and they have a governing organization like a school to compete and, of course, you will hav competitions during a defined season or whole school year because cheerleading is a year round activity.]]>

Over many years when the first term &quot;cheerleading&quot; was invented by male states at the University of Minnesota in 1898, cheerleading has become a competitive sport. Cheerleading is not all about cheering for the football or basketball team. It requires &quot;fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tubling, and complex stunts.&quot; as well as being a physically demanding sport. In order to be a cheerleader one must train or be skilled in the sport which is also the defintion of being an &quot;athlete&quot;. The American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries and say &quot;Cheerleading should be disgnated a sport&quot; as the injuries are similar to other sport injuries. Many think that cheerleading is not a thing that should be taken seriously. They picture people shaking pompoms and yelling some words. They do not understand that cheerleaders can get injuried as their rountines are very complex. Some think that cheerleading cannot be a sport as it doesn't have rules. That is an easy solution as the government can set the rules easily. Under the &quot;Title IX regulations&quot; a sport must have coaches, organization, and clear defined rules before being considered a sport. Cheerleaders are very well organizated and have coaches.]]>

Quinnipiac University case, the court ruled that cheerleading doesn't have enough organization or set rules to be considered a sport, but that's it.

In cheerleading, you do not use any type of ball, only your own bodily movement. As stated by a director of a cheerleading program, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about ... it's about competing.&quot; This statement alone concludes the fact that Cheerleading is not a sport, because in sports such as Football and Soccer, you do not only compete.

In the dictionary, an athlete is &quot; a person who is trained or skiled in excercises, sports, or games requiring physicl strength, agility, or stamina. These characteristics follow those of a cheerleader. Cheerleaders get injuries like other sports too. In an American Academy of Pediatrics cheerleading report, it tells over the years cheerleading has become an activity that has complex stunts and fast-paced movements. It also says cheerleading shoud be a real sport so that its standards are met by governing bodies. It's obvious that at least someone has gotten hurt being a cheerleader. With that, it should be considered a sport because regular sports get injuries all of the time whether it's major or minor. The reason for sports is to have fun, learn discipline, and compete. A sport also needs to have a coach, practices, and an organization. Cheerleading is more than standing on a side-line and cheering now. Cheerleading is intense and is now competed nation-wide between different groups and schools. In cheerleading, the athletes learn discipline from their coaches. There are also scheduled practices in a season for the members of it. There is an organization for cheerleading to which sponsers competitions and events, school camps for cheer, and youth groups. Therefore, it is considered a sport.]]>

Cheerleaders have a season three times as long as all the other high school and middle school sports, in that time we train for not only rallying up crowds and performing dances, but also to defeat other teams in competitiion. The routines for a competition are very complex and include jumps, varying stunts and pyramids, dancing, and high level gymnastic-style tumbling. American Academy of Pediatrics reported about cheerleading injuries, stating that cheerleading should be a sport so it will have rules and regulations made by sports governing bodies and school athletic department. Cheerleading is already a very hazardous sport, but if there were no rules to follow, it would be far too chaotic and dangerous to perform even the simplest of stunts. Unlike other sports which only involve throwing, catching, running, etc. with a small one pound or less ball in hand cheer involves holding other athletes in the air, tossing them up and catching them which is already highly dangerous but without supervision by a qualified coach would have far too many injuries to be allowed in school.]]>

A cheerleader fits that definition. Cheerleaders are trained in exercises requiring physical streght, agility, and stamina.

Here is why cheerleaders are athletes. Next, cheerleaders get injured during thier routines like other athletes get injured in thier sport. According to the American Academy of Pediattrics, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subect to rules and regulations set forth by sport governing bodies&quot;. That is sayind that cheerleaders get injured jiust like other athletes. If cheerleaders and football players both get injured in thier sport, then are the both sports? If you say no, Then you are saying that cheerleading is not a sport, but the cheerleaders have to be as strong and agile as the football players.

The American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries saya &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has envolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines. also there is club vollyball, basketball, football, scocer, .etc. there is also club cheer, like ice all stars, cheer nation, and more. I can also see why peope would say chherleading is not a sport because some times they gust stand there and cheer on the players. at Biediger v. Quinnipiac University the US court of appeals for the second circuit, cheerleading needed to be a better sport. in concluthon i think that cheerleading should be a sport because if we have to be strong like foottball players to lift outher girls, or have stanama like track people so we can run and do trickes, and have skilles like gimnastics so we can do flips and outher things, and all of those things are sports thean cheerleading should be a sport to.]]>

A cheerleader has to be trained and skilled to do these kinds of tricks. I believe cheerleading is a sport because you are active, skilled, and you do a lot more work than normal high school sports like softball or basketball. Yes, other sports have different skills and abilites, but cheerleading takes more time and effort. I'm not saying other sports don't do anything and they don't take time or effort, but cheerleading has more skills and a lot more energy. Cheerleading should not have specific tasks to fill out because this is cheerleading not a high school sports team. Cheerleading does have a coach to do specific skills and practice time so everyone is not flaking out. Some cheer teams do have competitions other than a high school cheer team. Not all cheer teams just stand there and shake pompoms. You would be surprised about what kinds of things cheerleaders do. Maybe cheerleader think basketball players just show up to a game and shoot hoops. We all have different ideas about what different sports do. We shouldn't be juding on other sports.]]>

I believe it is, cheerleading requires many things from a person. Abilities, time and hard work all make up for one to do cheerleading. After all, you have to do that with sports too. Cheerleading has been around for a while now and many factors go into what you are able to do, not just yelling and playing with pompoms. Many have to be able to lift others up, have the abilities of a gymnast and also dance well. Also title IX states that a sport must have a coach, practices, competition, a governing organization, and a main goal. Even President George W. Bush was a head cheerleader. Cheerleading is not all fun and games but something people have to commit to and want to do.]]>

In the dictionary, its say that an althete is a person who is trained or skilled in exersises, sports, or games requiring phyisical strengh, aglitliy, or stamina. Cheerleading has to do with all of the above. In an addition to this, cheerleading has changed into a competitive, physically demanding, activity with leaps, tumbling, and stunts. For example, some stunts are making a human pyramid and tossing athletes into the air. Second of all, it is possible that cheerleading is not a sport. In the 2012 district court case, it was ruled that cheerleading was not a sport according to Title IX regulations. It said that cheerleading needed better organization. The Title IX regulations stated that it requires universities to offer equal athletic oppurtunities to both men and women. It also states that a sport must have coaches, practices, and competitions. Last, but not least, cheerleading has a wide variety of history and intersting facts. A famous cherleader was the former president, George W. Bush. He served as the head cheerleader in Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts during his senior year. Did you know that cheerleading was actually invented by a male student? Cheerleading were meant for pep clubs who elected yell leaders to engage he crowd in football games.

It's not like if everybody that does cheerleading doesn't believe that cheerleading is not a sport. Most of them think it is an intense sport and take it very seriously. For example, he has seachered up the word &quot;athlete&quot; and this is how they define it,&quot;a person who has trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; So if cheerleader do most of those things almost everyday, they must be considered a sport. Futhermore, there is more evidence to show that this is a actually a sport. For instance, there have been Ntaional cheerleading organizations for competitions and championships that happen everywhere. There are even cheer camps for high school students. There are also famous people who were also cheerleaders. One person for example was none other then the man himself, George W. Bush. He used to be the head cheerleader at Phillips Academy in Minnesota back in 1898. He used to cheer loadly during the game to make the players who were playing that game feel like they were the winners and nobody could beat them. You might not have thought of it before, but, girls and boys fight over the spot light when leading the cheer during the game. For them it is about competing and grace. So overall, cheerleading can be considered a sport for people and the students gives plenty of evidence to show and prove that 100% cheerleading is a sport.]]>

They have the same requirements as everyday sports. Cheerleaders put as much time and effort as regular highschool sports. Under Title IX, &quot;A sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing orginization.&quot; Cheerleading has a coach and a team leader who also serves as a coach. Practices are one of the main things in cheerleading. They must keep doing their routine over and over again until they get it perfect. There are many competitions set up for cheerleading. National cheerleading Orginization sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events. Many cheer squads go into competitions to win a trophy just like sports such as football, soccer, baseball, ect. Cheerleading meets all the requirements of what makes a sport a sport.]]>

In 2012, at the US Court os Appeals for the Second Curcuit, a decision was handed down that &quot; cheerleading nedded better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered as a sport.&quot; I am here to argue that cheerleading is a sport as much football, surfing, soccer, etc. In cheerleading, cheerleaders are required to &quot;have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; It's more than just waving pompoms and yelling cheers. It was in 1898 when cheerleading was invented by male students during a football game at the University of Minnesota. In a report done by the American Academy of Pediatrics about cheerleading injuries states that &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leapes and jumps, gymnastic-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; They also state that &quot; Cheerleading should be a designated sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; There were many famous people that took part in cheerleading during their school years, one of them being the former president, George W. Bush. He &quot;served as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachussetts, during his senior year of high school.&quot;]]>

These cheerleaders have to do complex and physically demanding routines with stunts such as a human pyramid. Also, the definition of athlete, acording to a source, is a person trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. That doesn't exactly cover this topic, though. For example, in baseball you have the world series, in football you have the superbowl, but in cheerleading, you have competitions. For instance, the National Cheerleading Organizationis sponsoring the upcoming reigonal and national competition and championship events. This would be the equivalent to the World Series, or The Super Bowl. There are even websites about cheerleading. There is one in specific called The National Cheer Organization that says that &quot;cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898; members of the 'pep club' elcted 'yell learders' to engage the crowd during the football team's last game of the season.&quot;]]>

Like he said you have to be as strong as any other athlete or as flexible as any gymnast. The defenition of athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. A cheerleader is obviously trained in games, spotrs, etc. which require strength and that's the exact defenition of what a athlete is, so all the fuss about 'is cheerleading a sport&quot; can all be done with if ypu just read the defentition of what an athlete is. Sure, a lot of people still may not think cheerleading is a sport. But footlball put there lives in danger everytime they play. Same with anytime of boxing. But think of this being dropped head first from 15 feet up. Even though cheerleading may sound like a ''girly' sport, it still is one.]]>

They also proved that they had to be strong enough to carry the cheer leaders on their backs. They proved that an academy also agrees that cheerleading should be a sport.

Title IX regulations require universitys to give equal opportunities to both men and women and that a sport must have coaches; Cheerleading has coaches and both genders may attend or excel at the task. Cheerleading may not be considered a sport by people because they label it as a &quot;girlie&quot; task but there are many people who oppose it such as the National Cheerleading Organization, they sponsor regional and national competitions and championship events. There are also many famous cheerleaders such as former president George W. Bush, he served as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover.

Dance is not considered a sport in the state of California and it is outragous. In fact, you are not allowed to get out of PE for being in dance or cheer. I would like to say dance and cheer is as much of a sport as any other sport. If you try to take a dance class, I can garantee it is a hard and sweaty as running. An athelete is defined as a person who is trained or skilled in exercise, sports, or games requiring physical strenghth, ability, or stamina. Chearleading and dance requires an extreme amount of skill, strength and stamana. In soccer one is required to run for stamana. Well in cheerleading and dance, you are required to do fast-paced rountines (sometimes more then five minuites) that includes jumps and leaps. One doesn't even do that much in soccer. In soccer you can take short little breaks in between getting the ball, however in dance and cheerleading taking a small break is not an option.]]>

They would need to require strenth, agility, and stamina in a sport. Cheerleading needs these requirements. They would need practices in order to get better, and would need coaches and have competitions like other sports. In order to be a cheerleader, people would have to learn to do flips, jumps, and other acrobatic moves. They would need enough energy to do difficult moves that may take practice in order to perfect. They would need strength to lift each other up and to throw each other in the air only if they have to. Cheerleading deserves to be named a sport because of the similarities it has with the requirements of sports.]]>

It cheerleaders take hours every single day practicing their routines the practice over and over again in order to get it perfect. They have to be strong in order to be able to carry one or two or maybe even three times their weight, which means that they have to work out and lift. A lot of cheerleaders have to take gymnastics also to be able to inprove their stunts, some also take dance because the need to be able dance gracefully. Cheerleading has practices, competitions, and summer camps like other sports so why do people thing that cheerledading isn't a sport. Cheerleading is very competitive now teams have to work together just like in football or soccer or any other sport. They have to rely on eachother to do their part just like in soccer if the defence doesnt protect the goal then the gollie has to do two jobs and it makes it harder, in cheerleading if the catcher doesn't catch the flyer then she/him will fall and get hurt. Some people don't think that Cheerleaders are athletes eeven though they work just as hard as a football player.]]>

Cheerleading is very athletic and physical- you must toss other athletes in the air, catch them, lift other teammates,perform a series of tumbling tricks, and balancing at the top of a human pyramid. Doing all these different stunts require a lot of pratice and workout. To do cheerleading, you must be flexible and work out alot to stay fit. Cheerleading can be very serious, many people have gotten seriously injured from differnt tasks (mentioned in American Academy of Pediatrics). People who do cheer work as hard as any other sport, you must condition, work out, stay in shape, stretch, and face your fears such as standing on top of a human pyramid or tumbling. Can you imagine one of our former presidents doing that? Well, George W. Bush was a former head cheerleader at Phillips Academy of Minnesota! Many people did/do cheer. Cheer is definately a sport.]]>

For example, the students says that &quot; cheerleading is a true sport because we have to be as strong as the football player to lift up our teamates to create a human pyramid, and we have to be as flexible as any gymnast to perform stunts such as back handsprings &quot;( introduction paragraph). This shows that, cheerleaders have to have the strength to lift up cheerleaders and they have to be athletic to, if the word athletic is in the sentence then its a true sport. This is important because, the public people think that cheer isnt a sport but if you really start researching it and looking at what the cheerleaders have to do then you will see that cheerleading is a sport. In addition, he says that &quot; athlete- a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina &quot; (student notes- dot one). This reveals that cheerleaders are athletic and have to do the same thing that football, volleyball, or soccer players have to do. This is important because, they started a debate on cheerleading so the research proves that it is a real true sport, just like football, or any other sport in highschool. I belive thathceerleading is a sport because they have to be athletci and be a strong as a football player too. In conclusion, I belive thathceerleading is a sport because they have to be strong enough to lift upflyers and strong enough to build a human pyramid. Cheerleadings is a sport also because thje have fast floorwork]]>

Cheerleading is one of the many hobbies that young girls and teenagers like to do in their free time. It isn't really much of a hobby, though. It's actually a sport because you sweat and work-out while you're dancing and being the center of attention. Even though they sweat and dance, people say it's more of a hobby than a sport for many reasons. One reason why people think it isn't a legitimate sport is because &quot; a cheerleader isn't a true athlete.&quot; An athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. Another reason is because people say that cheerleading is only for girls and it's &quot;not supposed to be called a sport.&quot; These people are wrong because these girls and boys who do cheer are very hard-working and strong, so in my opinion, cheerleading should be considered a sport.]]>

Most sport athletes do have these same traits, in which they also need strength, agility, or stamina in order for them to master their own sport. Second of all, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, cheerleading has evolved into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnatsics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air. Third of all, Title IX claims that it requires universities to offer equal athletic opportunites to both men and women. Another piece of information is that, quoted from a director of a competitive cheerleading program, is that &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms. Plus, cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898.]]>

The core of what it is to be a cheerleader is in the definition of an athlete, a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. The director of a competitive cheerleading program says, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore, it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; Some might say that cheerleading requires every more than most other sports. Under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a govering organization, its main goal must be to compete. Most cheer teams are required to practice everyday and usually compete in regionaln and national competitions that are sponsered by the National Cheerleading Organization to prepare for championship events. When cheering for a highschool, usually a high school cheer camp is offered the summer before school starts to bond with your team. Youth camps are offered for children not yet in highschool.]]>

Cheerleaders have many of these qualities because they need strength to lift others and support there weight while doing tricks and flips.They need the skill of a gymnast and the grace of a dancer. Cheerleading also combines other sports like running which requires stamina.Cheerleaders have to train for long hours to do things that even a star football player cannot succeed in. The US Court of Appeals said that cheerleading would be a sport if it had orginization and rules. There is a National cheerleading orginization that sponsers competitions on a regional and national level. There are coaches, camps andcompetions in cheerleading giving cheerleaders the an equal oppertunity to suceed. When cheerleading started out it was about suppoting a cheering for other sports but now it has evolved into a competitive sport just like anyother.When a male student at the University of Minnesota in 1898 bagna cheering at his schools football game he could have never invisioned it become what it is today with even a former president, George W.

Yes, cheeleading doesn't have as much contact with people as much as other sports around here but it is very athletic. An athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in excersizes, sports, or games requiring pshysical strength, agility, or stamina. Cheerleaders also aren't just the peppy group of girls on the sideline of football games. Evidence for this statement is said by the director of a competitive cheerleading program,&quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheerlleading is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; With that said cheerleading takes a lot of skill and it's not just for cheering on teams. There are also many famous cheerleaders out there as well. The national cheerleading organization sponsers regional and national competitions and championship events; high school cheer camps; youth camps. If we ever needed to put the girls in a cheer camp we know that we are supported by the National cheerleading organization. In fact, George W. Bush was the one who served head cheerleader when he was in high school so guys shouldn't be afraid to try out for cheerleading. It may seem like a girl sport but it does take a lot of strength and technique. In my opinion I believe that cheerleading is an athletic sport.]]>

Since cheerleading involves some of these qualities, cheerleaders are considered athletes. When most people think of an athlete, they think of someone who plays a sport, so in this case cheerleading would be considered a sport. All sports involve a lot of physical activity, which is another thing that cheerleading could relate to. Cheerleading is competitive and involves the execution of many complicated stunts that could be physically challenging. Title IX regulations state for an activity to be a sport, it must involve a coach, competitions, and practices, which would mean the cheerleading is indeed a valid sport.]]>

Quinnipiac ,a court case held in Connecticut, ruled that cheerleading was not a sport because it needed organization and clearly difined rules. I can say to you right now even though cheerleading happen to not be a sport two to four years ago,it is now.

Also need to be flexible like a gymnast. All these good causes and evidence help me conclude that cheerleading is a combination of many sports. Cheerleading is not just cheering for teams or for making crowds excited. This &quot;sport&quot; is but more than that its competing with other teams just like in soccer, softball, football and many other sports. Cheerleading does in fact have rules to be followed. This also allows for males and females to play in one team together. Joining cheerleading is very fun and does take time and effort to learn all the cheer moves, stunts, and more. And for that reason cheerleading has coachs and practice.]]>

So it's really hard to tell if it's a sport or not. I think cheerleading is a sport because sports are suppose to keep you in shape and cheerleadimg does that. Cheerleading is really important to some cheerleaders like other poeple think other sports are important to them. There are a lot of injures in cheerleadng but it seems like a really good and fun sport. &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bobies...and school athletic departments.&quot; This qoute shows that Cheerleading should be designated as a sport because of many reasons. Cheerleading also has coaches, practices and competitions which a sport is suppose to have. Cheerleading is all about having fun and getting tossed in the air. You have to be trained and ready to do all those things because injures might happen if your not. Cheerleading is a really big responablaity because you can break somthing really easy like by just one fall. Well i think that Cheerleading is a sport.]]>

We lift eachother and we are trained to don stunts which no ordinary person can do. There are tons of cheerleading injuries caused by fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics style tumbling, and complex stunts such as pyramid building and tossing athletes into the air. The American Academy of Pediotrics report on Cheerleaders said: &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; in a district court case in Conneticut in 2010, Biediger vs. Quinnipac University ruled that cheerleading is not a sport according to Title IX regulations. The decision was upheld in 2012 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which stated that cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport. Title IX regulations require universities to offer equal athletic oppurtunities to both men and women. It also states that a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization. The main goal must be to compete. The director of a competitive cheer team said that cheerleading is not just about cheering for teams, but its about competing.]]>

Cheerleading, like most sports, requires that you try out for the sport and allow the coach to see your capabilities and see if you have what it takes to make the team.

Biediger V.Quinnipiac university,in coneticut, has a different argument against cheerlaeding, they say cheerleading should NOT be a sport because the title IX regulations; dicision was upheld in 2012 by the U.A court of Appeals for the second circuit,whitch stated that cheerleading needed organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport. title IX regulations require universities to offer equal athletic opportunities to both men and women; undeer title IX, a sport must have choaches, practices, competitons during a defined season and a governing organization; its main goal must be to compete the director of a competitive cheerleading team says &quot;cheerleading isnt about cheering for the football team and basketball teams anymore; its about competing.the girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grasce of a dancer and the strength of a football player. cheering is more than yelling rah rah rah and shaking pompoms&quot;.former president George W.

Although this may seem easy to some I don't recall being able to pick up my friends and form a human pyramid, thats not talent its skill which is exactly why cheerleading should be a sport. Many people could say cheerleadin is not as worthy of the title &quot;sport&quot; well I tell you cheerleaders have there own organizations and championships just like football has there super bowl.

Cheerleading reuires strength, flexibility, athleticism, and much courage. Cheerleading isnt just about cheering your team on its about competing. If you do cheerleading you must have a lot of courage because you are thrown into the air and have to perform a stunt, the slightest mess up an you could easily fall and get seriously injured. I think if you tried cherleading for a month on a team you would believe its a sport because of the amount of strength, athleticism, and courage it takes to perform the stunts theese cheerleaders do. Many cheerleaders have to be able to perform standing flips now you can't deny that it takes courage and athleticism to do that. I hope you understand from this that cheerleading is a sport and how hard of a sport it is.]]>

They need to have lots of strength, grace, and skills to be able to do the acrobatics. They need to be able to challenge themselves and compete.

Its also about the competition and competeing. A cheerleader's goal is to compete and to win. Cheerleaders need to use strength, agility, and stamina to perform stunts and tricks to engage the crowd. Their performances also need to engage the team that is playing. To get them excited and pumped for the game. Cheerleading was formed by a group of college students to engage the crowd in the last football game of the season. President George W. Bush was a cheerleader when he was a senior in high school. Since cheerleading began, camps, campetitions, and championships have been formed to test a cheerleader's athletic ability.]]>

That means, according to the govenment, that cheerleading is a sport. But some of you still don't believe me? Listen to this news article from the American Academy of Pediatrics on cheerleading injuries: &quot;Over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year round activity consisting of fast paced floor routines with leaps and stunts, and complex stunts, like building a pyramid and tossing athletes in the air. Cheerleading should be designated as a sport so that it is subject by rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies, and school athletic departments. The Title IX regulations state that a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, a governing organization; its main goal is to compete. There was a court case in 2010 in Conneticut where cheerleading was not defined as a sport, but the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit took it in 2012, and said that cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could become a sport. That means that we should organize a team and clearly state the rules, and it would become a sport!]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[The student gives credible sources which support the claim of cheerleading being a true sport.One of the things stated was the fact of a cheerleader having to have many different traits to be a cheerleader such as have the strength of a football player or being as flexible as a gymnast.Another piece of evidence that the student gave was the definition of a athlete which shortened says you need to have physical strength,agility,or stamina.So in conclusion,these are some of the examples the student gave to support the claim of cheerleading being a sport or not. The second part of this argument she also gave is the other to sources i didnt recogize in the first paragraph.The second note she took from a reliable source was the american academy of pediatrics giving a result on cheerleading injuries and saying it should be designated as a sport because it follows regulations set by governing bodies and school athletic departments.One of the last examples comes from the origins of cheerleading where it was invented in 1898 by male cheerleaders to engage the crowd on the football teams last game of the season.these are some of the reasons that support the claim of cheerleading is it a sport or not?]]>

This quote is obviously true because, if they weren't as strong as a football player, how do they carry each other and twist and turn? How do they hold up a human pyramid without strength? Cheerleaders are very flexable, like a gymnast. They do the splits, front flips, back flips, etc. Without being flexable, how would they do all those moves? If you have to be as strong as a football player, and football is a sport, and be a gymnast and have endurance, that's being athletic. If you have to be a football player, and that's a very tough sport, plus you have to be a gymnast. That's 2 sports in one. I consider cheerleading to be a sport because if they don't practice really hard doing the human pyramid, they would never be able to do it. I think cheerleading is a sport because it requires physical activity.]]>

It is as dangerous as gymnastics, and gymnastics is a sport! It requires flexiblity just like gymnastics. It requires strength like boxing. many people consider cheerleading and easy activity but most of them cant even do a back handspring. Cheerleading isnt jus for cheering for another sport, its also about competing. its not only about yelling clever songs and shaking pom poms, they need to have skills like a gymnist or strength of a football player. And many guys think its a something for girls only but its not. It was actually invennted by a male student. cheerleading needs the strength of a male too. Cheerleaders go to competitions just like any other sport too. They have won many championships just like a football team or any other sport. They deserve to have the title of &quot;sport&quot;. cheerleaders have coaches, like any other sport. so why not call it a sport?]]>

It has to require the strength of a gymnast, a football player, and the grace of a dancer. Just because ypu shake pom poms in the air and say, &quot;RAH RAH RAH!!!&quot; doesn't mean it isnt a sport. It helps entertain a crowd and give confidence to the football players as they play, so that they might win. It is nessecary to do this and say it is a sport. It involves work and strenght. Therefore, chearleading should be considered a sport.]]>

The definition of an athlete according to the dictionary is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot;. This definition is important because an athlete is a person who plays in sports, and by definition, a person who has agility, stamina, and physical strength is considered an athlete. Also, the American Academy of Pediatrics gave a report on cheerleading and they said that over the years cheerleading has became a competitive year-round activity. Cheerleading includes parts of gymnastics for the tumbling, and upper body strength for tossing teammates into the air. Title IX regulations require that equal sport opportunities are to be given to both men and women, and under Title IX, a sport must consist of a coach, practices, competitions, and its main goal has to be to compete. So with this being said why shouldn't cheerleading be considered a sport? If it follows all of these regulations than what is stopping people from saying that cheerleading is a sport.]]>

There are dance compititiions right? there are also cheer competions as well, sponsored by the national cheerleading association. In all sports people have to train and go to practices or clases, and so do the people involved in cheerleading. Cheerleading has also been around for a while. Cheerleading was invented by some male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898 where members of the &quot;pep club&quot; as they called it back then, elected people called &quot;yell leaders&quot; to help amp up the crowd during the last game of the teams footbal season. Most sports were invented around that time as well. Also even one of our very own presidents, George W. Bush was a head cheerleader of Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, during his senior year of high school. That should be proof that even one of our own presidents supports cheerleading. Also it really isn't about football anymore now that there are competitions and well organized organizations that support cheerleading.]]>

There's the fact that cheerleading is not an effortless sport. In fact, this sport needs three times the amount of effort that other sports need! According to the American Academy of Pediatricts, cheerleading is just as competitive as any other sport. Probably even more. The Director of a competitive cheerleading program also said that, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; The student himself even says almost the same exact thing, and he himself is a cheerleader. To make things basic by reading the simple definition of the word athlete, cheerleaders could be considered to be one of these athletes. In the student's claim, he states that cheerleaders &quot;have to be as strong as a football player... and we have to be as flexible as any gymnast to perform stunts such as back handsprings&quot;. The dictionary states that in order to be considered to be an athlete, one must require physical &quot;strength, agility, or stamina.&quot;. Since the student obviously claimed that cheerleading involves strength and agility, cheerleaders are considered to be athletes. And what do athletes do? Sports. Therefore, cheerleading is considered to be a sport.]]>

Cheerleaders get uniforms just like swim teams or basketball teams, they have routines just like other sports have a &quot;play book&quot; or have choreographed, and it has physical activness. Just because there is not a ball does not mean it is not a sport. Like swimming or ice skating. Even dancing is considered a sport, but not all who play are considered athletes, which needs to change. Lets say I was a ballerina, ballet is a sport, but I would not be considered an athlete. Cheerleading is a sport, but they are not athletes, they cheer for athletes, is the perception of their hobbie.]]>

If dancing is a sport, then cheerleading certainly should be. Also, cheerleaders need to have a boost of spirit and a fire to be able to compete. This is another part of sports as well. One more thing is that if you are discouraging young girls to not cheer because i t is not a sport, they are most likely not to do it. If kids are active, then that is a sport.]]>

The actual defintion of an athlete is &quot;A person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; So according to the dictionary cheerleading has athletes because they exercise and this requires strength.Cheerleaders have to hold other cheerleaders in the air and even do very difficult stunts. From the &quot;American Academy of Pediatrics&quot; report, the author names athletic skills cheerleaders need to achieve, &quot;......such as pyramid building and tossing in the air.&quot; That was only one reason why cheerleading should be an official sport. They also have to have ample strength and agility to even make it in practice. All day long cheerleaders have to hold themselves up to do some of the many stunts for their performance. A director of a competitive cheerleading program states that &quot;Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; That director is very true because it is now mostly about competing and winning. Is'nt that the same goal all the other sports have, to win? Thirdly, cheering is very in need of endurance because the cheerleaders have to jump up and down, fly in the air, and be cheering on for the crowd. That sounds like a lot of hard work and that is what makes cheerleading competitive. The website of international cheer organization argues &quot; Cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898.&quot; so the male cheerleaders had to of had endurance to flip and dance around for a while. Just like most of the other official sports in the world, cheering uses endurance.]]>

My second point is that according to the American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries, the activity has evolved into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastic-style tumbling, and complex stunts. And as I mentioned earlier, there are regional and national competitions, championships, and summer camps, showing that cheerleading is as organized &amp; physically demanding as any other sport.]]>

Cheerleading started off as something just for fun, yet over time it has been extremely competitive. American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries--&quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; Cheerleading is not just an easy hobby some girls and boys enjoy participating in, cheerleading is much, much more. If anyone wanted to become a cheerleader they would have to be determined, put their body to work, and focus. Moreover, when it comes to cheerleading you can not just sit around, hard work is needed. In all sports hard work, and athletic ability is most important, just like it is in cheerleading, so how could anyone say cheerleading is not a sport? Cheerleading fits all the requirements that other sports have. Director of a competitive cheerleading program--&quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; This quote illustrates that cheerleading is more than you would expect, and cheerleaders are filled with dedication and hard work.]]>

Its about the group who has the best rutine. not bout as much indurance and stamina as other sports like baseball,football,basketball, rugby,ect.. another reason i think this is the fact they just stand there move around a little bit and just make statues,pyramids... that does'nt require much. Another reason is because the official meaning of the word (athlet) is a person who is trained or skilled in exercise in physical strenght,agility, or stamina. And the only things cheerleading requires is agility and strenght. it does'nt have all the requirements. Cheerleading also needs better coaches and better organization and clearly defined rules. those are the reasons ithink cheerleading is not really considerd a sport. by the information given to me. in the students notes shown above.]]>

He has looked up from magazine articles to facts about the former president. For example when he wrote that the American academy of pediatrics was reporting ceerleading injuries it showed that it was hard work. It wasnt just a bunch of girls yelling and shaking their pompoms it was hard work. Ton prove to everybody that cheerleading is indeed a sport . That it even caused them to say &quot; regulations set forth by sport governing bodies.&quot;. It just goes to prove tht sometimes things arent like what they seem to be. He is even going back on the history of cheerleading and saying how it all started. He is reffering to how some people dont take the sport serously and arent even considered a sport. Personally I think that cheerleading is as much of a sport as soccer or football or any other sport. It ctually seems a bit ridiculous to not see it as a sport. Here he is throwing in all of these that say it is a ligitimate sport. It has coaches, practices, competitions and even tryouts. The point tht he is trying ton prove is that it should be taken more sreiously and should be endured in more schools.]]>

Cheerleaders must have the &quot;skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player&quot;. Cheerleading is more complex then most people may think. Cheerleaders have to work more, and have to be physically fit. &quot;Over the last century (100 years), cheerleading has evolved dramaitcally into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as a pyramid buliding and tossing athletes into the air.&quot; Cheerleading does qualify as a sport, and has every right to be one. Male students invented cheerleading at the University of Minnesota in 1898. Our former president George W. Bush, even served as the head cheerleader in his senior year of high school. Cheerleaders use strength and agility, and just to cheer on their fellow school mates. It takes a lot to be a cheerleader and the people who are cheerleaders are proud. Nobody should bring down each other, and the orginal point of the sport was to show support to their school and friends. Not enough people are giving cheerleading enough credit. The sport takes just as much effort as any other sport.]]>

Cheerleading requires cheerleaders to have very strong muscles, and have great agility. Over time, cheerleading have evolved from just pep-talk to full on pep-talk and stunts too. Cheerleaders have been trained to do backflips, leaps, tumbling, and the stereotypical human pyramid. These evolutions require cheerleaders to have an extensive amount of training so they won't get hurt. Many bad things may have happen during cheerleading, but improvements can be made. A coach can be provided to a team of cheerleaders to train them and ensure their safety. Cheerleaders are often girls, but boys can join in too. They could be mascots. Cheerleading is possible to anbody who can cheer, dance, and have good strength. In the origin of cheerleading, cheerleading was invented by males who cheered on their football team of UCM in 1898. Cheerleading has enough rules and a good enough of an origin story to prove its worth as a real sport.]]>

Bush back when he was in high school in his senior year at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Just like other sports cheerleading has camps which is the National cheerleading organization. Cheerleading isn't just cheering for teams. The director of competitive cheerleading program had said that &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah 'rah 'rah and shaking pompoms.&quot; Not just girls cheerlead boys do too. In cheerleading they have coaches, practices, and seasons just like in a ny other soprts. They also have competitions and compete. They don't just cheer for teams they do other things as well.]]>

The true definition of a athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games that require physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot; and I'm pretty sure a cheerleader has to be trained and skilled enough to pull off some of the things that they can do. Now while you may be saying, &quot;But cheerleading is just a bunch of girls yelling and throwing around pompoms,&quot; I would have to strongly disagree. Cheerleading is now becoming a very competitive sport that requires a lot of strength and agility to perform. Let's just say that if something is popular and competitive enough to have regional and national competitions, in my eyes, it deserves to be called a sport.]]>

Cheerleaders go to competitions, some in different states, to go up against other cheer teams. A dancer, gymnast, and being as strong as a football player must all be in them. And if those are true sports, then cheerleading must certainly be one too. Title IX says, &quot;A sport must have coaches, practices, and competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; it's main must be to compete.&quot; By that statement, and comparing that sentence with what the cheerleaders do, they go to practices, have a coach to teach them what to perform, and they do compete like I previously said. From a cheer organization made from the students of University of Minnesota in 1898, cheerleading has come a long way from just getting people all wild and pay attention to the game. They now compete in national and regional competitions, going up against other organizations from around the country. By the proof of the students notes, you must agree that cheerleading is a real sport and just cheering for the football team is a another form of practice for them.]]>

Cheerleading is a sport for so many reasons such as the qualities that make up a cheerleader are similar to what makes up a football player like both must have strength to either block a person or lift someone up and both must have balance like making a human pyramid does include strength but it also includes balance that way cheerleaders won't fall off. Another reason all sports must have coaches, practices, competitions in a season, and a governing organization which cheerleading does ( Title IX regulations). Finally all sports must have caused injuries to sport members and cheerleading does. Over the last century cheerleaders have gotten injuries from fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps to complex stunts (American Academy of Pediatrics). Cheerleading is a sport that allows cheerleaders to be athletes. An athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina (dictionary). Cheerleading allows competitions happen all over the world and that school can be grateful to win a championship competition (National cheerleading organization). Cheerleading is a sport that can cause so many injuries and can give cheerleaders a chance to be an athlete.]]>

Cheerleaders are at risk of falling of a human pyramid, hurting themselves while in the air, or hurting someone else while they are performing a dangerous trick. You have to be almost as strong as any other athletes while cheerleading to perform all the stunts and hold other teamates up. American Academy of Pediatrics report on several cheerleading injuries. If golf is a sport, cheerleading should be too. According to the dictionary, an athlete is an individual who is trained or skilled in excercises, sports or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. I believe cheerleading requires strength for them to hold and throw up their teamates, agility to perform tricks and stunts, and training to LEARN the the tricks Cheerleading can be one of the trickiest sports out there. You need to have the &quot;skills of a gymnast, grace of a dancer, and strength of a football player.&quot; Requiring all these traits while looking graceful while doing it is definetly a difficult task.

Another reason is that the Title IX regulations that a sport must have coaches and practice which they do. THere are also more reasons that support the student's claim. One reason is that the student wrote that there are high school cheer camps which all sports do. Another good reason is that an athlete is a person who is trained in a sport must have agility strength and endurance which cheerleaders do have. The last reason that mainly claims that cheerleading is a sport is that cheerleaders have a gymanast's skills, a dancer's grace and the strength of a football player which are all sports!]]>

All sports like basketball, baseball, and football have this so why do people say cheerleading not a sport. Chereleading is a very physical sport not everyone can do it. Chereleading isn't just about cheering for a football or basketball team anymore. The boys and girls who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, amd strength of a football player. I don't know how cheerleading isn't a sport to some people. Just because you don't have as much physical contact with someone from another team like football doesn't mean it's not a sport. The boys and girls that cheer have jump, leap, and dance around. Over the last century, cheerleading has evolved into a competitive, physically demanding, and year-round thing. This is why cheerleading is a true sport.]]>

Cheerleaders perform in all sorts of places such as, highschool games, camps and youth camps.

Does that not explain enough? Like the passage says, &quot;cheerleading is more than yelling 'rah rah rah' and shaking pompoms&quot; It is also very competative. They go and &quot;battle&quot; other schools just like the football team, basketball team, and the volletball team. so yeah, cheerleading is a real sport. Another thing to explain, is that our president, George W. Bush was a head cheer of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusettes during his senior year. So, are you saying that our president did something that wasn't a sport? Do you think he wouldv'e done it if he had thought it wasn't a sporyt. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Not in a million years. So I hope that is enough evidence for you. Bye, Student]]>

Therefor a cheerleader is an athlete because cheerleading has evolved into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air. People also believe it should be a sport due to injuries and rules that occur. American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading: &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; Also cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898. Members of the &quot;pep club&quot; elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crowd during the football team's last game of the season. Even former president George W. Bush, served as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massechusetts, during his senior year of high school. Those are some interesting facts about why a cheerleader should be considered an athlete and cheerleading should be considered a sport.]]>

This task of carrying a person with your body and hands is something that cheerleaders do but football players struggle to do. Also when your in a pyramid you have to have great balance and strength just like a football palyer. For example, in a pyramid 3 people are the bottom carrying each 3 people and they need the balance to carry 3 people for atleast 30 seconds which is extremely difficult. So the sport of cheerleading is really hard and athletic and you need to have a lot of the same capabilities of a football player. Next is cheereading you need the balance and flexibilty of a gymnast to do most of the routines. For example the American Board of Pediatrics said that cheerleading has become a physically demanding sport in which people keep getting hurt more and more.For examle tossing people into the air seems easy but to catch them without messing up is extremely hard. Also cheerleaders have begun doing fast paced floor routines which are serious and have hurt many gymnasts.Finally gymnastics should be a sport because it has a lot of the same risks as playing another sport like basketball and football.]]>

For example, fast past floor routines with leaps and jumps,gymnastic-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pryamid building and tossing athletes in the air. However, some people may still think chearleading isnt a sport.Biediger v. Quinnipiac University-a 2012 court case in connecticut, which ruled the chearleading is not a sport, according to the tittle XI regulations; decision was upheld in 2012 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which stated chearleading needed better organization and clearly define rules before it could be considered a sport. But, American Academy of Pediatrics report on chearleading injuries-&quot;Chearleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athlete departments.&quot;. chearleading meets all the requirements to be a sport.]]>

Cheerleaders have physical strength, agility, and stamina or they wouldn't be able to do gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing other atheletes in the air.People who cheer must have skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. George W. Bush was the head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898 to engage the crowd during the football team's last game of the season. Cheerleading also has regional and national competitions and championship events; high school cheer camps and youth camps just like any other sport also has.]]>

Here he states that it takes the same amount of strength, ability, and agility to be an athlete which is all true. Cheerleading is just as well a sport as soccer, football, baskteball, and track. Cheer takes the same amount of leg strength as soccer, the muscle strength and willing to take a hit as well as a football player, the same amount to catch the variable, focus, and screaming as basketball, and the same amount of running as track. Cheer, you can basically say is mainly all these different types of sports combined. Maybe cheerleading can do more than all these sports, which actually can. Cheer does a lot of running going from stunt to stunt, rallying, tumbling, and going formation to formation, takes a lot of strength bringing the flyers up to a stunt, throwing girls to a cradle and full down, and pushing yourself off the ground and pullung your hips up durring back hand springs, roundoffs, and tucks, takes a lot of leg strength squating for the stunt and holding girls up, for running formation to formation, pushing for tumbling, and pushing with a lot of power for hurdlers and toe touches. People say cheerleading is just where girly girls go to cheer on boys at games and do nothing but hold a pom pom, but in reality cheerleaders hold up with stuff every single sport has to deal with, compete and win, and do everything a football player or basketball player can do and still manage to keep smiles on their faces.]]>

Secondly you must be at every game and cheer for the players.You must be in the hot sun at football games and be there at the same early time as the players.

To be a gymnist, you need proper training to be able to pull off those flips you see. All this training shows how a cheerleader is an athlete by dictionary meaning. A sport also has to have a little bit of competition to show that a team is truly good and that they have been training. The American Academy of Pediatrics also said that the cheerleading sport has evolved to something bigger than it ever was. Although the courts have made cheerleading not a valid sport in 2010, the court upheld what they said because the cheerleading required better organization and because of the Title IX regulations. But that doesnt make sense because the IX regulations state that the sport needs coaches, practices, competition, and a defined season, and cheerleading has that so it is a sport by definition and by law.]]>

You also have to remenmber the things that your top cheerleader had told you to do. Also their is lile two sports in one in cheereleading so thety really should just make it a sprt already. Maybe if they considered it a sport more people like guys would want to be on the team. Dont you think it would be cool to have a liutttle more boys on thr tream.? If it were to be a officalsport maybe pople would not call the guys on the cheereleading team a fag, gay atc. Those words are hurtful and it can harm someone. They get called that because everyone says cheerleading is a girl thing. Like ive said more than onve maybe you guys should just make it offical and call it a sports team for both biys and girls. So that the guys on tyhe team dont get called those hurtful names yeah know. If you just look at it in a different way maybe cheereleading will call more guys attentin. If the sport cheerleading was called a sports for both boys and girls. Im pretty sure that more people would want o be on the team becaause it is a sport. They would be able to show of their true talent if it was for both boys and ngirls. Well it is but like if it said national that cheereleading is gonna be a sport for noth boys and girls. Me personally i think if the world would spread the word about cheerleading being for both girls and boys maybe it would be more better for the guys who would want to be on a team. But maybe the only thing holding them back from wanting to be pon the team is cause other stronger and more aggersive guys would be jerks to them.]]>

All cheerleaders have to work hard to accomplish these aspects of this competitive sport. People say that cheerleading is not a sport but according to the Dictiionary an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; There aren't a lot of injuries that you think would occur. Cheerleading is a sport for both men and women. It's not all about cheering at football games anymore, it's all about competing. Cheerleading was started by the &quot;pep club&quot; at the University of Minnesota in 1898. Former president George W. Bush was head cheerleader at Philips Academy in Andover Massachusetts, during his senior year of high school. As you can see cheerleading is a great sport, for both women and men, and involves the same amount of work for all of the other sports out there.]]>

From lifting people in human pyramids, which takes strength, to doing stunts such as a backhand spring, which takes a lot of training and practice. This sport isfitting all of the criterias, and thats not even all we have to do! As the Title IX regulations say a sport requires coaches practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization. As the Director of a competitive cheerleading program says&quot; Cheerleading isnt about cheering for football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competeing. The boys band girls who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.Cheering is more than yelling rah, rah, rah, and shaking pompoms.&quot; and sincve it is so much of a sport that it has a DIRECTOR shouldn't it be treated like one?Cheering is a sport, no matter what other people say.]]>

However, if you were to take the star of the footbal team, who is supposed to be athletic and strong, i bet he wouldnt last a day doing what cheerleaders do. He might be able to lift the cheerleaders up and hold them, but he wouldnt be able to do any of the flexible things cheerleaders do. Cheerleaders can do splits, back handsprings, kartwheels, and even backflips. You dont see football players doing that do you? No, all you see is football players bumping heads with eachother. Maybe, thats why people dont think cheerleading is a real sport because there is no physical activity. Golf, doesnt have any physical contact but people stiill consider golf a real sport. Everyone is used to only seeing cheerleaders at football games jumping around and saying chants. But cheerleading has changed tremendously, all over the United States there are cheerleading competitions. Some even have money rewards if you win but usually its a huge trophy and bragging rights for your team.]]>

To be able to catch someone and lift them up over your shoulders you obviously have to be strong. Also you have to be in shape to keep up with the rutine witch probably involves running, jumping, ect. that makes your heart bump and you start to sweat so that is obviously it is giving you a work out. Cheerleading isnt for everyone, in every sport you might get hurt theres a big risk, espesally in cheerleading because you're off the ground and you're trusting someone else to keep you up. Now imagine someone is trying to carry another person but cant hold them up and the person being carried falls and gets hurt,]]>

Even one of our presidents was a cheer leader. Cheer leaders do alot and it costs alot of money to be a cheer leader. Also the national cheer organization says its a sport. So that makes it a sport. Now lets talk common core. I believe the state of california wasted their time and money with it. Even the teachers think its mental. They even told us to guess on these questions because of how crappy they are. S please just go back to STAR testing so the we dont get screwed next year when these actually count for the next school year. Thanks. Have a nice day(:]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Cheerleading was proved that it can be as hard as any tough sport. You have to have many skills and toughness to be a cheerleader, many training is required. As well as hard work and dedication to be in the team. Being a professinal cheerleader and or a professinal coach cheerleader pays off with a good amount of money. Winning many regional and national competitions in cheerleading is the same as winning any competition in any sport. There is even programs amd training camps to those who are dedicated to cheerleading. A sport has to have practices, a full team, coaches or a coach, and competitions, which is everything being in cheer is about (Title X). Cheer isn't exactly a &quot;sport&quot; everyone is intreasted in but those who are take it very serious and some even become famous and are in professional television and competitions. It is the main goal to compete and try to win. Some might not agree cheer is a full sport, but trying is not as easy at it looks. You would fall get hurt get MANY bruises and be sore just as well as a full supported sport. Any sport is fun to try and can be entertaining as many would say, ALTHOUGH not any ''sport'' can MAKE a sport more entertaining. There were said rules have to be applied to cheer in order to make it a full sport (Student Notes) well some rules can be no messing up more than two times, proper shoes(uniform), proper launguage etc. Even famous people have tryed out cheer in highschool or in somewhere. A example of someone famous who has been in cheerleading is, George W. Bush. He was even head cheerleading in his senior year. Which demonstrates anyone can try out ,wether if your a guy or girl (Students notes). Cheerleading isnt a famous sport that everyone knows or trys out, such as basketball or football or any sport of a sort but it does make a another sport with a crowd more excited. Although cheerleading doesnt have much rules they are well organized. Taking a risk of getting hurt is what cheerleading is all about as well as any highschool sport. The althelte gets thrown into the air and the base has to be careful and make sure they land safely. Anything can happen and someone can hurt. Either it can be the people catching a person, not doing a flip correctly, twisting or breaking a part of a body, and even falling from a pyramid straight to the floor. Cheer has been around for quite a while that by now it should strongly be considered a sport.]]>

Bush served as head cheerleader of Philips Academy in Andover Massachusetts. Cheerleading was invented at the University of Minnesota in 1898 when members of the pep club elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crowd during sports games. The National Cheerleading Organization holds regional and national competitions and championship events for cheerleading, they also sponsor high school cheer camps, youth camps and many other fun and interesting activities that involve cheerleading. Over the last century, cheerleading has evolved into a complex, competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity and using complex stunts like pyramid building and throwing athletes in the air. Cheerleading really is a sport that requires the utmost physical and mental ability, if a person lacks concentration power and they are a base of a human pyramid then all of the people that are above them are in danger of falling and therefore cheerleading is a legitimate sport.]]>

To actually perform all the stunts the cheerleaders do, you need to be strong enough to lift up another person, and flexible enough to do back flips and cartwheels. According to the dictonary; an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot;. Cheerleading also requires skills that most school sports also need. Cheerleading isn't only about cheering for your school team, but competition as well. Cheerleading has dramatically changed since first being invented, because of the air of competition the surrounds it. Both men and women can become cheerleaders, and it takes much practice to become as strong and flexible as one should be. According to sport regulations, for something to become a sport it needs: universities to offer equal athleticopportunities to both men and women, it must have coaches, practices, competitions, and a governing organization. Cheerleading fills in those requirments and may be one of the hardest sports because of the hard physical training.]]>

Many of the cheerleaders make sure that they have the elegance of a dancer so they are able to do the rountine smoothly and gracefully. Also, many people think cheerleading is just about cheering people on. Thats wrong, they have to compete in competitions. Some people also think that if you're a cheerleader then you're not an athlete.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[This student strongly agrees that cheerleading is a sport because cheerleading needs to have the ability to have the right strength to pick up your team mates to do the human phyramid. For cheerleadings to have this ability they need to have the right stance and just the right strength to be able to pick up other people. With out this strength they wouldn't be able to hold up the human pyramid. Alot of football stars have alot of strength but people are trying to fight the fact that cheerleading and football needs the same amount of strength, but the football players gets tackled and even injured. However,the girls on the team has to be thrown in the air with alot of height and the right formation. Even though they don't get tackled they still are at a risk and anytime they can get thrown in the air and fall die and break or bone, or even worse lose their life.&quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot;(Dictionary-athlete) This quote explains the basic requirements of a cheerleader because you need stamina since these girls will be running around doing flips,holding up other team members, and even dancing. Cheerleading is a fun sport for girls who aren't accepted in other sports or even good at those. These are sports where they can express their selves through different dance moves, and flips. Everyone gets their time to shine bright as every one is flashing pictures at them. The second reason why Cheerleading is a sport because of the flexibility you need for you to be able to do many flips. Cheerleading is like gymnastics but instead you are cheering. These two sports has many different unigue differences from each other but one that stands out for cheerleading is that this gves you a skill for leadership. We have many leaders in our generation and they have made a difference in the society. &quot;former president George W. Bush, served as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts , during his senior year of high school.&quot;(Famous cheerleaders) Tis quote explains that even our former president was a cheerleader who has lead our country. Not only is Cheerleading a leader sport but it builds confidence in someone. The leaders will be able to help build confidence in thier team mates by being a person to stand by their side through everything the team is going through at the time.]]>

Cheerleading takes just as much or even money to keep it going as a sport. Just like football, which is a legitimate sport, there are tournaments and championship events held all over. I know this because the national cheerleading organization &quot;sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events;high school cheer camps;youth camps.&quot; There is a lot of money put into the sport of cheerleading. Cheerleading requires tons of money to keep it going, just like football, basketball or any other sport. Cheerleading is a sport like any other common sports you would hear about.

In the sport/activity cheerleading you need to have good strength to hold up people, you need it to create a human pyramid and you also need it for many other things. You need agility to keep running around jumping in the air for a long period of time or however long your routine is. You need stamina to also do the same. So technically you need to be an athlete to be able to compete in this activity. When you need athletic ability to particiapte in a sport i think it is appropriate for anyone to consider it a sport. Any activity that you do that requires phyical ability and anything that needs a certain athletic skill should be required a sport. It isn't right that these athletes work so hard and put many hours in and have people disrespect them and call it not a sport. If i were a cheerleader and i put long hard hours in and someone called it not a sport I'd be furious.]]>

If the wernt strong how could they posibly throw someone up and into the air. Cheerleaders also have to have endurance. If they didnt they would pass out before they even finish there dance.

They also need agility to run or move fast and do such moves like a back handspring,you also need to be flexible to perform the back handsprings. Cheerleading should also be a sport because it is a year round activity that takes time and effort and because cheerleaders get injured just like basketball players and football players do.

Why wouldn't cheerleading be a sport? It does include everything any average sport would. To be considered a sport, the activity mus include coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; it's main goal must be to compete. That is exactly what cheerleading is, competing against others with coaches, practices, and competitions are during a defined season.

Cheerleaders don't just ruin their pom poms or stutter, they get injured too. Cheerleaders pull muscles by stretching too much, and their arms get fatigued by carrying too many people. Cheerleaders suffer just as much as football playrers and gymnasts do. Everyone that watches cheerleaders just think that we're out there cheering for the football teams; well, we're not. Cheerleading isn't about going out there shouting 'rah, rah, rah', jumping around, and waving our pom poms in different directions. It's about going out there and showing everyone that we're just as good as those people playing in the field. Cheerleaders compete in various competitions just like other athletes do. We win medals, trophies and plaques just like them; and we work as hard as them to recieve those rewards.]]>

But this is because they don't know all the hard work that goes on with being a cheerleader. To be a cheerleader, you must have many certain things. Such as, physical strength, agility and stamina. You must be in good shape to do stunts, leaps and strong enough to hold other cheerleaders up. If you do not have any of these or you are not in good shape, then you won't be able to be a good cheerleader. Just like a football player or a basketball player, if they do not add up to what they need to be a good player, then they can not do it. Which is why cheerleading should be known as a sport. Cheerleading isn't what everyone thinks it is. Everyone believes cheerleaders are just people to cheer on our spors team. But now, it is more than that. Cheerleaders go to compettitions and think of many different routines to do for those competitions. At games yes we cheer on the sport but we also have to get the crowd going and that could be hard.

So who is to say that cheerleaders are not athletes. Seeing as athletes play sports, it is certain that cheerleading is a sport. We, cheerleaders put in a lot of training time, sometimes even more than the more popular sports like football or basketball and we require just as much strength. We must lift up other team members and throw them up in the air. Not to mention, we have to make sure we catch them EVERY time! In a 2012 disrict court case in Connecticut, Title IX regulations said, &quot;Cheerleading needs better organization and and clearly defined rules before it can be considered a sport.&quot; I disagree seeing as we have so many rules already. We have to be in perfect synchronization and hit every formation. If not, we can cause serious injuries. &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about sompeting. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, hte grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; This quote comes directly from a director of a competitive cheerleading program and completely agree with them. When someone thinks of cheerleading, they probably think of a group of kids at a fottball game yelling cheers to support the home team. Since then, cheer has evolved very much. Now it is all about how many flips you can do, the endurance to keep going even though its difficult, and being determined. It takes a lot of practice and will to be at the top of a pyramid, especially knowing that you can fall and get hurt. But it all fades away once you realize that this is your team and you trust them. Therefore, it is fairly obvious to everyone what requires so much strength and agility.]]>

The American Academy of Pediatrics reported, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumblin, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athlrtrs in the air&quot;. This passage proves that gymnastics is not a simple and non skillful sport. It has many stunts that require a lot more strength and agility than you think. Cheerleading is also not only for girls, many boys do it too. Our former president George W Bush, served as a cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, during his senior year of high school. Cheerleading was actually invented by men. Male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898 elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crowd at football games.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[This students note is good, but if i had to change anything I would change the run on sentences. Also the let downs. There is many people who wanna cheerlead. This note makes it seem like you have to be a sertain person to cheerlead. Everyone has a dream, and for some its cheerleading. Also no one is good at something right of the back. They need time to practice. Just because they are not Skilled in gymnastics, not a good dancer, or have the strength of a football player doesnt mean they cant cheerlead. Yes thats important but its okay if there not. So try taking some of that neggative things out of your note. Another thing is you should keep your information in order! You have great details and thats important but it's all mixed up all over into one note and its going to confusse others. Yes, they will learn; but they may not really understand. Also dont put your websites in the note. Once you have finished writting the whole note then at the bottom corner you can write down where you got all of your information. Over all it's good. And remember; cheerleading is a sport. It takes movment and excirsize and having fun just like all other sports.]]>

'Cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898; members of the ??pep club?? elected ??yell leaders?? to engage the crowd during the football team's last game of the season (Website of international cheer organization).' It was invented by males and was created to tie into that current sport. Well since then cheerleading as rocketed and now many favours would want it to be a sport. You can't just be anybody to do cheerleading. You need athelism and by that I mean you need strenght, flexibility and gracefulness. Strenght for holding. Flexibility for stunts and tricks. Gracefulness for moves, transitions between the moves and for being holded . There is one counter-claim and it is stated here: '...which stated that cheerleading needed better organizated and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport(Biediger v. Quinnipiac University).' In cheerleading you do have a coach and you do have teammates (essentially), however there are no rules. However if there were rules they would be along the same lines of dancing such as creating the choreograghy and what moves may or may-not be performed. I believe that cheerleading is a true sport and that is why.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[&quot;A person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Is the dictionary defintion of an athlete. As explained by the director of a competitive cheerleading program, &quot;Cheerleading isn't aboiut cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more then yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms&quot;. Cheerleading requires a large amount of physical and mental strength just like any other sport. So cheerleaders fit the definition of an athlete. If they're athletes, which they are without a doubt, cheerleading must be a sport. The boys and girls push through hours of practices, and have to be increadibly strong. With the flexibility of a rubber band, jumps like basketball players, strength of football players, tumbling like gymnasts, there's no way cheerleaders aren't athletes and cheerleading is not a sport. Along with all of the physical strength cheerleaders need, they also need dedication and determination. Even though it's a performance sport so they make it look simple, it is not easy to do. Cheerleaders are constantly being injured from, and have to push through, falling flyers to tearing their ACL while tumbling. The American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries stated, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competative, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air&quot;. These skills are challenging to learn and compete, so there are many bumps in the road. However, cheerleaders push through all of the injuries whether they're bumps or a concussion. Cheerleaders go through a ton of physical pain at times, but they're determined so that doesn't come close to stopping them. While competing nothing stands in their way. They can be competing at national competitions or just a local, and they'll push through just as much if not more pain than football players. How can you say cheerleading not a sport when they have to be incredibly athletic? Afterall, they don't just have to catch a ball but instead their fellow team members.]]>

For instance the &quot;title 4 regulations&quot; say that for something to be a sport it must &quot;have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and its main goal must be to compete&quot;. Cheerleading has all of this since we have practices and competions we try to win at. Cheerleading also has coaches that help us learn cheers, dances and things like that. Cheerleading meets all the requirments so its classified as a sport. One other major thing on why cheerleading is a legitimate sport is because mainly anyone could do cheerleading. Because its not only just for girls. For instance our former president George W. Bush was also a cheerleader at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Also cheerleading was first started in 1898 by male students at the University of Minnesota. They were members of the pep club but they were asked to be &quot;yell leaders&quot; at other sporting events to have the crowd engage with the game. cheerleading is a sport and any gender could participate in it too.]]>

Since gymnastics, football, and dance are all considered to be sports, cheerleading is a sport as well. Also, since cheerleading involves athletic competitions, it is a sport.

An example that shows this from The American Academy of Pediarics, and it explains, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnast-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; This quote shows that cheerleaders require skills to do stunts, and other special skills such as even gymnast abilities to pull off some floor routines. Another reason why cheerleading should be claimed as a sport is how it acts just like all other team sports. According to the Dictionary, an athlete is, &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; This shows that cheerleading can be called a sport because I know that it takes physical strength to be able to lift other cheerleaders above the ground. Another example that cheerleading is just the same is from American Academy of Pediatrics, and it explains, &quot; Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; This quote shows that cheerleading should be designated as a sport because t has the same qualities as any other sport.]]>

It is extremely hard and cheerleaders have to be strong to lift up that much weight to make the human pyramid. A cheerleader must be strong and lithe to lift someone their size or greater. This is just like a football player having to be strong to defend a quarterback or make a long snap to another player. Also, cheerleaders must be flexible and athletic to do things such as back handsprings or tower flips during a routine. This is just like a gymnast doing the bars or a routine with flips Both require much concentration, discipline, and flexiblity, not to mention endurance to do some of the things that they accomplish.]]>

We all need to train just as hard as any other athlete to become fit, strong, and skilled in what we do. Saying cheerleading isn't a sport would be like saying soccer isn't a sport. For all you people out there saying that cheerleading isn't a sport should re-think waht they believe. A sport could be something as simple as put-put. As me or any other athlete out there would say, cheerleading is a sport and should be treated as one. Cheerleading requires skill, a lot of skill. If one of you big, tough football players were to come down here and try to form a pyramid, you wouldn't be able to. That's because you're not trained to be a cheerleader. Sure, you guys have formations, but it is probably much harder to be able to do what we have to do. We have to do flips, catch people, throw people, and lift people. Football players have to run, catch and sometimes throw. If you ask me, I would say cheerleading is more of a sport than football.]]>

The girls and boys who cheer must have the skill of gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; This shows how hard cheerleaders actually have to work. The sencond piece of evidence I found was the dictionary definition,&quot;athlete: a person who is trained or skilled in excersises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Every cheerleader has to do everything the definition mentioned. The last piece of evidence I found was a quote from the American Academy of Pediatrics report, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitice, physical demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts,such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; This shows that the cheerleaders work hard year round.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Cheerleading should definitely be considered a sport because cheerleaders fullfill the definition an athlele and they should be cvonsidered one. The definition of an &quot;athlete&quot; is,&quot;a person who is trined or skilled in excercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility , or stamina.&quot; Cheerleading is on par with this exact definition. The sport uses phyical strength to lift other people over their heads and hold them in their position, which requires a great deal of strength. Cheerleaders have to throw each other up into the air and have the strength to catch them on their way down. They also have to use their strength to do their complex rountines that include handsprings, front/back flips, cartwheels, and other advanced coreography. A director of a competitive cheerleading program even stated that cheerleading was not about just cheering for football or basketball games anymore, that cheerleading has been taken to an advanced competitive level. Cheerleaders must have &quot;the skills of a gymnast,the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player&quot; according to that director. Cheerleaders have a complicated job and their work should be respected as a sport. Some say cheerleading doesn't have a proper set of rules to be considered a sport. During a court case called Biediger v, Quinnipiac University in 2010, this statement was spoken and the case said that cheerleading could not be considered a sport. This was due to the lacking of a set of rules. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, &quot;Cheerleading should be considered a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; This clearly shows that in order for cheerleading to gain that set of rules, they need to be stated as a sport. According to the same Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries, cheerleading has evolved to a physically demanding and competitive activity. This could result in an increased number of injuries. Without a set of rules, those numbers could sky rocket. If cheerleading is not considered a sport, than they will never get a set of rules that could prevent the from being injured.]]>

The Bases need to be strong enough to hold their weight over their head and support them while they carry out the routines. The flyers cant mess up with their gymnastics or the whole routine is messed up. Cheering is like football. When at competetion it all comes down to who doesnt mess up and who follows through with the whole routine. In football it comes down to who got the ball over the goal. With every move made you get points added on or taken off just like how in any other sport you gain points as the game progresses.

Reason why I think I this is because to be a cheerleader you have to train or be skilled for it just like any other football, basketball, or soccer player. Being a cheerleader isn't as easy as it seems. Many cheerleaders have gotten injured in the past century by doing leaps, jumps, stunts like pyramid building, and tossing athletes in the air. These things are dangerous because you have to have strong partners at the bottom ready to help catch you. Their have been some court cases about cheerleading not being a sport. For example the 2010 court case in Connecticut. This court case ruled that cheerleading was not a sport ( Biediger v. Quinnipac Universaity ). Before cheerleading could be defined a real sport it would have to have a better set of rules and a better orangization. In my opinion cheerleading isn't any different than any other sports. Cheerleading has coaches, practices, competitions, and a governing organization. Some important information about cheerleading is that many famous cheerleaders have had a big impact in the U.S. Such as President George W. Bush who served as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy of Minnesota in Andover, Massachusetts during his senior year of high school. More information about cheerleading is that cheerleading was invented by a male student at the University of Minasota in 1878 ( website of international cheer organization ) . And that is why I think cheerleading is an actual sport.]]>

The dictionary states an athlete as,&quot; a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Physical strength, agility, and stamina is all associated with endurance. Without endurance, you cannot become a cheerleader. Also, the American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries states,&quot; ... cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity...&quot; Cheerleading is a very physical demanding sport, and how can a cheerleader be physically demanding if they don't have endurance? Endurance is required in every physical sport, and cheerleading runs on endurance. Furthermore, any type of sport also runs on competing. According to Title IX regulations,&quot;... a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal must be to compete.&quot; Cheerleading is just as equally competitive as any other sport. Also, the director of a competitive cheerleading pragram says,&quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing.&quot; Cheerleading has become an independent sport; Instead of supporting other sports, it competes on its own.]]>

Cheerleading is just as physically demanding as any other sport. Many compare cheerleading to gymnastics. They are very similar. For example, American Academy of Pediatrics says, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast paced floor rountines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; As it says in this quote cheerleading is a hard sport to pull of. After a full rountine you will be out of breathe, between the jumping, flipping, and lifting. It is a workout! The dictonary defines an athlete as, &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excersices, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Many cheerleaders are not considered as athletes even though they consider themselves as athletes,and this definition defines many or all who participate in cheerleading because you need physical strenth to lift other teammates during stunts, agility and stamina to make it through a rountine and all the flips and tricks they preform. It is evident that cheerleading is a sport because it is physically demanding. A growing problem with this sport is that it is not subject to rules and regulations like many other sports.Many participates get hurt.]]>

Cheerleading has eveloved into a much different sport than it was before. The director if a competitive cheerleading program agrees in saying, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; If cheerleaders posess all these skills, it should be considered a sport and the people participating should be considered athletes. The definition of athlete is, &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleaders all posess these traits, and should be henceforth deemed athletes. Additionally, cheerleading should be designated as a sport because when it is not, cheerleaders can experience health and legal battles. In the American Academy of Pediatrics report of cheerleading injuries, they say, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies... and school athletic departments.&quot; This proves that by not classifying cheerleading as a sport, it is causing major difficulties to those involved. Imagine putting all this time and energy into a sport and conditioning for months for a competition. The dificulty required to form a human pyramid is tremendous! Therefore, cheerleading should be classified as a sport.]]>

Cheerleaders also have to be confident on what they are doin because if there not there is a big posibility that they will mess up and get hurt.Some people believe that cheerleading is easy well let them try it and find out how much work it takes and confidence not only on your self but also on your team mates. Alot of people get hurt while cheerleading but when they really love the sport of cheerleading no matter what happens they will come back and keep trying. Cheerleading is a little like dancing you got to have balance,strengh,confidence and more but most importantly they have got to trust there team mates.]]>

A cheerleader needs to have strength, flexibility and grace. They need strength to lift their cheerleading mates up, they need flexibility to keep jumping around and do difficult actions, and grace to look happy during their performances. As cheerleading progressed, it became more competitive and competitive, just like other sports. Other sports started off as leisurely activities, and became more and more competitive, with some kind of prize. Cheerleading started off when male students believed they should have &quot;yell leaders&quot; to help performance of their sports teams. It was controlled by the pep club. Now, the cheerleading teams are controlled by the schools athletic department. They have coaches, practices, and competitions to attend. Therefore, I believe that cheerleading is a legitimate sport.]]>

Another reason why cheerleading should be a legitamate sport is because it has as much or maybe even more injuries than other sports. The exciting and beautiful stints they do are very risky and dangerous. In fact, over the years the stunts cheerleader have been doing have evovled into crazier more exotic stunts. A quote from the students notes are, &quot; American academy of pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries- &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forh by sports governing bodies... and school athletic departments.&quot;]]>

This goes to show that you need to physical ability to be able to pick people up when doing shows at halftime or onthe sidelines for sports. Another reason is that the American Academy of Pediatrics report that, &quot;cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set by sports governing bodies and school departments. A sport has to compete in tournaments to be a sport. It is said that for somthing to be onsidered a sport it whas to have a coach, have practices, and be able to compete in competitions. Cheerleading does compete in competitions and haver practices but is not being turned into a sport. Also cheerleading has camps you can go to to get better. Also cheerleading has sponsors so they can maek money. If cheerleading wasnt a sport why wouldit have sponsors?]]>

Former pressident Geroge .W. Bush cheerleadt. People who say cheerleading is easy thats wrong also. You need upper body strengh and you need to be fliexable. Also cheerleading can lead to concusions and broken bones. It is simaler to gymnastics. In fact cheerleading is just as hard as any other sport.The cheerleaders are out there in rain and shine cold and hot. Cheerleaders are also very entertaning.They do pep rallys and everything. They are loved by males also. In 2012 the US court of appreals said that cheerleading is a sport so there is no reason that highschools should be takeing that out as a sport. Cheerleading is just as hard as any other highschool sports. Well guys try to do a flip,handing and a split.Its a hard sport try it before you judje it guys! Can you hold up a woman can you do any of the things they do? Guys cheerleaders get bulliedfor what they do. Its not fair to them. Sports are hard even golf, you have to do math,soccer you have to run for 90 minutes. Football you have to out power the other guy and run. Baseball you need to be some what fast and have a strong arm. In water polo and swimming you have to swim so much and people judge the sport still, I bet you couldnt last a minute in that sport. And in Cheerleading you kinda have to do all of those sports before you judje.]]>

They must be able to do tumbling floor routines similar to the ones you would see in gymnastics. The director of a competitve cheerleading program said, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; I agree that girls and boys standing around at a football or basketball game cheering and shaking pompoms doesn't require much of anything, but cheerleading isn't about that as much anymore. It's more about competing, and actual competitive cheerleaders should start being considered as athletes.]]>

Your team has to have an organized routine, and most coaches contruct it with hard skills and good cheering. Not very many sports have all these aspects, a lot just have running, catching, and throwing, and hitting a ball. Cheering involves many different hard stunts, for example, if you are a flyer, you have to put your leg to your head, hold it there, then are dropped into a series of twists, flips, and turns that your bases have to catch and throw you up in the air during. A sport must have coaches, preactices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization: its main goal must be to compete, according to Title IX. Cheerleading obviously has all of these. My friends are cheerleaders and they practice all the time, and have a big competition each year. There is a national cheerleading organization, and they sponsor competitions, and camps for lots of cheerleaders. Like most other sports, cheerleading builds confidence, and knowledge. You learn teamwork and many other skills that you can use in your life. If you learn a new stunt, or a hard tumbling pass, cheerleading will make you feel proud of yourself. Cheerleading is definitely a sport!]]>

This shows that we are required to have strength and stamina to sustain in the same position for a long amount of time. Also, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, cheerleaders has grown a tremendous amount. They are now able to do more complex stunts and fast paced floor routines that contains leaps and jumps throughout the routines. This kind of activities needs the type of characteristics that an athlete needs to have to acheive the tricks without getting hurt. Cheerleaders should have the same respect as other athletes as they do contain all the characteristics that make up an athlete. Although cheerleding should be considered as a sport, we should make the sport better. According to the US courts of Appeals, cheerleding needs beeter organization and clear defined rules before it can be considered a real sport. This is true, but if the people would just consider cheerleading as a sport, maybe we would be able to improve it. Some famous people has been cheerleaders in the past as well, including George W. Bush. Cheerleader is just a recent sport and should be taken seriously because it requires competetive skills as well.]]>

It requires so much more effort today than ever before. It is also not so much about cheering for football and basketball teams. Its more about competeing.

In the definition for athlete it states that it is a person who is skilled or trained in, exercises, sports or games requiring physical strength. In the American Academy of Pediatrics report they sted it is physically demanding and in the definition of an athlete it states that it requiers physical strength which clearly cheerleading requires physical strength if it is physically demanding. The American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries states that &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies... and school athletic departments.&quot; The Title IX regulations requires universities to offer equal athletic opportunities to both men and women; under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal must be to compete. Cheerleading follows all of these regualtions that Title IX has. Therefore it shall be made a sport. Cheerleaders do many competitions, they have coaches and they also have many designated practices. Cheeleading does also offer both male and female opportunities. We see many times men doing cheerleading and on a squad with women so cheerleading does offer it.]]>

Cheerleading also is very organized and played like a sport since there are cheerleading groups and companies. And they also hold there own massive competitions. One example of this is the National cheerleading organization which sponsers regional and national events and championship competitions , they also have high school cheer camps ; and youth camps. So it is obvioues that cheerleading is a very organized sport but this seems to be in contradiction with the court ruling of Biediger v. Quinnipiac University which rules that cheerleading was not a sport. This ruling was made on the pretense that in order to be a sport , cheerleading would need to be more organized which it already is.]]>

As the dictionary states that an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, and stamina.&quot; To cheerleed, you normally have to life your teammates to create a human pyramid, and have to be flexible to perform stunts such as back handsprings. Although people don't believe that cheerleading is a sport, let's think about how much it progressed over the years. Although it originated as people shouting and screaming &quot;rah, rah&quot; to encourage their team to do better, it is now as competitive as any other real sport out there right now. As the director of the competitive cheerleading program said, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football or basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheerleading is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pomopoms.&quot;]]>

Cheerleading is in every football game, or so i think but all i can say it is a sport due to the dangers, athleticness, and accidents, i mean last year i saw a video of a basketball player who twisted his leg and his bone popped out of it, literally it was out of the skin, that can happen cheerleaders if they fall on their leg, you never know sports can be sometimes dangerous just ask athletes yourself and see what they say, so you see cheerleading is a sport, also its not for cheering for any teams anymore its actually for competing said the Director of a Competitive Cheerleading Program &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing.&quot;]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[First of all, cheer-leading is a rigorious activity. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style-tumbling, and complex stunts.&quot; Today, cheerleading is not just about motivating a football team anymore. It's now a legitimate sport in which athletes train themselves with hard and complex routines. A program which requires excellent agility, stamina, and physical strength deserves to be a sport. To again reference what the American Aacademy of Pediatrics reported, &quot;Chearleeding should be a designated sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies... and school athletic departments.&quot; This is due to the AAP board recognizing the jeopardy involved in cheerleading. They've recognized cheerleading is a sport because of the risks posed by stunts, &quot;such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; Cheerleading is physically rigorious and demanding, therefore it is a sport. Furthermore, cheerleading has competitions all over the globe. The national cheer organization sponsors regional and national competions and championship events. According to Title IX regulations, &quot;a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal must be to compete. Due to the very competetive nature of cheerleading, by the standards of Title IX regulations, cheerleading is a true sport. National contests are held all around the U.S.A., even small, regional ones. According to a director of a competitive cheerleading program, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; its about competing.&quot; The perspective of people involved in cheerleading tells us that cheerleading is inherently competetive. Since a sport's main goal must be to compete, and cheerleading is all about competition, cheerleading is a sport.]]>

Here's why I think cheerleading is a sport. Cheerleading have to be able to move their body and to also be able to have a loud voice. You need a loud voice to keep the football players going and to be able to cheer them on but you also need youre body to move to be able to get the football player's attention that they are cheering the team on. Cheerleading also requires flexibility in you're body. If you can't move around correctly, then how would a cheer;eader be able to get their teams attention and the crowds attention on them? You also need the strength to be a cheerleader. you needd to have a strong voice to get the crowd going. If you aren't flexible, or stong, or if you're not able to move you're body at all, then you can't be a cheerleader. Cheerleaders do almost as much work as a football player. So the fact that people are say that cheerleading is not a sport, is rediculous. It can tire you out!]]>

We have to hold up our teammates and create a human pyramid. Not many basketball or football players can do that. So why isn;t cheerleading just as much considered a sport as any other one. Just like all other sports cheerleaders have to train, cheerleaders compete and play to win. The American Academy of Pediatrics even says, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramtically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps....&quot; This shows how much we actually do. Many people believe that all cheerleaders do is yell and scream to get the crowd excited, yes that is what cheerleaders do but it's not what cheerleading is about. Cheerleading is about being athletic and very skilled. Teh definition of an athlete is &quot; a perso who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; This proves that cheerleasders are athletes, cheerleaders can't just get up one day and be able to do all of these amazing tricks and stunts. It takes practice. It takes just as much athleticism, strength, agility, and endurance as many high school sprts. So why wouldn't it be considered a sport?]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[It is obvious that cheerleading is a much debated topic when you raise the question of whether or not it is a true sport. Although most believe cheering is shaking pompoms with a dashing smile, it takes strength, agility, and great stamina to be a cheerleader. A director of a competitive cheerleading program states, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; It takes alot to be a cheerleader. You have to acquire a talent for gymnastics, you have to fit, healthy, and very strong, etc. The American Acadcemy of Pediactrics wrote a report on cheerleading injuries: &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; Cheerleaders and their teams also need to be just as well equipped for tournaments and games as your average football player. Title IX regulations &quot;require universities to offer equal athletic opportunities to both men and women; ...a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization.&quot; Cheering requires practices, games, uniforms, a coach, team members, etc. So does any football, basketball, or baseball team.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Without a doubt, cheerleading is a sport. Cheerleaders compete just like any other basketball, soccer, or football team. They must put in as much effort,hard work,and dedication as all other athletes. A director of a competitive cheerleading program once said, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah,rah' and shaking pom poms.&quot; The director of the cheerleading program has greatly explained how cheerleading is just as much of a sport as football and basketball. Surely, every cheerleader is an athlete. They have many practices, competitions, and events. The National Cheerleading Organization sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events. They also sponsor high school cheer camps and youth cheer camps. According to Title IX regualtions, &quot;Universities are required to offer equal athletic opportunities to both men and women. A sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; and its main goal must be to compete. Cheerleading isn't just a feminine sport because George W. Bush was a head cheerleader in his senior year of high school. Also, cheerleaders have coaches, practices, competitions, a governing organization, and the cheerleaders are competitive. Therefore, cheerleading passes the Title IX regulations and should be considered a sport.]]>

Cheerleading takes strength and staminia and flexibility. Over the last years cheerleading has evolved into a national compettive sport and should be considered as such. Also cheerleading does need more rules i can agree on that, but it should still be considered a sport for the sher amout of power you need to compete in it. If it was designated as a sport it would get more rules and regulations so to get rules declare it a sport. For all the cheering individuals out there know how hard it is to cheer.

However, there is so much more to cheerleading. Cheerleading definitly should be considered a sport, as it requires a lot of athletisism, can cause injuries, and is both a male and female hobby. Although this may surprise you, cheerleading is an activity where athletisism is required. According to the American Acadamy of Pediatrics, &quot;...cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity&quot;. If you are a cheerleader, you must be strong enough to hold up your teammates, and felxible enough to participate in the routines. Also, many injuries can be caused by cheerleading, so it is important that it is considered a sport. &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to the rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments&quot; (American Acadamy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries). Schools should classify cheerleading as a sport so that cheerleaders are under the same school regulations regarding injuries as other athletes. Lastly, cheerleading is typically thought of as an activity for girls, however boys have just as much interest! Believe it or not, but George W. Bush himself was the head cheerleader at his highschool! That is why cheerleading should be considered a sport.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[In order to be an athlete one has to be trained in sports requiring physical strength. Cheerleading demands all the above and more. For one to become a cheerleader, said person would have to be strong enough to hold an individual with their arms, and balanced enough to pull off certain stunts (back handsprings, high flyers, jumps, etc.). One also must have the energy to commit to all that, and to still have the required enthusiam to cheer for the team. An American Academy of Pediatrics cheerleading injury report states that &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitve, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes into the air.&quot; In that report the academy clearly claims that cheerleading is a sport because of its physical demands and the fact that the sport does have a year-round season. &quot;Cheerleading should be a designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; Quoted from another American Academy of Pediatrics report it explains the fact that cheer should be considered a sport, not only because of the athletisism required, but for the fact that it has met all the regulations needed and it should be recognized for it. The director of a competitive cheerleading program (and I too share this thought), has a belief that &quot;cheerleading isn't about the cheering for the football or basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more then yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Initially cheer was invented by a group of male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898. They were participating members of the Pep Club, and had elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crowd for the duration of the last game of their football team's season. Our past president George W. Bush, was head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, MA, in his senior year of highschool. Cheerleading has a history, but so do rules and regulations. The Title IX requires a sport to have: &quot;coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal must be to compete.&quot; Also under Title IX unversities must offer equal sport related opportunites to both women and men. Cheerleading follows through to each and every rule stated above. In the case Biediger v. Quinipiac University a court decision was made and read as the following: &quot;...ruled that cheerleading was not a sport, according to Title IX regulations; decision was upheld in 2012 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which stated that cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport.&quot; For someone whom is about to begin cheer I would say that the rules are pretty clear, but maybe for someone watching or just joining (without much background), it may need some working on. Other than that cheer is as much as a sport as football, soccer, basketball, or any other sport for that matter.]]>

Acorrding to the dictionary, an athlete is someone who is trained in games requiring strength, agility, and stamina. Cheerleading includes all of that and more. Our activities as cheerleaders require an exstensive amount of strength and flexibility ion order to do what we do. We must be able to be strong enough to lift our team mates, graciously pull off our tumbles, and act like a gymnist. Also, acorrding to the Title IX reguations, a sport must hold practices, have coaches, and be able to compete. This applies to cheerleading and everything that we do during our season. Cheerleading is not only about cheering but about the abilities of the athletes who preform during the competition. Many people, including many sports regulations, lead to the fact that cheerleading can be classified as a sport. It was even originally created in order to get the crowd excited for the game ahead but has quickly evolved into a very rigorous sport. The American Academy of Pediatrics even said that &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity.&quot; This just goes to show how dedicated a person must be to cheerleading just like with other sports as well.]]>

Cheerleaders have to to be trained to be able to lift their team mates in the air, throw them up high, and catch them before the land on the floor. Not only is it a sport but it is a difficult one, if you don't have enough physical strength then another team mate can get an injury. Cheerleading also follows the Title IX regulations, they allow both genders to cooperate in this activity, they have more than one coach on each team, practice is almost a daily thing, they have cheerleading competition through the summer and fall. Those are the requirements for it to be considered a sport and it passed them. Yes, Biediger v. Quinnipiac University- a 2010 district court case in Connecticut, ruled that cheerleading was not a sport, but they don't just cheer for the footbal and basketball players, they cheer because they love to compete. Both girls and boys who cheer have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football players. So if all of those are sports, why can't cheerleading be one.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[To begin with, cheeleading takes as much athleticism as any other sport. The dictionary definition of an athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. In cheerleading, you have to lift people, and to gymnastics like skills, such as a back handpring. That goes to show that we do practice to achieve physical strength, agility, and stamina. If gymnastics is a sport, then why can't cheerleading be one when it takes just as much and maybe even more athleticism than the next sport. American Academy of Pediatrics says that &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes into the air.&quot; As far as I am concerned, most sports involve most of those characteristics and some sports aren't even played all year round like cheerleading is. Cheerleading is very involved in athletics and if all of the characteristics listed don't constitute it as a sport, then I don't know what does. In 2010, a district court case in Connecticut stated that cheerleading was not a sport (according to Title IX regulations) because it needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport. Title IX regulations state that universities require universities to offer equal athletic opportunites to both men and women; under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal must be to compete. Cheerleading has all of those things. There are both male and female cheerleaderws, and although there are mostly female cheerleaders, take me for example. I am a male that it standing up for cheerleading to be a sport because I am a cheerleader (as girly as it may sound). As a matter of fact, cheerleading was created by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898 and former president George W. Bush served as head cheerleader in his senior year of high school. We have multiple coaches that teach and help us to perfect our craft year-round. Coaches are the source of how cheerleading happens and I don't know how it could be done so well without them. There are also multiple ractices every week, and every year we train for major competitions. Cheerleading is a well-developed organization and the main yearly goal is to compete. I don't see anything that doesn't qualify cheerleading to be a sport. As a final point, cheerleading takes a lot of work and practice to master. A cheerleader must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Without those qualities, cheerleading wouldn't be as developed as it is today. Sports such as football and gymnastics require much less skill than cheerleading does. In all honesty, I think that the only reasonthat people are going against cheerleading for it to not be a sport is because of bias thoughts or feelings. Cheerleading may seem like a girly sport, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't constitute as a sport. Overall, cheerleading is a true sport that takes much athleticism and practice.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Cheerleaders should definetly be declared a sport since it requires the same amount of athletic ablitities asfootball players and gymnists have. The definition of athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; These qualities are absolutly presented throughout a cheerleaders routeen or practice. For example, when a teamate has to lift someone up to make a human pyrimid, or they have to be flexible to do flips and round offs. For cheerleaders you need to be trained the routeens and have to be skilled at them to be a good cheerleader, and the words &quot;trained&quot; and &quot;skilled&quot; are in the definition of an athlete. Therefore, cheerleading should be declared a sport. Due to the cause of cheerleading's population increasing in the past, more and more injuries have accoured. It is because of the dedication and amount of practice that these particiopants put forth, that there have been injuries. In an American Academy of Prediatrics, there was a report on cheerleadind injuries. It stated, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into0 a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of flat-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastic-style tumbling, and complex stunts, auch as pyrimid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; This shows that cheerleading had now became a &quot;competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity&quot; that definitly fall under the requirements of a sport. UNder the TItle IX, it states that &quot;a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season and a governing orginization; its main goal must be to complete.&quot; The cheerleaders need to have a coach to show them their new routeens, they will need to have practices to perfect them, and they will have a season where they go to competitions and compete for medals. Cheerleading should absolutly be declared a sport. As you can tell, cheerleading is a true sport. From where it states it in the definition of an athlete, to under the Title IX, cheerleading is demenstrated as a sport. If you agree with me, take a stand and show the world what you believe in.]]>

With cheerleading they're almost the same thing; you still have to attend practice, compete in competitions, work to get better, risk getting hurt, and sometimes you have to put everything you've got into it. Cheerleading may look easy but it really takes time and lots of effort. It's hard learing/memorizing routines and not only that but you have to be brave and have enough confidence to go out in front of lots of people and preform. It has also been proven that cheerleading is not just yelling and jumping up and down but you actually have to do work and put in effort. cheerleading also has a combination of many sports. &quot;The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; This can be proven in many ways. If you search the definition of an athlete it will tell you, &quot;A person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; That definition basically describes a cheerleader.]]>

Cheerleading is a mixture of gymnastics, dance, and acrobatics. They must be able to perform tricks such as a back handspring layout that most people without the proper training can not attempt. They also have to have the strenght to lift someone up and balance the on sometimes only foot in their hands. Cheerleaders need agility, balance, flexibility, and strength to perform all of their moves. The injuries can be even worse than football injuries because in football, they dont have tro balance a 120 pound athlete in their hands, so they won't have to worry about that person plumeting into the ground. Cheerleading is also not something you can wake up one morning and decide to do. It takes two years of tumbling skills atleast if you are a fast learner. If cheerleading, an activity that requires extreme balance, strength and flexibilty, isn't a sport, then I don't know what is.]]>

An athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Take this into consideration for just a moment. I, along with mostly all other cheerleaders, consider myself an athlete. In fact, a cheerleader is an athlete. The definition states that the person must be trained or skilled and have the physical strength required. Well, a cheerleader calls for a lot of physical depends. Holding up a hundred and ten pound girl for 10-30 second is not easy. Throwing a person up 10 feet in the air, I can tell you that it is definitely a workout. With that, you can not just jeopordize someones health by chucking them in the air, or holding them up. There is a technique that must be followed. It requires an emmense amount of physical demands, and training hours upon training hours to perfect every cart wheel, flip, throw, and candlestick. Therefore, a cheerleader fits the criteria of an athlete, and every sports involves athletes.]]>

To pick up a person to create a human pyramid, lots of physical strength is required. Also cheerleading requires &quot;fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts such as tossing athletes in the air.&quot; (American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries) Cheerleading has become very competive as well. The National Cheerleading organization sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events that involve skill. Also their is many high school cheer camps and youth camps that help you become a cheerleader. Their wouldn't be camps and competitions if cheerleading wasn't a competive sport. Cheerleading isn't about cheering on a football team or a basketball team now its about competing. The cheerleaders compete to be the best they can be. The girls and boys who cheer have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[I think cheerleading is a sport because of all the lifting and jumping. Also an athlete is aperson that is trained or skilled in excersises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. So by the definition of an athlete cheerleading is a sport because they exercise and and require physical strength. Also, American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies and school athletic departments. In my opinion I think that cheerleading can be classified as a aport. No it may not be like other sports but it does have a lot of physiacl things just like sports. Also, it is not just a girl thing many guys do cheerleading. For example, former president George W. Bush served as a head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover,Massachusetts. Not all sports are the same. Compare dancing to playing football they are very different but they are still sports. Thats why cheerleading should be classified as a sport. Its not like soccer or basketball but has the same classifications as a sport.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Cheerleading is a true sport. I know this because in the article it says how, to be a cheerleader you would be considered an athlete right? Well here in the passage it says the definition of an athlete is, &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exersizes, sports, or games requiring phisical strength, agility, or stamina&quot;. Isn't that exactly what a football player is? Another reason why I feel that cheerleading is a true sport is because, in the passage it says that the Director of a competitive cheerleading program said that &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah rah rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; And I agree with him one hundred percent, because my friend is a cheerleader, and when ever I see her go to her practices, I always see her lifting up the people so they can do the stunts. And just like football or basketball, they are competing with other cheerleading teams accross the country. And trying to bring home the trophy. In conclusion, this is why I think that cheerleading is a true sport.]]>

If football is considered a sport, why cant cheerleading be considered a sport too? Usually if you play a sport like lacrosse or football or any other sport you are offered to go to a camp or any other event involving that sport. With cheerleading it's the samething, you get involved in &quot;sponsors regionals and nation competitons and championship events ; highschool cheer camps;youth camps&quot; (National cheerleading organization). If cheerleadiong has all those events that it is involve in, just like other sports then why are people considering that cheerleading isn't a sport?

Cheerleaders have to do the same amount of work or more than most athletes to complete their stunts and routines. A cheerleader may go from using the accuracy of a gymnast to do her flips to using the strength of a football player to throw her fellow teammate into the air. As you can see, cherleading requires many different dynamics of athleticism, so it should definitely be considered a sport. Others state that cheerleading can not be considered an official sport because it is not organized, but this too is incorrect. Cheerleading is actually quite organized, even more so than some other sports, and it meets all the law requirements for being a sport. It offers opportunities to participate to both men and women. There a plenty of cheerleading coaches and teams, as well as many cheerleading competitions. In the U.S., we even have a National Cheering Championship. As you can see, cheerleading is quite organized, so it deserves to be viewed as a real sport.]]>

The definition of an athlete supports the students claim because it says &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot;. Cheerleading requires strength, agility, and stamina. It requires that because they have to be able to balance on top of pyramids, hold each other up, and be able to do flips. That is why the definition of athlete supports the students claim in his introductory paragraph. The note about cheerleading injuries supports the introductory paragraph because i consider any physical activity that requires getting hurt a sport. Cheerleading is very dangerous and a hard sport to do. Not alot of peope are able to do those kinds of flips and hold people up like that.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[This student has a very strong claim to why cheerleading should be classified as a sport instead of just sreaming and yelling with pompoms. i think this because the student provided hard evidence and facts to what cheerleading involves such as complicated physical and verbal actions. The reasons why i think that cheerleading should deffinetley be classified as a sport is because cheerleaders are athletes. The word athlete doesnt mean heavy weight champion or something of the sort. The dictionary proved shows the propper definition of athlete which is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot;. The words that have been stated in this definition are exactly the type of characteristics it takes to be a cheerleader. My next reason is cheerleading can be just as competitive, complex, and physically demanding just like any other sport, maybe even more dangerous. Cartwheels and throwing a football or etc arent thet much different by far. Throwing a football still takes the same amount of energy it would take to do a cartwheel and still could end up in a bad injury, such as dislocation, sprain or etc. Not only that but, cheerleaders have competions that they have to go to just as much as people who play basketball,football or etc have games that they have to go to.Lastly, cheerleaders have to definetley be fit and in shape just like everyone who play other sports have to be, such as eating right, exercise and many other things that can help keep you healthy The last reson why i think that cheerleding should be classified as a sport is because is rquires skill just like any other sport. Cheerleaders have to be as graceful as a a dancer but as strong as a football player. For example, just like how basketball players,have to practice and practice to become very good at what they do is the same way cheerleders have to practice and practice to get things right and be good at what they do.]]>

An athletein the dictionary is,&quot; a person who is trained or skilled in excerises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot;. In cheerleading you have to have the physical strength to support someone in the air, the agility to be quick and fluent, and you have to have the stamina to be able to flip,yell, and hold someone throught out a routine. If cheerleaders are athletes that require all the these elements to one focus which are required in a sport, then why isnt cheerleading a legitimate sport? In sports there are many requirments such as i said before. But acoording to Title IX regulations,&quot;under Title IX,a sport must have coaches,pratices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal must be to compete.&quot;. In cheerleading there is all-star cheer which is organized by a nation cheer associtation, where you compete a competitions, and have pratices at least 3 times a week with coachs. If sports must have these requirments and cheerleading meets all of then why isnt it considered a sport? Besides that why dont we think about how dangerous sports are and the that they need rules to protected athletes. Think about cheerleaders throwing people in the air, and if they didnt catch them. But because cheerleading isnt a sports there isnt rule to protect them. Sources such as American Academy of Pediatrics believe cheerleading should be a sport. They say,&quot;Cheerleasding should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies... and school athletes departments.&quot;. With this being said we can gather that they believe that cheerleading should be a sport so that there are rules to protect people because of how dangerous it is, just like any other sport. As to other sports kick and throwing a ball, and cheerleading throwing people in the air.]]>

Cheerleading is a competitive sport too. You must be strong to lift other teammates and do flips in the air. Not everyone can do cheerleading. Flexibility is not a trait in everyone. There have been injuries reported that have been caused by cheerleading. It can become an intese sport. Many people think that cheerleading is for girls. Although, many boys participate in the sport. In 1898, cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota. Former US president George W. Bush actually was head cheerleader in his senior year of high school. It is easier for some men to do the heavy lifting, while the women do the gymastics. Boys and girls are a great way to have a good cheerleading squad.]]>

Reason 2 is &quot; Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; this supports his claim because it shows that cheerleaders get just as bad of injuries as football palyers or hocky players therefore Cheerleading should be considered as a sport just like football.]]>

The definition of an athlete is: &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excersises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility,or stamina.&quot; When you hear this, you automatically think of a basketball or football player. You don't nessescarily think of a cheerleader though. Cheerleaders are just as physically fit as any other athlete. They must as strong as a football player to lift eachother and bulid human pyramids. They must also be as flexible as a gymnast to do some of the moves needed to create a routine. Being a cheerleader requires the same abilities any other sport may have. It is also said that cheerleading isn't a sport because there aren't enough rules and regulations for it to qualify, and there must be practices, coaches, and competitions to compete. All of these things are a part of cheerleading though. There are practices to perfect the routines and coaches to keep the athletes in check. There are even competitions. There are regional and national competitions to compete and have the best routine. High school and youth camps are also provided to train these althletes hoping to become great cheerleaders someday. Cheerleading follows all the requirements for a regular sport.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[The first reason cheerleading should be seen as a serious sport is because of the fact it fits the rules and guidlines of Title 9. Title 9 states, &quot;a sport must have coaches, practices, compititions during a defined season, and governing an organization; its main goal must be to compete.&quot; When we first see cheerleaders, we automatically think of frail high school girls jumping around with pompoms at a football game. But little do people know, over the years cheerleading has been on the rise and is getting far more serious than every before. Title 9 states that a sport must have coaches? Even with standard high school cheerleading, there is still coaches directing the cheerers to stand and basic performances. They have pratices once or twice a week, which is also on Title 9's guideline for being a professional sport. Now a days, cheerleading compitions have begun not only against high school teams, but town and even state made teams competeing for a gold trophy, as any other sport. This too lives up to Title 9's expectation, that it's main goal should be to compete. Taking one step further, even with high school devision cheerleading squads, their main goal is to look better and preform better than other schools. That's a form of competeing too, is it not? A director of a competitive cheerleading program states, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah,rah,rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Another reason cheerleading should become an official sport is because cheering has much potential to become a big, successful sport- granted you give it the material it needs. Many cheerleading acts require strong physical activity, that almost bigger than a &quot;man's&quot; sport such as football or baseball. The American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries say, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; This shows that many cheerleaders but their heart and soul into routines, plans, and setups, just as baseball players train constantly, and football players make up their plays. Cheerleaders must keep their bodies in perfect condition to cheer all year round, not to mention have the muscle to lift other people!! The AAP also reports, &quot;Cheerleading should be a designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; The provers the fact that if you give cheerleaders the oppertunity and the right tools, they can really suprise you and engage you in an amazing sport.]]>

Another reason why cheerleading is also a real sport is because, they have to be as strong as a football player to lift up there friends in a human pyramid. They also have to have gymnest type moves when they're cheering, like doing backflips, flips, and more! Cheerleading isn't just about cheering on there team anymore, they go to competitions were they all battle against each other as they get judged for, crazy flips in the air to backflips on the ground and just plain cheering. Cheerleading was invented by MALE students at University of Minnesota in 1898, they were members of the pep clud and some were elected to be 'yell leaders' to get the football team pumped up before and during the game. Yeah, you might think Cheerleading was mostly Female dominite, but men created it. Some popular cheerleaders was a former president George W.

Cheerleading, like any other sport, requires the three traits above. Strengh is a very key part of being a cheerleader. According to, &quot;American Academy of Pediatrics,&quot; &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramamtically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisiting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics' style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; This article agrees that cheerleading should be designated as a sport so that it has the same rules and regualtion previously made. Also according to a director of a competitive cheerleading program, &quot;The girls and boys who cheeer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; Cheerleading requires all the strength, agility, and stamina that other sports like soccer and football do, so why do people refuse to aknowledge it as one? Cheerleaders also participate in competitions similar to bsketball players playing in AAU tournaments. These girls and boys must train tirelessly to build themselves up and be fit to compete. They also must successfully memorize any and all steps or routines. The sport of cheerleading is no easy task. It takes extreme strength to throw a human body 10 feet into the air. It takes great stamina to be able to take part in a 2 or 3 minute routine without break. And it takes agility to run all over a mat and be in your position on time. Cheerleading, like all sports, requires much from the athlete participating in it, and therefore should be considered a sport. Some may agree that cheerleading is not a sport because it doesn't have the right or enough regulations. In 2010 there was a court case in Connecticut that ruled cheerleading not a sport because of Title IX regulations. The IX regulations require athletics oppurtunities open to both men and women, coaches, practices, and compettiitons during the season. A higher court also came to the same decision stating that cheerleading needed better organizations and clearer rules before it could be a sport. This is a lame excuse not to consider cheerleading a sport simply because this is an easy fix. In order for cheerleading to be officially considered a sport all that must be done are better organizations need to be established and more clear regulations and rules for the sport set up. Cheerleading already is a sport meeting the strength, agility, and stamina requirements that many other sports need. With the setting up of rules, regulations, organizations,and competitions then cheerleading will have to be a sport even in the eyes of those that refuse to aknowledge it.]]>

Just sitting around and watching TV all day means you're lazy andyou don't want to do anything else. The more you sit, the BIGGER you get! you'll also need to eat healthy snacks to keep you in shape. You don't want to eat food that is fattning.]]>

The definition of athlete is; &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. When cheerleaders perform their cheers, they are using their strength to pick their teamates up, stamina to dance, and flexibilty to do flips and twists. Who else thinks cheerleading is a sport? The American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading inquiries states- &quot;Cheerleading should designated as a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sport governing bodies and school athletic departments.&quot; Also, the director of a competitive cheerleading program states; &quot; Cheerleading isn;t about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The gils and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Cheerleaders are capable of anything that other sports players are capable of, and cheerleading should be considered a sport.]]>

His claims are correct because for other sports you do need strength and other sports you need agility. For cheerleading you need both to be able to do cheerleading.The writer is also claiming that they need as much strength as football players but the football players need more strength so they do so they cant claim it.The cheerleaders need strength but nowhere to as close as to football players.]]>

Why would anyone think cheerleading isn't a sport? Is it because people judge them as girls and guys who just get tossed in the air and sing a cheer? I think that thats a little bit unfair. Even though cheerleading might look easy to some people, it is actually very difficult. It takes a high level of skill and practice to become apart of a team or &quot;sqad&quot;. Many people think that cheerleading is just something girls do. It's not. It's unisex. I don't quite understand why a guy shouldn't be able to be a cheerleader as if it was soccer or basketball. Sure, each sport is different. They have different rules and different instructions. But when it all comes down to practicing that sport, it might be similar to the practices for cheerleading as well.]]>

In the group of cheerleaders they all have to be able to be on task.For example they would have to be well-balenced becasue if they cant keep track of two or more different tasks then they will not be ready to try thier best in what they want to do. Another reason I say this is because they have to be able to have practices and compete and not just go cheer for your school team.

There are leaps and jumps, tumblong and very hard and complicatde stunts. One example is the pyramid and throwing atheletes in the air. The Title IX regulations state tat the sport must have a coach, along with practicing and they have to compete with others. A director of a competitive cheerleading program said that &quot;Cheerleadign isnt about cheering for football and basketball teams anymore; its about competeing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah rah rah' and shaking pompoms.This shows that cheerleading has a lot of the characteristics of being a sport. In 2010 in Connecticut the court ruled that cheerleading is not a sport, and in 2012 was ruled that it was anot a sport agian but could be if there was better organization and clearer rules needed to be placed. George W. Bush was a head cheerleader for Phillips Academy in Massachusetts, during his senior year. The National Cheerleading organization sponsors both regonal and national competitions. This shows that the &quot;sport' is growing and is almost an offical sport.]]>

So thatv tells to show that cheer leading is a true sport. Cheering needs all of those physical needs to really be a real cheerleader. As a cheerleader you have to be as strong as a football player to lift your team mates to create a human pyramid thats one physical need a cheerleader has that another what people call a true sport needs. They also need to be flexible as any gymnast to perform stunts like a back or front hand spring. cheer leading requires as much athleticism, agility, endurance, and strength as any other high school sports. Former president George W. Bush served as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, during his senior year of high school. This shows that any male or female can do the true sport of cheerleading. If George W. Bush didnt think cheerleading was a true sport why did he do it, why not football, soccer, baseball, or lacrosse none of those he chose cheerleading. So this question why did he choose cheerleading over any thing else tells that cheerleading is a true sport in famous males lifes such as George W. Bush. Theres the National Basketball Association the &quot;NBA&quot;, the National Football League &quot;NFL&quot;, and also the National Baseball League &quot;NBL&quot;. Nobody knows about the National Cheerleading Organization? The national cheerleading organization sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events, such as high school cheer camps and youth camps. this organization is unlike any others, this organization has all the abilities to do what any other organization, leage, associations does and more. so if the NBA, NBL, or the NFL have leages, organizations, or associations they are all true sports.]]>

In the text it states &quot; Cheerleading requires just as much athlethicism, strength, agility, and endurance as many high school sports.&quot; Which proves that cheerleading is a sport. Also cheerleading is more than yelling, holding pompoms or doing a simple cheer. Cheerleading involves with stunts like making a pyrimad out of 6 people, throwing other athletes in the air, and doing many handsprings, cartwheels, ect. cheerleading is also a competition with other cheerleaders. Cheerleading is more of sport than any other with its stunts, grace, and strength.]]>

Some people say that cheerleading is not a sport for many reasons. One being that it is not competitive. Even though it is not competitive, I believe that it is a sport. If you would want to cheerlead you would have to have the strength of a football player, the flexibilty of a gymnist to perform stunts, and the grace of a dancer. Altogether this is a very demanding job that takes time to practice like any other sport you would play to get better.In the definition of an athlete, it explains that it is a person who is trained or skilled in excercises, sports or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. This definition highlights the fact that cheerleading is a sport because it says they have to be trained or skilled in excersices that require srength, agility, or stamina. These requirements appear in cheerleading in every section and that is why is should be declared a sport. Over the years cheerleading has changed from shaking your pom poms and yelling incouraging verses to competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity. People will frequently get hurt from sprained knees to broken ankles and this cannot happen anymore. American Academy of Pedriatics reports that cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies and school athletic departments. People have to realize that this sport is not one that you can easily acheive without injuries for the whole year. This problem has to be adressed soon or people will be seriously injured.]]>

It consists of jumps, leaps, tumbling, stunts, and tossing others in the air. All of these activities require either flexibility, strength, or balance. These three abilities are incorporated in other sports as well, such as gymnastics and football. Cheerleaders go through rigorous workouts and training to perform perfectly.They become injured at times and work until they're absolutely tired. Doesn't this sound like practicing for any sport? Title IX regulations say that a sport must have competitions to be a sport. Cheerleading meets this exact regulation. Their main goal at the end of the season is to compete with their routines they've practiced all year. They go up against hundreds of other cheer teams to decide who is the best and deserves first. Just like soccer, basketball, or track, there is always a winner and a loser at the end of the competition. A sport should be open to any citizen whether they're male, female, young, or old. Cheerleading gives equal opportunities to each of these people. Any school or university allows any student to play other sports, and so does cheerleading. You may not believe this, but just as many men cheer as women. What they all have in common is that they enjoy the sport and work their hardest to be the best at it. I'd say that sounds like playing a sport to me.]]>

Quinnipiac University, a case which argued that cheerleading was not a sport, there are many other things to bring up. The definition of an athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. No one can argue that a cheerleader fits that description because they do exercises that require physical strength, agility, and stamina all the time. To stregthen my case, under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing orginization; its main goal must be to compete. A director of a cheerleading program explained, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; A report in cheerleading injuries from the American Academy of Pediatrics stated, &quot;Cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competative, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jump, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot;]]>

Cheerleaders need to undergo these training exercises in order to pick up there fellow team mates, preform a routine with speed, and to be able to preform flips. These are just the basics of cheerleading, many cheerleaders have very strong legs and can preform excellently in other sports such as track and swimming. So, many who believe cheer leading isn't a sport are sadly mistaken because these cheerleaders undergo serious training and can do outstanding things. Secondly, Cheerleading has history just like every other sport. Cheerleading was created by male students atthe University of Minnesota in 1998. President George W. Bush was the head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, could you believe that a President of America saw that cheerleading was a sport just like any other. Many do not know that our nation has created so many great sports, however some refuse to accept them such as cheerleading. Though many of our leaders believed they were.]]>

If you ask people on the street if cheerleading is considered a sport, many of them would say no, and that chearleaders are not athletes. Even so, the dictionary states that an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical stregth, agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleaders are skilled in tumbling, much like gymnasts. Just by this one point is a cheerleader qualified as an athlete because tumbling requires physical strength, agility, and stamina, but there are many more aspects as well. According to a report done by the American Academy of Pediatrics, because of the vast evolvment of cheering into a competetive sport, it should be qualified as one. It is no longer just about cheering on football players now; there is a winner and a loser. Because of this competetive edge, these girls and boys are willing to push their bodies to the limits. The American Academy of Pediatrics reported that &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to the rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; Many injuries occur with cheerleaders; schools and the state should be held accountable. The 2010 district court case Biediger v. Quinnipiac ruled cheerleading not a sport becuase it did not fall under Title 9 regulations. It was not a competitive sport nor did cheering have competions, so universities were not required to give equal athletic opportunities.]]>

We have competitions,we have scheduled practices, we have a coach, were all highly trained,we all have physical strength,agility, and stamina. We are all athletes we fit the definition for one. People think cheerleading is just some stupid thing we do for fun. Its not its much more than that. Do you know how many cheerleaders strain their bodies to do stunts thats nearly impossible?

However, this is an unfair opinion; cheerleaders work just as hard as football players, gymnasts, dancers, and other athletes. Many cheerleaders, coaches, and athletes would agree that cheeerleaders fit the definition of athlete: &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleaders have to be trained all forms of fitness, from upper body strength to coordination to synchronization, as it is needed to perform the many stunts and excercises during a game. These same people believe that cheerleading is not a sport because they don't feel that is is physcially demanding enough, or that it doesn't really require the cheerleaders to work and hone heir skills. This is not the case, however, and as the American Academy of Pediatrics put it: &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evovled dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisiting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts...&quot; This report on cheerleading clears up the confusion and arguments very simply by stating that cheerleading in the present time is a sport that requires very much physically of its practitioners, and that the cheereaders deserve the same amount of respect as any other athlete.]]>

The girls and boys who cheer must have skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; In other words, cheerleading isn't just a simple task that people do, it requires skills and effort just like any other sports there is. In fact, from a reliable source the definition of an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Just like any other sport, cheerleading requires ethics and determination that only a sport will give you.

In a report on cheerleading injuries, the American Academy of Pediatrics states, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast paced floor routines whith leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing other athletes into the air.&quot; This shows that cheerleading needs as much physical strength and mental composure as many other sports do. Cheerleading is also a sport because it is a real competition, not just cheering on the teams. A director of a competitive cheerleading program stated, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheerleading is more than shaking pompoms.&quot; This explains that cheerleaders don't only cheer on teams, they compete with eachother, using many different skills.]]>

Cheerleaders must lift their fellow team mats into the air, as well as catching and throwig them depending on the routine. One must also have lots of stamina and agility to do complex movements for a long period of time. Cheerleading is extremely competitive and physically demanding. It's not just some fun thing people do to cheer for sports teams anymore, it's a hgih demanding sport that requires many, many things of a person in order for them to compete in it. With the fast paced floor routines, leaps, jumps, gymnastic-style tumbling and extreme stunts, cheerleading is very high demanding. One might even say that it's more demanding than sports. If cheerleading isn't a sport, then what is it? Under the Title IX regulations it states, &quot;a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing orgnization; its main goal must be to compete.&quot; Cheerleading has all of that and more, if cheerleading isn't considered a sport, then I'm not so sure what a sport is because based on that quote, cheerleading is a sport.

Cheerleading is more than just the hoo hah,&quot;if they can't do it, no one can!&quot;, and pom poms. Cheerleading requires team work, and coordination, grace, agilty, and stamina. To be able to go from a human pyramid, to a cartwheel preformance in under two minutes, is a very hard thing to do. You must dissassemble the pyramid, and there is about 12 cheerleaders in that. To get them all down, and hold the pyramid position, cheerleaders must have a lot of strength, agility, and stamina. They are trained to do so. This clearly fits the dictionary's definition of an athlete. Furthermore, Title IX regulations state that &quot;Universites require athletic opporitunites to both genders, and a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during seasons, and a governing organization; Its main goal is to compete.&quot; Cheerleadin g has many coaches. Cheerleaders require physical trainers, and managers. Cheerleaders have lots of practice in order to do the things that they do. It's really hard to form a human pyramid, and stay in that position without wobbling, without any physical practice. Cheerleaders must run, jump, preform acrobatic skills, and talk with enough compassion, and all that requires a big set of lungs/stamina. Cheerleading is definitely a sport, because of these reasons.]]>

For example Gymnastics is considered a sport and cheerleaders need to be as felxible as gymnastic people to do back hand stands, handsprings, and etc so it's the same as gymnastic just that cheerleading you also have to yell. Many Cheerleader's have been hurt according to American Academy Of Pediarics report, there's many ways cheerleaders get hurt for example falling off a human pyramid, being tossed in the air and not cathcing the girl, the can also sprain their back for doing handsprings. Cheerleaders do many complex stunts and tricks that you see in gymnastics. Also according to the director of a competitive cheerleading program it ststaes &quot;the gilrs and boys who cheer MUST have the SKILS of a GYMNAST.&quot; this shows that to be a cheerleader you Must have the skills of a gymnast and/or have to learn them to be a cheerleader. If gymnastics is considered a sport then cheerleading should be considered one too because cheerleaders are as or more flexible than gymnastic people and have/need the same skills.. Cheerleading should also be considered a sport because cheerleaders need to have physical strength which many sports require like football. Also cheerleaders have many competitions like football players have games. Cheerleaders need to have physical strength because they need to carry each other, throw each other in the air and catch her'him. cheerleaders do complex stunts that requires physical strength. According to title IX it states &quot;A sport must have coaches, Practices, Competitions during a season, and a governing organization; its main goal is to compete.&quot; This illustrates how Cheerleading should be a sport because cheerleading requires practice, we also have a coach to teach us new stunts, and cheers. We also have competitions during a season, we have governing organization, and our main goal is to compete. We have all the critiria that is required to be sport. Not only do we have the critiria but in cheerleading you add skills that are needed in other sport for example football. For example when you throw the ball you have to throw it to the other person , so when we throw our flyer in the air it's like we're throwing a ball. Also we need the stremgth to catch them again and thrown them high enough like they need strength to not get tackled.]]>

The dictionary says athlete:&quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exersizes, sports, or games requiering physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Being a cheerleader meets all of these traits. Another reason why cheerleading should be a sport is because cheerleaders put as much work in as a regular athelete does. For example, the directioner of a competitve cheerleading program said,&quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; its about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah' 'rah' rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot;]]>

Which just like many other sports you have to have time and effort if you want to show that you truly want to do that. Secondly it mentions how over the years that Cheerleading has become a very fun, hardworking activity that some people love to participate in. It has also started to require somewhat strength and agility which is key in almost any sport. The sport/activity also has its own league and championship.

Cheerleading is one of the hardest sports there is. The first reason being you have to be very athletic, Dictonary- athlete: a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games rquiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. Cheerleaders are very strong, they lift each other off the ground and up to 40 feet in the air! Also they build pyramids with each other! I don't know about you but that requires a lot of weight lifting in order to do that! Another reason why being athletic is key to being a cheerleader is because you have to be very flexible and agile to do all sorts of leaps, twirls and jumps in the air. According to the american academy of pediatrics over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramativally into a competitive, phsically demanding, year round activity consisting of fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastic style tumbling, and cmplex stunts. Cheerleading is probably one of the most altheltic and hardest sport that I know and from all of the evidence that I have found most people think so too.]]>

Without cheerleading being classified as a sport, there are no rules and regulations that are set by sport governing bodies and the athletic department of schools. &quot;A 2010 district court case in Connecticut, which ruled that cheerleading is not a sport, according to title IX regulations; decision was upheld in 2012 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which stated that cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport.&quot; (Biediger v. Quinnipiac University) Cheerleading even has its own organization and camps similar to how they train at other sports camps like football camp or baseball camp (&quot; National cheerleading organization- sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events; high school cheer camps; youth camps.&quot;) As well as needing rules, people often misread what cheerleading is. Most people see it as yelling and shaking pom poms, but thats not what its about anymore. Many cheerleading teams cheer for competitions. To qualify you need &quot;the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; Why would you need all of that to just shake pom poms?]]>

Cheerleaders get injured like any other sports player, they just have to work through it. Why do people call cheerleading a non-sport? I beleive that cheerleading sure has proven itself to be a very big and athletic sport. &quot;Cheerleading isnt about cheering for a football team anymore, its about competeing. The boys and girls must have skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Competitons are intese just like a football, laccrosse, soccor game, or ect... is. In these competions you do your best and fight to get that 1st place trophie. In dance, dancers are known for getting injueries and just danceing through the pain. Same with Cheerleaders. On theses competion teams if you have a twisted ankle they still tell you to get on that mat and do the routine. This is a phisically demanding sport. There is leaps, jumps, gymnastic-style tumbling, stunts with girls getting tossed in the air. There is always someone bound to get an injury. Overall, i believe that cheerleading should be counted as a sport. I have personal experience with cheerleading and know how hard it can get.]]>

Cheerleading is a lot harder than it seems to be. The director of a competitve cheerleading program states that: &quot;Chearleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Cheerleaders deserve to be called athletes. Many individuals agree that cheerleading should be designated as a sport. The Title IX regulations state that if an activity should be named a sport, it must have coaches, practices, competitions during a season, and a government organization. Cheerleading contains all of these requirements! Our coaches teach us new routines and help us with our tecnique. We practice on a daily basis. The national cheerleading organization sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events. Obviously, we compete in a wide variety of competitions. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies (...) and school athletic departments.&quot; There is no reason that cheerleading should not be called a sport since it encompasses the skills and rules that other sports contain.]]>

You are trained by learning cheers and stunts in which require you to be strong and fast. Also, as a cheerleader you're a lot like a gymnast. You have to be just as flexible and the stunts that you do are very similar to the ones that they do in gymnastics. Although some may say that cheerleading doesn't have good organization and needs clear rules (Title IX Regulations); cheerleadin meets the requirments to be a sport, each team has a coach, practices, competitions, and a governing organization. Therefore, cheerleading should be considered as a sport because the athletes that are in it all contribute the same amount of effort and dedication as any other individual who plays a sport. Another reason why cheerleading should be a sport is because it is very popular. Even former president, George Bush was a cheerleader back in his last year of high school. Also, the director of a competitive cheerleading program states the following, &quot;...it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheerleading is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pom poms.&quot; So the fact that cheerleading is said to not be a sport is absurd. Just the fact that you have to have the skills that other athletes have in at least three other sports should tell you that cheerleading is most definetly a real sport. Moreover, cheerleading is a sport because as a cheerleader, you have to have the same characteristics as any other athlete does.]]>

It started as a little pep talk for the sports teams, now, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, &quot;Over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competative, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; This shows how an activity that happened to cheer on sports teams has almost become its own sports team by its self, with all of the jumps and tumbling involved in it. Cheerleading now is about people with lots of physical strength practicing for competition, like other sports. According to the Director of a competative cheerleading program, &quot;Cheerleading isnt about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore, it's about competing.

Most of the controversy surrounding cheerleading has to do with it not being competitive. In the Title IX regulations it states that the main goal of an activity has to be to compete or else it does not qualify as a sport. Cheerleading may not have been considered a sport years ago, but it has changed since then. Cheering is more than just cheering on highschool sports teams. It now has many more aspects too it, including competion. Another aspect that cheerleading has now is stunts. 100 years ago, it may have just been yelling, but now, cheerleading involves stunts which require flexible athletes. Back handsprings, kartweels, and tumbling are just a few of the activities performed. If gymnastics is considered a sport (and has most of the same aspects) then gymnastics should be too! Football, basketball, baseball, and soccer are all sports that require strenght and endurance. Cheerleading is not all that different! This activity has become physically demanding over the years, invoving leaps, jumps, and complex stunts. Cheerleading also consists of pyramid building and tossing athletes into the air! If you ask me, that requires more strenght than throwing a football to a teammate!]]>

Cheerleading is not about cheering the football team anymore. There are now championships just for cheerleading. It doesn't just consist of pyramids and pom poms, it consists of floor routines and other gymnastic moves. The stereotype that cheerleading is for girls is also false. In 1898 this sport was invented not by a girl, but by a man. Many famous men have been cheerleaders. Among them former president George W. Bush in his senoir year at his high school. President Bush was not only on the squad, but the head cheerleader aswell.]]>

Also, just like other sports, you are working together against another team. &quot;...and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; This exemplifies the teamwork you need in order to complete the stunts. Cheerleading is and should be a sport because it is just like other sports where they comepete in different things while having to work together to win. Some people argue that cheerleading is not a sport because its just cheering teams on. That statement is actually incorrect because the cheerleaders do alot more than that. They do flips and tricks that are dangerous and they also need to be strong. Cheerleading isn't about wanting to cheer tames on anymore. &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football team anymore.&quot; This shows how they arent all about pep.

In my eyes a cheerleade is just a pretty girl in highschool who has a high self confidence issue and is the schools &quot;popular girl&quot; with all the friends and the group of people she hangs out with. Cheerleading isn't an actual sport and if you think they're athletes look at my statement's again then go open a dictionary, find the word &quot;athlete&quot; then tell me if a cheerleader meets thoes requirements. Also in the state of Connecticut in the year 2010 Biediger v. Quinnipiac University had ruled that cheerleading was NOT a sport. That's enough proof for me to know that cheerleading is not a sport who ever thinks other wise better read a book or two and pick up a few dictionarys and read the definition of the word sport to give themself a reality check. Cheerleading will never be considered a sport to me it may be a confidence booster during the actual spor they're cheering at. But cheerleading alone can't be a sport it's not even &quot;sporty&quot; to qualify as a sport all it is, is yelling, shouting, screaming and flipping. Cheerleading is just not a sport and it never will be.]]>

Every single day we go to cheerleading practice, we immediately lift weights for twenty minutes. When you see chearleeding squads perform high-flying stunts, it takes a lot of muscle to throw those people that far up into the air, so we have to be prepared to perform. Along with that, it takes lots of hard work and practice to balance a person perfectly during a human pyramid. You also need to have good back muscles to make sure you don't collapse. You have to have just as much strength in cheerleading as you do in other courts, or else your cheer team won't make the stunts, and then you have failed. For all those neysayers thinking that cheerleading isn't a sport, just look at the collegiate level rules and regulations. The Title IX regulations require universities to offer equal athletic opportunites for both men and women, and under Title IX, for an activity to be classified as a sport, it must have coaches, practices, and competitions during a defined season, and also must command a governing organization. And of course, it's main goal must be to compete and win its events. If we look at the details of Title IX and then compare them to cheerleading, cheerleading should be considered a sport. Every team has a coach who schedules practices, and we also have regional and national competitions sponsered by the NCLO, or the National Cheerleading Organization. We perform during football season, while some teams also perfrom at basketball games and throughout that sports season. Every town/cities athletic department sponsors them and gives them uniforms, and every team that competes in those competitions gives 100 percent effort to win. So yes, cheerleading is a sport.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[First and Foremost, cheerleading is a true sport because of the defintion of an athlete and Title IX regulations in the 2010 district court case &quot; Biediger v. Quinnnipac University.&quot; In the dictionary, the given definition goes as follows, &quot; a person who is trained or skilled in excercises, sports, or games requiring strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleaders must be as strong as a football player to be able to lift their fellow teammates up and be able to hold them in a pyramid. They must also have stamina becasue even if they do not want to, they must jump and do flips and such and have a lot of energy for the routine. If being a cheerleader matches the defintion of being an athlete, how come it is not considered a sport? The answer is quite simple; it should be! Pursuing this further, in the district court case &quot;Biediger v. Quinnipiac University&quot; the decision was clear, as Title IX states, &quot;.. require universities to offer equal athletic oppurtuinties to both men and women; a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal must be to compete.&quot; Cheerleaders do have a coach, and they surely do need one to help out with their practices which is for their competions. According to a director of a competitive cheerleading program,&quot; Cheerleadiing isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strangth of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling ' rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Cheerleading has changed a lot over the years and now is the time to acknowledge it for what it really is; a sport. Furthermore, males have made their apperance in cheerleading over the years. For example, one famous cheerleader that we should all know pretty well is former president George W. Bush. He was the head cheerleader during his senior year of high school at Philllips Academy in Andover Massachussetts. If Bush was The Head Cheerleader in his days, and he grew up to be a great president, then cheerleading should be taken a lot more seriously than it is now. Also, according to a website of a international cheer organization, cheerleading was invented by males at the University of Minnesota in 1898. It states that &quot; members of the 'pep club' elected 'yell leaders' to engage the crowd during the football's team last game of the season.&quot; Every other sport was most likely invented by men, and just because men did not carry the sport out to today, -like basketball or football- due to its lack of manliness, does not mean that it is not a sport. Cheerleading should be taken seriously and declared a sport because it should not be forgotten.]]>

That would basically will requierd to go to the gym every day or atleast 4-5 days each week. Also the more you exercise or lift up weights or humans, the stronger you will get. So if your strong as a football player it's mostly like a sport cause your strong. This is only the begining to be a cheerleader Another way to know how to be a debate cheerleading would be that you have to be flexible as a gymnast so that you could perform as a stunt when your doing a back handsprings. It really hard to do a back handsprings if your not flexible. Also you dont only need to be flexible just so you could do a hand backsprings, you also will need to do a split. But the American Academy of Pediatrics say that their has been many cheerleading injuries over the last century. Also it says that their is cheerleading that has evolved dramatically into a competitive and phisically demanding. The American Academy of Pedricts reported that cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies and school atheletic department.]]>

An athlete is a person trains or works out for a specific sport or game requiring physical movement. Technaly cheerleading is sport because it requires physical movement and training. Also cheerleading can be a sport because what I found out was that a Director of a competitive cheerleading program said &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, the strength of a football player. Cheering is more then yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; This is why I think that cheerleading is a sport.]]>

To br a cheerleader the girls have to be very strong, like a football player (Director of a competitive chearleading program). What this means is that event though the girls dont look very strong they have to be so that they could lift there teamates high into the air, throw, and catch them with eligance and grace. When football plsyers are playing they dont have to worry about being gracefull they just want to win, but with cheerleaders they need to do heavy lifting while looking pretty while doing it. The deffinition of an athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exersize, sport, sports, or games that requires physical strength, ability, and stamina. With that stead a chearleader has to be all of those thinks to be able to put on a good show. And with being an athlete that means that they play a sport. Another reason why cheerleading is a sport id because of how flexible and gymnasty they have to be. What this means is to be a cheeleader you need to have some type of gymnastics backround because of all of the flips abd tumbling that cheerleaders have to do. Like the American Acadamy of Pediatrics reports on cheerleading injuries it days &quot; over the last centry, cheeleading has envolved dramatically into a competitive, physical demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast pace floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastic-style tumbling, and competitive stunts.&quot; What this means is that cheerleading is a grueling sport with alot of skills like gymnastic that cheerleaders need to know how to do to be a competitive cheerleader.]]>

In cheerleading you have to be as strong as a football player in order to lift the participants.For example,&quot;Over the last century,cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps,gymnastic-style tumbling,and complex stunts,such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air,&quot; (AAP report).This quote is an example that chearleading is just like any other sport because its states that chearleading is similair to gymnastics and the chearleaders must be as strong or stronger than football players to lift the athletes in the air. Cheerleading takes as much energy and practice as any other sport. A quote that supports my reasoning is,&quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball team anymore;it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dance, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah,rah,rah' and shaking pompoms,&quot; (Director of CCP). This quote explains the structure of cheerleading and how its just like an other sport due to the amount of detication and talent that the athletes put into it. Many people agree that cheerleading should be designated and considered a sport. American Academy of Pediatrics said,&quot; Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies ...and school athletic departments.&quot; This quote supports my reasoning because it agrees with the statement that people do consider cheerleading a sport and that it should be designate as a sport due to the work that goes into it. Under Title IX, a sport must have coaches,practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization. Title IX states all the more reasons why cheerleadin should be considered a sport. Cheerleading follows the regulation since high school teams have practices and coaches, All star cheerleading goes to various and mutiples of competitions &quot;Worlds,&quot; being the biggets one, our defined season is september due to school's football season, and we have governing organization since the 'activity' waiver must be signed by your parent or guardian.]]>

Cheerleading is hard work for girl athetes. American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries. Over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitave, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style trumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyrimid building and tossing atheletes in the air. American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries says &quot;cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subjecte to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments. Biediger v. Quinnipiac Univercity, a 2010 disrtrict court case in Connecticut, which ruled that cheerleading was not a sport, according to Title IX regulations; dicision was upheld in 2012 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which stated that cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport. Title IX regulations require universities to offer equal athletic opptunities to both men and women; under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices competitions during a defined season, and governing organization; its main goal must be to complete. Director of competetive cheerleading program says, &quot;cheerleading isnt about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore its about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Faomous cheerleaders, former president George W. Bush, served as a head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, durring his senior year of high school. Cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898; members of the &quot;Pep club&quot; elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crowd during the football teams last game of the season. Natinal cheerleading organization sponsors regional and natinal competitions and champoionship events; high school cheer camps; youth camps. Even though cheerleading used to be all about cheering, someone stepped up and asked to have a change. To make cheerleading a natinal sport. And to have coaches and to have competitions. And as people stepped up and said what needed to be done, cheerleading has changed for the good.]]>

They have the strenth of football players, the grace of gymnists, and as much agility as track runners. In fact, the exact dictionary definition of an athlete is, &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; All of those other sports players are known as athletes while cheerleaders are not, even though they share almost all of the same properties and capibilities. Cheerleading isn't just encouraging high school sports teams anymore. Now, cheerleaders are competitively fighting for awards and top spots at local competitions. If a team is increadibly excellent at their profession, they can compete at higher scale competitions with more and harder teams to face. There, they use their agility, strength, and endurance to try to bring home the gold, just like all other sports. If cheerleading isn't counted as a sport, then all other school activities shouldn't be either. The dangerous activity, cheerleading, should be considered a sport because of how dangerous it is. If cheerleading isn't adopted into the sports community, the injuries could continue to increase. With stunts becoming more and more dangerous, without certain rules the amount of injuries will drastically increase. The American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries states, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies... and school athletic departments.&quot; The author of this article is absolutly correct. They realize that if we set rules to this sport, then the amount of cheerleading injuries will decrease because cheerleaders will be protected by the law and will have proper equippment and other tools needed to cheerlead.]]>

The girls and boys who cheer must have the skill of a gymnast,the grace of a dancer,and he strengh of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Also in cheer you have to be flexible to preform skills.Just like gymnasts in cheer you have to preform tumbling skills for example: a backhandsping. Some of which can be dangorous and can even lead to injuries. In American Acadamy of Pediatrics report on cheer injuries it said ,&quot; over the last century cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastic-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyrimid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot;]]>

Cheerleading meets all of the criteria being listed in the definiton. Why? In cheerleading you need a good amount of body strength, for example you are going to need to lift other cheerleaders up in the air, throw them up in the air, make pyramids and much more in cheerleading. Being a cheerleader is more than just supporting a team and playing with pompoms, you actually do phyisical activity and therefore cheerleading should be considered a sport, not a game. When you are a cheerleader, you need three vital things to be successful at it. You need to be agile, have a good amount of body strength as well be good at dancing, or at least have a knowing of what you might be doing to become a cheerleader.]]>

Directors of cheerleading agree, cheerleading is as demanding as any other, if not more. &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Cheerleading is a demanding activity, and has many aspects that must be perfected. Some might argue that cheerleading needed more regulations before being enstated as a sport, as Title IX argues, however Title IX regulations require all sports to be coached, &quot;have practices, compititions during a defined season, and a governing organization.&quot; Cheerleading rides all of these specified guidelines. Consequently, Cheerleading is a valid sport because it mimics the necessities and guidelines all other sports have.]]>

Cheerleading requires as much athleticism as football or basketball, so it should also be considered a sport. A court ruling that defined cheerleading as not being a sport required coaches, practices, competitions, and a gorverning organization. Cheerleaders have coaches and practices, and some cheerleading groups compete with each other. The governing organization is the National Cheerleading Organization, which sponsers the competitions. According to Title XI regulations, cheerleading should be seen as a true sport.]]>

In sports like football, soccer, basketball, etc. those sports are competive because you still have to have a winner. As being a cheerleader you have to practice and maybe workout a little.

They government should make Cheerleading a sport because they made soccer, tennis, and hockey a sport. Why don't they want Cheerleading to be a sport? I think that the point is that the student is trying to persaude the American Academy of Pediatrics to reconsider making Cheerleading a sport. Their are many girls in this world who knows that they can become a cheerleader. I know that they would be upset because they just don't want to cheer for a basketball or football team. They want to compete and get a metal or tropie to keep so they know that all of that prcticing and hard work doesn't go to waste. Their are many girls and boys who are unique and have the ability to do what no one else could do in a life time. Most of all if they don't make cheerleading a sport then the government will haqve to answer to the parents mother, father, daughter, and son. If they don't make it a sport then all of those girls and boys who stayed after school and came to schoolo on the weekends to practice for 6hrs. It will be disapointing to see all of their hard work go to waste and not have any memeory of it. It should be considered a sport because I have seen so much talent in boys and girls, that it will be heart breaking to the girls and boys who know that they can do it. The main point I am trying to make is that the girls and boys who are cheerleaders will never be able to live that down because they will not be able to cheer with their friends or family. The most important is that they will noit be able to show all of the other schools what they can do and why they want to become number one.]]>

I think this because the student said how cheerleading isn't just yelling different cheers and throwing around pompoms, it also has very dangerous stunts and tumbling tricks. For example, as the student said, cheerleaders make human pyramids, and during routines, they preform many different stunts such as handsprings, flips, and many others. These stunts are very hard to accomplish and they are dangerous. Doing these stunts can easily break a bone, or hurt someone. But cheerleaders are very strong, and they get over it, but maybe not so easy of a recovery. The student aslo says to be a cheerleader, you need to be strong like a football player. I agree with this because of all the lifting they do. As you may be able to tell, cheerleading is an actual sport, its very complex, dangerous, and in need of much flexibility and agility to preform stunts and such.]]>

My guess is you don't have to be very flexible. Gymnastics doesn't require too much muscle. But cheerleading combines gymnastics and football. You have to be strong like a football player and flexible like a gymnast. So when people say cheerleading isn't a sport I can say cheerleading is more a sport than you know. Where would school spirit be without cheerleaders? Those football players who think that they lead the school to victory after they win a game they wouldn't have won the game without cheerleaders. Those cheerleaders get the crowd wild and pumped. Football players get the enthusiasm to play from cheerleaders. So if you get rid of the cheerleaders the football players don't have a job. So you might want to rethink that statement about how cheerleading isn't a sport.]]>

For the athletes who participate in this activity must have the same abilities as any other would in his/her own sport. The very definition of an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot;. Cheerleading has turned into a sport that highly demands physical ability, gymnastic like tumbling, and the ability to complete difficult stunts. Cheerleading should be turned into a sport so it can have rules set to control its structure, which is that of a sport. Cheerleading began because of a pep squad electing &quot;yell leaders&quot;. From that point cheering became an activity that requires the same physical abilities as any other sport. A past president of ours, George W. Bush, served as head cheerleader for his highschool. In 2012 the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled cheerleading a non-sport because it needed clear regulations and to be better organized. From then on cheerleading has become a very well known and competed &quot;sport&quot; through out the country.]]>

You also have to be a good dancer, the routine isn't all flips and pyramids. Most of the routines they do is dancing. Cheerleading is about more than just cheering on sports teams. Many cheer teams compete in national competitions all over the country. There are also summer cheer camps, just as much as there would be football of basketball camps. The sport isn't just for girls, either. There are many male cheerleaders. Cheerleading was actually invented by male students at a college in minnesota.]]>

Fortunatley, I have a way to tell them that and let them understand what the importance of cheerleading is to you and millions of others. They have never played it before, don't let them say what is happening at practices or the meets, YOU. tell THEM what you actually do do when cheering, for an example, you have lots of physical action in this sport as of any other sport like fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air. As I'm talking about athletes, the dictionary defines athletes as a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.]]>

The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Said the director of one competitive cheerleading program. If it were not a sport that required athletic skill, it would not require any physical ability whatsoever. On the contrary, cheerleading does require a person to be physically fit. One must also look at the very definition of the terms &quot;sport&quot; and &quot;athlete.&quot; The dictionary defines an athlete as &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleading requires all three of these, and so by very definition, a cheerleader would be considered an athlete. Title IX states that &quot;a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; it's main goal must be to compete.&quot; There are many cheerleading coaches all over the country, as well as several organizations. Cheerleaders do go to practices and have a season in which they will cheerlead competitively. Although there was a decision upheld in the US Court of Appeals in 2012 stating that &quot;cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport,&quot; there are many competitive cheerleading organizations, and judges at cheerleading competitions do look at specific criteria to determine a winner. If there were no competitive cheerleading organizations, it would be reasonable to say that it is not a sport. However, there are several organizations across the nations with athletes that are dedicated to what they do, comitting to practices and competition. Therefore, by Title IX criteria, and by dictionary definition, cheerleading can be considered a sport in which athletes compete.]]>

Cheerleading also makes you look like a profactional athlete or someone who is trained or skilled in exercise. Many reports were put out about cheerleading such a, people said that cheeleading should be offically choosen or assigned. Cheeleading is not about cheering for and basketball teams or nothing like that, cheerleading is about competion against whomever there cheering against. I would say that cheerleading is a good sport for someone to take and i also think that person will like the activitys and the practice. I would recommend that cheerleading is a good sport and everyone should try it. So many people loved to cheerlead evan famous people such as former presiedent George W Bush,seved as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, during his senior year of high school. Every one like Mr.bush so if he did it maybe people would consider it to be a positive sport vs a negative one.]]>

Because with out it how are you going to do incredible stunts and lift people up in the air, and you need to dance hard and gracfully and you need that load hard voice. So how are you going to be cheerleader if you dont have those things? Another reason is that cheerleading is like football, basketball, and ect. cheerleaders have competions just like football players and all kinds of other sports. Like in basketball or whatever you need compasion, leadership, and good sportmenship. Cheerleading is just like any other sports. Its like three or four different sports all in one sport.]]>

The definition of an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; The American Academy of Pediatrics say that &quot;over the last century, cheerleadinghas evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; This shows how hard cheerleaders have to work compared to any other sport. Cheerleaders must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization acording to the Title IX. As you can see, cheerleading takes a lot more that shaking pompoms or raising up a crowd. Secondly, cheerleading has a long history of hard work and sweat. In 1898 at the University of Minnesota, cheerleading was invented by members of the &quot;pep club&quot; who elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to catch a crowd during the football team's last game of the season. The former president George W. Bust served as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts during his senion year of high school. These people went through a lot to get cheerleading to where it is today. Finally, National cheerleading organizations sponsor regional and national vompetitions and championship events, high school cheer camps, and youth camps to keep the dream of cheerleading alive. People underestimate the power that a cheerleader can have. We as cheerleaders work just as hard as any other sport to get our own spot in the legend of sports.]]>

If you think that cheer leading is not a sport you really should try doing anything that they do when they are cheering. When you are a cheer leader, it seems like you have to be up and going through out the whole entire game.

Not just our lungs and a voicebox. Many do say that cheerleading is not organized or clearly defined enough to be called a sport. A 2010 district court case in Conneticut, which ruled that cheerleading was a sport, according to Title IX regulations; decision was upheld in 2012 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which stated that cheerleading needed better orgamization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport. However, In Title IX regulations it requires Universities to offer equal athletic opputunities to both men and women; under title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices,competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal must be to compete&quot;. In the year of 2014 the main goal of cheerleading is to compete to the best of their ability.]]>

The have to come up with routines for the games and or competitions that they compete in. Cheerleading has just as many injuries as any other sport so why cant it be considered a sport? Most people think that cheerleading is easy all you do is jump around and hold people in the air. Well yes you might do that but it is much more. To hold or throw someone in the air you have to be strong enough to lift them high above your head and be able to hold them there for a short period of time. to also throw them you have to depend on the one being thrown to flip or rotate the correct way so that when you catch them you they don't hurt you or you hurt them in the process. To be physically fit is more than having muscles or being able to lift more than someone. You have to be able to lift some one the same weight or a little bit smaller than you. You have to be able to have cordination of a wide reciever to catch a person or have the ability to do flips not only on a tumbling floor but also on the ground as well. You have to be able to jump a certain hight to do a certain flip or a curtain amount of rotations with in that flip. Thus making Cheerleading as much as a sport as anything else.]]>

In reality chearleaders do as much work as the football players. I believe that they say that because it may not be a manly sport, but cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898. The &quot;pep club&quot; elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to get the crowd going at the last game of a football season (website of international cheer organization). Another thing is that George W. Bush served as head leader of of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, during his senior year in high school (Famous Cherleaders). I would like to see one of the football players go and do what the cheerleader do. It would be hard work for them. Just like when men say that girls are not as strong as women it gives us the oppertunity to prove them wrong. We may be even mentally stronger than what they are. Who say cheerleaders are not athletes? The definition of an athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina (dictionary). I feel that the cheerleaders have all those qualities. Cheerleading is not about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it is about competiting. The boys and girls who cheer must havethe skills of a gymnist, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms (Director of a competitive cheerleading program).Cheerleaders have more than enough to become a sport.]]>

The people who are in cheerleading must have gymnastic and dancing skills, with great strength, cheerleaders do more than shout and wave pompoms (Director of a competitive cheerleading program). According to any common dictionary, an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot;. This accurately describes cheerleaders. Cheerleading needs to be considered a sport for legal purposes as well. Because cheerleading is not cosidered a sport, it does not have any rules set by sports governing bodies and athletic departments (American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries). Cheerleading isn't about cheering anymore; there is more competion to it in recent years (Director of a competitive cheerleading program). In 2010 a district court case in Connecticut, ruled that cheerleading was not a sport, since it lacked rules and organization (Biediger v. Quinnipiac University). Cheerleading can easily get oraganized if it already isn't, and state rules for the court so that it may be considered a sport.]]>

The definition of a true althete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleaders have to be as conditioned as any other sport being played if you want to succeed at achieving it. They have to be strong enough to lift and throw a girl in the air. They also have to be capable of achieving stunts and tumbling performances. Cheerleaders have to have enough flexibility to leap into the air off of the ground, or in the air when they are trying to lift another team-mate. Cheerleading should be considered a sport for many other reasons. First off I would like to point out that if cheerleaders have compititions and meets to get better and improve their technique. Any other sport, if you want to get better, would have a camp, or club team available for you to join and succeed. If you are not willing to do the sport, then you will not get any better. I think that cheerleaders would face the same questions. If you want to do something you practice for it. Cheerleaders also have many other athletic qualities than just cheering at a football game. They have to be capable of keeping their stamina in check, and not get to tired to make a pyramid for the crowds enjoyment. From the evidence I was given, I believe that cheerleading should be condsidered a sport.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[An athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.Cheerleaders use all of those things when they compete or cheer at games. In my opinion cheerleaders should get more credit for what they do. I would like to see the football players do back hand springs, and back tucks, and do toe touches, and even build pyramids as well as the cheerleaders do right now. Cheerleaders get hurt cheering about as much as any other sport, maybe even more. The American Acadamy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries is, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and throwing athletes in the air.&quot; American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries also said, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; biediger v. Quinnipac University- a 2010 district court case in Connecticut, which ruled that cheerleading was not a sport, according to Title IX regulations; decision was upheld in 2012 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which stated that cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport. And as read in Title IX regulations, requires universities to offer equal athletic opportunities to both men and women; under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competions during defind seasons and a governing organization; its main goal must to be compete. Amd therefore cheerleading became a sport. Most people think cheerleading is all fun and games and yelling Go Team!, but in all reality it's hard work. Throughout the whole entire routine no one is sitting around doing nothing you are always moving. Director of a competetive cheerleading program says, &quot;Cheerleading isn't all about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skill of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah 'rah 'rah and shaking pompoms.&quot; In my opinion he is right, yelling and pompoms isn't even close to the first thing about cheerleading. It's your passion and drive for the sport. Cheerleading isn't just for girls, it's for boys too. Famous cheerleaders say &quot;former president George W. Bush, served as head of Phillps Acadamy in Andover, Massachusetts, during his senior year of high school. Website or international cheer organiztaion says, &quot;cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898; members of the &quot;pep club&quot; elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage teh crowd during the football team's last game of the season. There are also different kinds off cheer, there is sideline, competition, and even cheer camps. National cheerleading organization sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events, they also do hihg school cheer camps and youth cheer camps. So next time someone asks you or the topic of conversation pops up, you be sure to the them that cheerleading is a sport.]]>

So does football players and other athletes of other games. With all the notes the student took it definitely shows that cheerleading is a sport like any other. Originally this sport was played by boys to cheer on their football teams. People consider gymnastics a sport why not this. Cheerleading requires a lot of strength in order for them to do the cheers they do.]]>

Even though that the Title IX says that if a cheer team doesn't have a coach, practices and competitons, then it's not a real sport's team. Who cares about what the Title IX has to say. I say that if they don't like what others have to say good about cheer then they can take it to court. I know that i'm getting carried away but I will speak up for everyone that loves cheer! In Conclusion, i agree that the cheerleading is a real sport because the practices of cheer is like football practices. They are really fit like them and need to have endurance, stamina, flexiblity, and agility like other sports. I realize that the Title IX took the topic of cheer to court but people needed to learn that the fact cheer is a sport. So I hope this encourages everyone that reads this should no that, if you love something so much don't be afarid to speak what you love.]]>

An American Academy of Pediatrics report states that &quot;cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competive, physically demanding, year-round activity of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps,gymnastics-style tumbling, and compex stunts, such as pyramid building.&quot; &quot;Cheerleading isn't aboutcheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; said the Director of competive sheerleading.

When people imagine a chearleader they see only(usually a girl) someone who holds pompoms and yells at games. While now days chear leaders only compete at regional and national levels.Instead of at games. I realize that many don't consider cheerleading a sport because it doesn't involve a goal or a basket or a net like most sports. Cheerleading is prabably one of the most vigorating and physically demanding sports ever. Like the boy said before, if you are a cheerlaeder you have to be strong like a football player and flexable like a gymnyst. Both are very major sports and are recondized as so.]]>

Cheerleading is definitely a competitive sport with training and competitions so cheerleaders would be athletes, wouldn't they? The American Academy of pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries says &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies....and school athletic departments.&quot; Lots of people even argue that cheerleading should be ruled a sport. The regulations of Title IX state &quot;require universities to offer equal athletic opportunities to both mean and women; under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season.&quot; Cheerleading is al those things isn't it?

A president has cheered before and that counts for a lot. You have to remember a lot of moves for a big high school football game or high school basketball game.

Title IX says that &quot;A sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal must be to compete.&quot; Cheerleading definitely fits that category. It isn't just set at football games, and soccer tournaments; it's its own game. Cheerleaders of both gender travel with their team and compete against other squads. Cheerleading, just like any other organized sport, has a game plan. Before a competion, coaches and athletes on the squad help to make up their own routine. Its usually a combination of flips, tumbling, flying, and sometimes dance. They must practice and practice until it is perfect before they can go off and compete. Did you know that male students were the first to invent cheerleading? In 1898, at the University of Minnesota, the &quot;pep club&quot; chose &quot;yell leaders&quot; to get the crowd excited for the last game of the football season. Today, the National Cheerleading Organization sponsors national and regional competions, championship events, and highshool and youth cheer camps.]]>

Cheerleading takes all of these skills listed. Like many other high school sports, you have to be atheletic. You need you be strong and in shape to complete the practiced routines including individual stunts, and full group stunts. Also, like any other sport, you can get injured. The American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries. They said, &quot;Over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitve, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pryamid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; Next, cheerleading is a sport that takes great strength and stamina. It also requires dedication and time to compete as a cheerleader. You don't just show up and know every step of your routine, you have to practice like any other sport. Also, as a male cheerleader, you have to be in great physical shape that will inable you to perform stunts and toss other athletes in the air. &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore,&quot; says a director of a competitive cheerleading program, &quot;it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is not more than yelling 'rah rah rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; This statement is true even for men. Since, the invention of male cheerleading in 1898 at the University of Minnesota, both male and female cheerleaders have been working hard to compete and excel in cheerleading. Finally, cheerleading is like any other sport. Title IX regulations require universities to have cheerleaing open to both gender, have coaches, practices, competitions, and have a defined season. All of these qualities are exactly like any other sport. Cheerleading requires athletes to compete, train, and be skilled in this sport that requires every physical need that it needs to succeed.]]>

People of both genders spend many hard working hours training for their competitions, just like football, basketball, soccer, and baseball players do. It takes just as much, if not more, speed and agility to do cheer than it does for any other sport. The regulations for being a sport are you must have a coach and you must practice and compete. That's what cheerleaders do. They're are rules, but they have more lieniency towards the teams. The more original you are with your routines, the better you will be scored. Just like many directors and coaches would say, cheerleading isn't just about cheering on your school's football team anymore. It is hard work, and it takes a lot of time and dedication, just like any other sport. National cheerleading organizations sponsor regional and national competitions, proving that cheerleaders do compete just like any other sport.]]>

There is a lot of work that goes into cheer leading memerizing the cheers, learning the routeen, and builing up the musle to lift up there fellow teem mates. That all takes hard work and detication showing up to practice on time, never missing a practice, and practicing at home.

A cheerleader has to &quot;... have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot;, according to the director of a competitive cheerleading program. This means that cheerleaders have to be very athletic, flexable, and aware of their body movements. They are not just cheering on their team, they are doing actual work, and they have competitions for how well they do their &quot;sport&quot;. Their are even camps designated to cheerleading. Cheerleading should be a sport. The American Academy of Pediatrics says that &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies... and school athletic departments. Cheerleading needs better &quot;... organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport.&quot; according to Title IX regulations. A Title IX sport must have &quot;... coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization.&quot; This means that cheering teams and organizations need to define a season and a governing organization.]]>

People are always asking me if cheerleading is a real sport and what is my opinion is. Well first im going to talk about why do people think cheerleading is a sport and why they do think that in there own personal opinion. Then i'm going to talk about why other people don't think that cheerleading should be considered as a sport.Finally i'm going to talk about the &quot; Title IX regulation&quot; and why they don't want cheerleading to be a sport. Why do people want to have cheerleading as a sport? Cheerleading on some cercomestances they comsider a sport because of all the exersing that they are doing. American Academy of Pediatrics think that cheerleading should be a sport. The reason because &quot; So that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports govering bodies...and school athletic deartments. &quot; Thats one of the reasons why people want cheerleading to be a sport because they want people to be safe. &quot;Cheerleading can be considered a sport because they do have sponsers regional and nation compitetions and championship events; high school cheer camps;youth camps. Why don't people want to have cheerleading as a sport? People doesn't want cheerleading to be a sport because &quot; Biediger v. Quinnipiac University says that cheerleading is not a sport because it needed better organization and clearly defined riles before it could be considered a sport.&quot; Maybe people don't want there kids to get hurt. So the&quot; TItle IX regulations- require Universities to offer equal athletic opportunities to both men and wimen; under Title IX, a spirt must have coaches,practices and competitions duringa defined season and a govering oranization; its main goal must be to compete.&quot;]]>

According to a director of a competitive cheerleading program, &quot;cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more then yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompons&quot;. Cheerleading requires more than leading the crowd in chants. Cheerleaders have to be athletic and have to practice. The dictionary states that an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot;. Therefore, cheerleading requires as much dedication, practice, and skill as any other sport. Just like any other sport, cheerleading can be dangerous. The American Academy of Pediatrics reports that &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air&quot;. Cheerleading isn't just about cheering, it's about getting crowds excited, and getting some crowds excited requires more than just cheering. It requires stunts and other dangerous things that can, just like other sports such as football, ruin someones career if not executed correctly. Cheerleading is just like any other sport, therefore, it should be considered one.]]>

Under this definition, cheerleaders can be refered to as athletes, as cheerleading is an activity that requires great amounts of strength, stamina and rigor. It is certainly an athletic endeavor, but many may argue that is not a &quot;sport&quot; in the sense that it does not have clear rules or any formal competitions where there is a clear winner or loser. This is not the case. Many people have a very rigid and specific definition for sport, which, by nature, is a broad and general term that can encompass a wide range of physical activities. For instance, cycling is often considered a sport even for cyclists who do not participate in any races, and cycle sheerly for recreational purposes. Cheerleading, on the other hand, is often very competitive (despite the loose criteria of a competition in the cheerleading world) and is a major commitment for any participants. Under this logic, cheerleading can deifinetly be considered a sport. It is stated in Title IX regulations that, in order for something to be considered a sport, its main goal must be to compete. This statement is very ambiguous, and the word compete does not imply that an activity that does not follow the same criteria in terms of organized competition applied to orthodox sports, such as football or basketball, cannot be considered a sport. Cheerleading is widely considered to be competitive now, and there are even regional and national cheering competitions and championship events sponsored by the national cheerleading orgainization. So if a sport is defined as a physical activity thats main purpose is to compete, cheerleading can definetly be considered a sport.]]>

As you would think that the cheerleaders are cheering for the football team but is incorect. All they do any more is just compete with other schools to see who can jump the highest. IX regulations require universities to offer equal athletic oppertunities to both men and women. Inorder of cheerleading to become a sport it musut have coaches, practices, and competitions during a defined season and its main goal is to compete. Even when George W.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[In my eyes, there is no question that cheerleading is a sport. At the Biediger v.s. Quinnipiac University case in 2012, cheerleading getting considered a sport got a big thumbs down. Why was this the ruling? They stated that cheerleading needed more rules and better organization before it could be considered a sport. I believe that they were wrong. New rules and and more organization would really create problems. For example, the games would get very confusing if we had so many different judges scoring the two different sports all at once. People would be distracted and would not enjoy coming to games that they had to watch two very different activites all at once. Cheerleading does not need anything more to make it a sport, it already is great the way it is. It is time for it to become a sport. Can you picture a game without the cheerleaders supportive cheers and impressive moves? Many people probably think that cheerleaders just dance around, shaking pom-poms, and yelling just for the fun of it. They most likely do not think of all of the practice and talent it takes to do this though. Anyone can cheer, but cheerleaders do more than that. They are always there, doing their acrobatic tricks, supporting the team and cheering their hearts out. Think of all of those games where not many people are supporting your team. The players are let down and will not want to work as hard to win, but with the cheerleaders there, it makes them feel like they have strong support. Cheerleading should be considered a sport because they work hard and practice, just like any other sport. They deseve their rightful title.]]>

When I gathered information and put it into notes I realized it was pretty obvise that cheerleading is a sport. They compete in compititons around the state or area they live in they also get hurt like athletes do. They have to be fit to do all the tricks that they do. The cheerleaders have teams of them to show off there talent. It could take more talent than some of the other sports because they need every single one of them to be fit and no what they are doing or it makes the whole team look bad. In other sports if they have a bad player all they do it bench them. In cheer leading as far as I know the whole team plays at once. The definition of athlete is that every single one exercises and and trains for the event. The cheer leaders do just like any other basketball team. They also have a wider range of opertunitys from basketball games to football games and also competitions.]]>

It's an activity consisting fast-pased floor routines with a lot of leaps and jumps, tumbling, and unique stunts such as pyramid buliding and tossing people in the air. Even though the US Court of Appeals think that chearleading should be more organized and clearly defined rules before it could become its own sport. Cheering wasn't about cheering for your school team such as a football team or a basketball team anymore. Cheering is more them getting infront a group of people screaming rah rah rah and shaking there pom poms. Its the athleticism and the passion for it that counts. Did you know that the famous George Bush was a cheerleader in his school at Phillips Academy? During his senior year as a matter of fact. So now cheering is its own sport. Now they have high school cheer camps and youth camps for future cheerers or advanced.]]>

You need the skill to be able to do the flips and tricks they do. You have to practice to get good at cheerleading just like any other sport. They have compitions and compete just like anyother sport. They win trophies and medals just like any other sport. So cheerleading is a sport. Because if they have skill, strength, abliity, comptitions, and awards just like any sport. Then cheerleading is a sport just like anyother sport. I just don't understand why people don't just accept that it is a sport. Like cheerleaders arnt saying basketball isn't a sport or baseball isnt. Cheerleading is just as a sport as basketball or baseball. They have tryouts and people get cut. They have to practice every day and they will get hurt. They have to compete against other teams and they win and lose. They get bronze, silver, and gold. And cheerleading is a national sport, they have a national final and cheerleading camps. So people will say that it isn't a sport but they should look at the facts.]]>

First look at the dictonary definition of an athlete, &quot;a person woh is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; As stated before, cheerleading requires most, if not all, of these important skills. The American Academy of Pediatricts say, &quot;Cheerleading shoud be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies.... and school athletic departments.&quot; Basically, cheerleading should be made an official sport so that it can follow the rules set up by sports regulators. A lot of people think cheerleading is just for sports events, which is wrong. A director of a competitive cheerleading program states that, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the foorball and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot;]]>

It was even proved because the cheerleaders are doing dangerous physical activity and are training just as hard as other athletes of different sports. Over the centuries, the sport has evolved into a &quot;competative and physically demanding and year round sport&quot; which is a true claim. Some people may consider the sport &quot;unathletic&quot;, however, that is not true at all. The dictionary definition of an athlete is &quot;A person who is skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot; and I can easily say that cheerleaders fit all those requirments. Currently, cheerleading is no longer done for football or other sport teams, but to compete against other teams. Sure, Title IX states that &quot;a sport must be offered to both male and female, must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season and a governing organization; it's main goal should be to compete&quot;, However, Cheerleading today now has all those things in most places, so cheerleading really should be considered a sport. There is no way people can say that cheerleading is not a sport when it fits all the needed requirments to be one.]]>

However, cheerleading entails many of the customs that are found in other sports like basketball, baseball, gymnastics...et-cetera. Like these sports, cheerleaders are required to wear uniforms, go to practices, and compete against other teams (or squads, in this case) in competitions. These competitions are held at both a local and national scale, and are sometimes sponsored by the National Cheerleading Organization. A common misconception is that cheerleaders are a group of girls that simply root for their team. This is far from true. While they do a lot of cheering when they are rooting for their team, cheering competitions are mainly a show of synchronized gymnastics. The people competing in this need to have both gymnastic skills, strength, and grace. Also, cheerleading squads are not always all girls. Boys are welcome to participate too, and was actually invented by a group of male college students. One such example of a male cheerleader is former president George W. Bush. He served as the head cheerleader for his high school in his senior year. I feel that cheerleading should be considered a sport. Not only do the athletes involved need to meet a sufficient level of stamina, strength, and grace, they also need to be able to do various gymnastic stunts, many of which can be very difficult. Even though cheerleading may not be considered a sport now, it could very well become one in the future.]]>

Cheerleaders would have to be able to endure the pressure and extremes of practice and tryouts. Also they would have to be able to be strong enough to carry they weight of their other team mates. A cheerleader would have to go through the same things an 'athlete' would have to, if not more. Dont forget that the American Academy of Pediatrics said that &quot;Over the last centry, cheerleading has envolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastic-style tumbling and complex stunts, such as a pyrimid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; Apparently people want to be able play such a wonderful competitive athletic. Including that in 2010 a distict court case in Connecticut was in order, in 2012 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated that cheerleading needed better organization abd clearly defined rules befire it could be considered an actual sport. In fact cheerleading has rules which does apply to which sporting event they are cheering at, for example at a basketball game a cheerleader is not allowed to talk during a free throw. Which is an important rule in the wrold of cheerleading. Not to mention in Title IX regulations require universities to offer equal athletic opportunities to both men and women, under that listing in infact cheerleading. Also adding that just because girls may prance around in skirts and shake pompoms doesn't mean that they do not have any responsibilties to with hold. In conclusion, cheerleading is a sport, a dangerous and competitive one at that. Many people should consider the hardships that cheerleaders have to indure to get to where they are. Cheerleaders have to go through a lot to be considered a good cheerleader no matter what it may be. It could be academics, school spirit, or even representing their school in a very good mannerr.]]>

And like it says up top cheerleading has changed drastically into a competitive sport, where both boys and girls have to be at the top of their physique.

Cheerleaders have to learn skills such as handstands, just like basketball players have to learn the skills of dribbling. In order to be a cheerleader, you have to build up your stamina to be able to exictute skills properly. In many other sports such as; swimming, football, and soccer, players stamina must be built up for them to be able to play the sport correctly, or without ease. &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year round sctivity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyrimid building and tossing athletes in the air,&quot; ststes the American Academy of pediactrics. Therefore cheerleading is just a demanding and physically exhausting as any other sport. Cheerleaders have to be able to lift a person, or people in the air, while football players only have to throw a ball. Cheerleading demands more of the athlete than most sports do. Cheerleading should be considered a sport because of the demands it requires from each player/team mate.]]>

In a way you have to have athletic ability to do cheerleading.

Title IX regulations require universities to offer equal athletic opportunites to both men and women. Also, a sport must have coches, practices, competitions,durig a deifined season, a governing oragnization, and to be able to compete. Title IX regulations state that of 2012, cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could even be considered a state. But, if you think about it, cheerleading meets all of those requirements. Cheerleading is for both male and female, it has multiple practices and coaches, it is such thing as &quot;cheer season&quot;, and the main reason to cheer is to compete against one another. Even the Nationalo cheerleading organization sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events, highschool and youth cheer camps. Everyone thinks that cheerleading is just yelling 'rah rah rah' and shaking pompoms. But in reality, its way more than that. The Director of a competitive cheerleading program said that, &quot;cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. Cheerleaders alot of skills. They need the skills of a gymnast the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. There are even famous cheerleaders like George W. Bush was a cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover Massachusetts. Football, basketball, and baseball players only throw and catch balls, while cheerleaders throw and catch actual people. I mean, it only makes sense for cheerleading to become an offical sport.]]>

The defintion and this sentence are nearly identical. &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; This was said by the American Academy of Pediatrics. They support the writer's claim. Director of a competitive cheerleading program - &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and th strength of a football player.

I would too, which is why I think that cheerleading should be a sport. People think that cheerleading is only done by pretty girls because their boyfriend is on the team, and they want to cheer them on. They think that all you do is say, &quot;Give me an A! Give me a W!&quot; and that's it, but cheerleading is much more than that. Cheerleaders are very athletic, probably more so than some athletes in other sports. Cheerleading requires you to be fast, agile, flexible, and strong. It also has very demanding coaches, with a schedule, and competitions as well. Cheerleaders also can get injuries just as much as the other sports. This is why I think that Cheerleading should be a real sport. People think that all cheerleaders do is yell a little and cheer on the team. There's much more than that. When a cheerleading team competes they do so many different things. Some of these things include, &quot;fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air&quot; as said by the American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries. To coordinate all of this the team has to have a coach, that helps them practice and to teach them to do their routines. Occording to a court case between Biediger v. and Quinnipiac University cheerleading was not a sport because it needed, &quot;better orginization, and a set of clearly defined rules.&quot; Cheerleading teams are organized. They have to be to go to all of their competitions and practices to actually get good. They also do have a set of defined rules, including showing up to practice, and other various rules. Even with all of these rules though cheerleaders can still get hurt. Imagine your team mate throws you into the air and doesnt catch you. You may break a bone. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, &quot;Cheerleading should be a designated sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies and school athletic departments. Now that you know of cheerleading, what do you think of it now being a sport? Cheerleading should be a sport because it follows all of the rules and regulations that other sports abide by, it's just always been pushed to the side when people hear about how it should be a sport. Cheerleaders have to be athletic to do their sport. They also get injured as much as any other sport, so their school/ sport governing bodies would give them rules to abide by. Finally, they do have organized guidelines and orginization needed to be considered a sport.]]>

Not only are directors taking notice, so are the court systems. A 2010 district court case in Connecticut, which ruled that cheerleading was not a sport, according to Title IX regulations; decision was upheld in 2012 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which stated that cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport. But in Title IX regulations--require universities to offer equal athletic oppurtuities to both men and women; under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing oganization; its main goal must be to compete. Which for cheer, all of the above is true. Also in the dictionary an athlete can be defined as a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. Therefore cheerleaders are athletes who play a sport.]]>

The definition of an atholeat is a person who is trained in skilled exercises, sports, or games reqirering agility, physical strength, or stamina. Isn't that what a chearleader is, so chearleaders can be considerds atholeates. Also over the last century chearleading has evolved into a very competative and demanding activity. That is the first reason I beleve cherlading is a legitimate sport. A second reason I belelve chearleading is a legetimate sport is that a famus person has been a chearleader. If a person were to look at all sports they would be able to find some one famous who played that sport. I beleve that is a important requirement for something to be classafied as a sport. Now the question now is do I know anone famous who was a cheerleader? I do former president Gerorge Bush was head cheerleader of Phillips acaamiy. That is a second reason why I belelve cheerleading is a legitimate sport.]]>

Its the same thing as dance. some people may not take is serious or may not think that it is a sport but you sometimes have to lift people and you have to be able to bend very weirdly and hold youself up in some situations. so you do need strenght, and it goes back to what i said before.. if your not in the sport you dont know how hard it really is, it can seem so easy but in reality its harder then any other stport you've played. in concution i think that nomatter who you are you're going to think of it whatever way you want to, weather you think its a sport or you dont. its your own opinion.]]>

Bush did cheer he was the head cheerleader at his higschool his senior year. cheer leaders have to be very flexable and very strong cheerleaders have to lift very heavy people up in the air and then throw them and then catch them and put them back up. cheer is very hard not every one can do cheer its on of those sports where people tell you its not a sport and you have to give out a big speech and tell everyone it is a sport and you have to prove it to them how it is a sport. if cheer was easy it would be called football. cheer is very hard you have to work very hard to do the things you need to do. i love cheer it is very fun and you get to do a lot of things and meet new people and make alot of new friends. cheer is a lot of fun. you get to call your team mates family because they will never let you down its amazing cheer will make your day even better i dont know why its not a sport gymnastics isnt a sport then beacuse you do the same exact things but in cheer you can do more cool things.]]>

According to Title IX regulations, universities need to offer equal athletic opportunities to both men and women. Also, Title IX regulations states that a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing orginazation for it's goal to be complete. Cheerleading does have coaches, we have regularly scheduled practices, we go to competitions during football and basketball season, and we even have our own governing orginazation. Wouldn't that then mean cheerleading is considered a sport? I was reading the statement of one of the directors of a highly competitive cheerleading program, she says, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more then yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; To some, cheerleading is viewed as a cutesy little rally in which students offer support to thier team. But to us cheerleaders, it is actually about the competitions, the stunts, the strength, the brutality cheerleading really brings. It isn't just some cutesy get together where we yell for our school team, it's just like any other sport, we work as a team, to win, and to bring honor to ourselves.]]>

It is true that cheerleaders need strenghth when they throw their friends into the air, and when they catch them coming down. The average cheerleder would have to weight from 110-150 pounds, but if you mix that with gravity then she/he will most definatly weigh more coming down. A crowd isnt enough to make a football team get pumped, it's also the cheerleaders, as they scream the names and shout. Nothing, and i mean nothing, could make those 200 pound jarheads get jazzed up like an American cheerleader screaming their name at the top of their lungs. But its also the victory of winning that excites the cheerleaders and the football players and thats why they do what they do.]]>

As a result i do believe two things,one that a cheerleader is an athlete and two cheeleading is a real sport.

As said in the dictionary, an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excersises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; The American Acadamy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries said &quot;Over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically, demanding, year round activity consisting of fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as the pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; These are peoples opinions but some facts are proven to be true when it comes to cheerleading and whether it should be considered a sport or not. Many famous people in the past have been on some kind of cheerleading team. George W. Bush served as a head cheerleading of Phillips Acadamy in Andover, Massachusetts, during his senior year of high school. Cheerleading was actually invented by a group of male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898; members of the universitys &quot;pep club&quot; elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crowd during the football team's last game of the season. All in all cheerleading should be considered a sport just like basketball or football, but many people disagree and dont care about it as much like they do with football or other sports.]]>

Over the years cheer leading has increased majorly and is more competitive. It is also more demanding physically. Some people say that cheerleading should be a sport and some say it shouldn't. I however think that it should be a sport. Cheerleaders have to have just as hard of practices as any other sports do. They have to put themselves out infront of a crowd and cheer for their team even if they are losing. Cheerleaders have to put a lot of hard work into what they do. But, most of the time they don't get the credit they should get for it. Cheerleading isn't just cheering the team on and when the team is done playing for the season they are done. They have competitions to see who has the best cheerleading skills. After the sport's season that they are cheering for is done, they go to a competition to show off their cheers. They work very hard for what they do. Cheerleaders have to be strong, graceful, and skillful all at the same time.]]>

Cheerleading has grown into a physically and mentally demanding sport that is every bit as difficult as football or basketball. A report that the American Academy of Pediatrics put out states that &quot;Cheerleading has dramatically evolved into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling , and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes into the air. Cheerleading mixes the various components of other sports to create a very physically strenuating exercise. Many argue that cheerleading is not a sport because it needs better defined rules. In the case Biediger v. Quinnipiac University, it was argued that cheerleading is not a sport because it &quot;needed better regulations.&quot; The decision was upheld by the court stating that it was not a sport. Though this may be true, I feel that a sport is something that requires skills that can be practiced and requires some sort of physical capabilities. Originally, it was true that cheerleading wasn't a sport because all it's only purpose was to engage the crowd, but now it is a competitive sport requiring mental and physical stamina. Next time you argue that cheerleading is or is not a sport I urge you to take into account my argument before making any judgements.]]>

You have to be as strong as a football player whilst being as flexible as a gymnast. According to the dictionary an athlete is &quot;A person who is trained or skilled in excersizes, sports, or games requiring physsical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Also, according to the Academy of Pediatrics &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by governing bodies... and school athletic departments.&quot; These two sources have stated that cheerleading is a sport, because the athletes are trained and skilled, also, they have to follow rules. Cheerleading is more than just a dream that little girls have, it might have been a while ago, but cheerleading has evolved into something more competetive and intense now. The director of a competetive cheerleading program said &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheerleading is more than yelling 'rah rah rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; As you can see, cheerleading is a sport. Many sources and sites have agreed, saying that cheerleaders need more skills than just a football player, or just a gymnast, or just a dancer, They need to have their own strength, wich is a step up from other sports. So cheerleading may not be thought of as a sport, because it is harder than a sport.]]>

The most important reasons though are that a lot a people consider it a sport already, and cheerleaders work just as hard as other athletes, like say a football player or a tennis player. All of the people that already consider cheerleading a sport are some very professional people that know a lot about the sport. What I mean by that is that the people that consider it a sport come from universities and academies, and they know much more about cheerleading than anyone else. Those kind of people have dedicated their lives to cheerleading and so they know all of the ins and outs. Of course these people's ideas about cheerleading might be a little biased just for the reason that they have been doing this sport for their whole lives. Cheerleaders also work just as hard as the hardest working football player or any other sport for that matter. Also in cheerleading there is more than just one skill you need. You have to be tough as a football player, have the grace of a dancer, and have the abilities of a gymnest. Cheerleaders also work just as hard for their sport as anyone else works for their sport. In conclusion cheerleading should be considered a sport.]]>

You have to be as tough and strong as a football player because if you weren't you wouldn't be able to carry anyone, throw them into the air, or make a pyramid.

The American Academy of Pediatrics reprot on cheerleading injuries sates, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demandimng, year-round activity consisiting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; That staement says that we are athlete without just coming right out in the open and screaming it in your face. Again they state, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic depatments.&quot; We put in hours and hours a week to show for our work in other sports games, and competions for ourselves. This is a sport and we as cherleaders know this. We have even had presidents be cheerleaders. Other famous people along with presidents. Why should cheerleading not be considered areal sport? Well because it is, thats why we put in the work, and the hours to learn flips, pyriamds, cartwheels, handsprings. Then we should be able to call cheerleading a real sport.]]>

Cheerleading, is it a sport people ask? In my opinion how can it not be. I mean you have to hold people above your head for minutes at a time. Cheerleading would take alot of stength and agility. The agility is used to throw the other cheerleaders into the air. In the dictionary it says that a n athlete has to have agility strength and flexibility.

In the past century cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive sport. It consists of fast-paced floor routines with many leaps and jumps like throughing a person in the air and catching them. Cheerleading has many styles such as gymnastics-style tumbling,and complex stunts. There are many organizations that would help many people understand cheerleading such as a website of international cheering. This website gives facts about the history of the &quot;sport&quot; like electing men to be on the team or having extra people help for cheering. The National cheerleading organization sponsors regional and national competitions. It has high school and youth cheerleading camps every year. The American Academt of Pediatrics report cheerleading injuries. They think cheerleading should become a designed a sport so it can rules and regulations like every other sport.

This goes to prove that &quot; Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore, it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms. After a routine my muscles are sore, I'm sweating and tired from working hard and exerting myself to the best of my abilities. I've played other sports before and I can say that cheer requires no less skill or physical ability than any of them. So, if you doubt that cheer is a sport, I dare you to practice with us for a week. We'll see how fast you change your mind.]]>

According to the student's notes, cheerleading does require physical strength and agility. They must be able to hold up their teammates in a human pyramid or toss them in the air. So, based on the definition of athlete and the notes, a cheerleader should be considered an athlete. The student's notes say that a sport needs coaches, practices, competition during a defined season and a governing organization. Most cheerleading squads have coaches, practices, and competitions. For it to be considered a sport, it would need a defined season and a governing organization, but, for the most part, cheerleading squads have what it needs for cheerleading to be considered a sport.]]>

As any cheerleader whould say they have to use all of these when they use stunts such as a back hand spring, tuck, or even lifting whole athletes in the air. Also in a cheerleading team there are, ??complex...fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling.?? All of these activities take stamina, agility and strength as much as any other sports require. Acording to the Director of a competative cheerleading program, ??Girls and boys who cheer must have skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Next, for more support on the fact that cheerleading should be considered a sport. Under title IX, ??a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal to compete.?? There is many national cheer organizations that hold competitions, camps, and have rules for competing. The athletes meet for practice and many can compete at a national level. In conclusion, cheerleading meets all the rules and requirments of a known guide to distinguishing sports from other activities. Cheerleaders meet the standards of the definition of an athlete, so why is it still many debate that cheer is not a sport. Consider this next time you see a football player, or another type of sport.]]>

Cheerleading takes great precision and athleticism to be able to do all the arobics and acrobatics that they are able to do during basketball games or football games or whatever other sport they would have a cheerleader for. Cheerleading is just as hard as other sports. It takes alot of practice and agility to be a cheerleader and it takes as much time to be able to precicely do something as a cheerleader. As a cheerleader you would need much preperation and much practice with and without gear such as trampolines and and cords to suspend them. They would spend alot of time outside and in the gym practicing things untill they got them right just like you would any other sport.]]>

You have to have a good attitude and have towards your team mates. Cheering also helps people make new friends and enjoy new hobbies. Along the training process, you have to work hard to get to be on the team. Cheering is a sport in my opinion. It takes a lot of time to get good at what you do in cheerleading. It took 3 years for my sister to get good at her back handsprings and cartwheels before she became a cheerleader. She's graduated high school now, but for her junior year, she was head cheerleader. All her hard work paid off when she was accepted as head cheer leader. Anyone can become a cheerleader! President George W. Bush was a cheerleader. Actor Josh Hutcherson was a cheerleader in high school. Singer Taylor Swift was a cheerleader her Freshman year in high school. Heck, even my brother and one of my nephews are/were cheerleaders! One of my friends went to a cheer camp somewhere here in Montana for a week in the summer a couple years ago.]]>

In the notes he gave the definition of the word athlete; An athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, and stamina. In the 7th bullet it say's that even famous people do cheerleading like George W. Bush did in his senior year of High School and he was the head cheerleader at the Academy of Phillips in Andover, Massachusetts. So it all reality cheerleading is sport because you have to have balance, strength, agility, stamina, and they have to be able to hold people up and throw other people.]]>

Cheerleading takes alot of time and effort as does other sports. You must be strong, fast, good with competition, and flexable for cheerleading but in the list i just made alot of those things are used to help you with other sports as well. Say softball/baseball for example: you must be fast to run the bases, you must be srong to hit the ball far and throw the ball far as well, and you need to be flexable in a way to slide into secon, third, or home base.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics' report on cheerleading injuries, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; Due to the types and number of cheerleading related accidents that come into an emergency room each year around the country, cheerleading should be considered a sport so cheerleaders can be safer with rules. Without rules or regulations, cheer coaches can have thier squads do any stunt they wish, and although the coaches don't nessicarily want their athletes hurt but sometimes they don't realize what they are asking is too much. Cheerleading takes alot of skills and time for practicing. According to the director of a competitive cheerleading program, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast. the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Most people don't realize it, but cheerleading takes alot of athltic ability. If a base isn't as stong as a football player, they aren't going to be able to hold up a human pyramid. If a cheerleader has to do a front handspring across the floor but they dont have the abilities of a gymnast, they are going to let down the entire squad and their coach.]]>

Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; What this director said is true. Cheerleaders must not only lift their tems spirits, but must also cheer and perform better than the other teams' cheerleaders to boost the teams spirits even more.

Cheerleading is a lot more than just cheering on a team, it's a sport that invovles strength, agility, confidence, and endurance. Cheerleading also isn't just some activity you can do during school. Cheerleading has organizations involving regional and national competitions, championship events, even camps. Over time, cheerleading has been debated a lot on whether it is considered and actual sport. Title IX regulations explain that under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization. Many school cheerleading organizations all include coaches, practices, and competitions. Me being a cheerleader that has been doing cheer for 4 years, I can easily agree that cheerleading is a sport.]]>

Sure they still cheer for football teams and every other sports, but they also compete. They are the same as baseball or basketball. Cheerleadering has championships. Title IX says that a sport need to have coaches, practices, competitions and the main goal is to compete. That is what all of the cheerlearders do. Even in football games you can see that the opposite team is trying to scream or trying to be better then the other.Even Bush was a cheerleader.

As the American Academy of Pediatrics reoported, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastic-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; But according to Beidiger v. Quinnipiac University-- a 2010 district course case in Connecticut, which ruled that cheerleading was not a sport, according to Title IX regulations; decision was upheld in 2012 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which stated that cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport. But as the student said, cheerleading requires the same strengths as football players and gymnasts to be able to lift up their comrades unto their shoulders, and to perform stunts such as back handsprings. &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strenght of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms,&quot; says a Director of a competitive cheerleading program. Being a director and all of a cheerleading team, the director has seen with their own eyes about what cheerleading is about since they help to warm up their students for competition. So cheerleading should be considered a sport as they do have &quot;coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, a governing organization, and a main goal which is to compete.&quot; The Title IX regulations require these rules to have something even be considered a sport. Cheerleading can be as much of a sport as any other as it holds true to these regulations. In conclusion, cheerleading can be considered a sport.]]>

It used to just be people or what were called &quot;yell leaders&quot; that would try and get the crowd involved in the schools last football game. Now when you hear the word cheerleader you tend to think girls in small clothes jumping around at games. Sometimes thats what it is, but others it isnt. There are different kinds of cheerleaders you could say. The girls at games that are trying to get the crowd to be loud, and the ones that are considered &quot;athetes&quot;. They go to competitions and it has become a competitive thing. Girls getti ng thrown into the air, flipping around and sometimes even suffering serious injuries. It may not compare to football or soccer but it does take certain skills and agility.]]>

The US court of Appeals for the Second Circuit uphelds that decision in 2012. It stated that cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered as a sport. I disagree with that. Cheerleading already has good organization and clear rules. If they didn't then we wouldn't be having huge competitions with judges and girls and guys competing for which team is best in the state, region or even the nation. Athlete. If your an athlete you do sports. You can't do sports if you're not an athlete or athletic, it just doesnt work. The definition of an athlete is this, &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleaders are trained and skilled to get out on that mat and tumble, jump, flips, twists and turns. They clearly have strength to be able to throw girls up in the air and catch them as they fall. Cheerleaders match every part of the definition as an athlete, therefore they should be considered a sport.]]>

For cheerleading to become a sport acording to Title IX reguations is for the sport to be available to men and women, have coaches, practices, competitions, governing organization, and of course a main goal to compete. Once again the American Academy of Pediatrics attempted to talk about cheerleading in a competitive way saying &quot;Cheering has evolved greatly, it is very demanding physically and mentaly, it is fast paced and has many complex stunts.&quot; Cheerleading is a sport and it is just as demanding as the other school sports mentally and physically.]]>

It can also help you have a better chance of you winning the team, but yeah this is why I think that excersizing is a good thing to do before you do any kind of sport..]]>

In my opinion to call something a sport or not it has to be at a certain level of physical activity. Well cheerleading defintinely reaches that level when looking at the report from the American Academy of Pediatrics on cheerleading injuries, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically int a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid buildng and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; I can see where someone not involved in this sport could say it's not a sport. Although cheerleading involves many other sports. Such as, gymnastics, football, and dance. You have to be strong and lift someone up like a football player. You have to move beautifully across the floor like a dancer. Lastly you have to flip like a gymnast.]]>

According to the dictionary, the definition of an athlete is, &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; They may not compete in games, but they do compete in competitions. All of them have to work together to make the routine look as one, not to mention all the crazy facial expressions they have to use to keep the audience interested. As a cheerleader, during our routine, we don't get time to rest. We have to push through until we know we are done and have given it our all. That is why at practices, we work extra hard to build up the stamina and agility, which are two characteristics of an athlete. Cheerleaders have to have physical strength, agility, and stamina just like any other athlete does. When you are a cheerleader, you have to portray many things. The director of a competitive cheerleading program states, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; While having the characteristics of an athlete, you also have to add on people. You have to be three people in one. A gymnast, a dancer, and a football player. The stereotype of a cheerleader is over. Now it's all about the strength, skills, and grace.]]>

The cheerleaders need strength for holding teammates up and flexabilty for doing flips and what not. Cheerleading isnt always about cheering for their school basketball, football or any other sport teams games, its about a competing against other school around the state. In the notes its stated that cheerleading is designed to be a sport that has rules and regulations set foth by sports governing bodies and school athletic departments. Cheerleading is more then just doing flips on the side lines at school games and yelling rah rah rah and shaking their pompoms all around, its more then that!]]>

They need to have endurance too because football for high school is genrally in the fall, and in the upper states it can get cold towards the end of the season.

They have practice, a coach, a governing organization, and competitions. Cheerleading is more than just yelling rah,rah, rah and shaking pompoms. No, it is having the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. So if you think cheerleading should not be considered a sport, think again.

Also the American Academy of Pediatrics report cheerleading inuries as followed, &quot;Over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically, demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid buildings and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; Cheerleaders are exposed to such danger and need so much skill to play such a sport, that most people can't do, than why are we saying it isn't a sport, it needs physical ability and practice just like football or soccer. So do people think it isn't a sport becuase they don't know how hard it actually is? Some will argue that it needs rules before it is considered a sport, but doesn't it already have rules, do you see cheerleaders swearing or using explicit language during a cheer? No, becuase thats part of the rules. Cheerleaders have a set a rules they have to follow in order to become a cheerleader. Some also argue men don't play so it isn't a &quot;manly sport&quot;, but did you know that cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898, or that former president George W. Bush served as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Adover, Massachusetts, during is senior year of high school. I do belive cheerleading is a sport, not becuase I play it but becuase people who are in cheerleading work hard to do so. You don't need men to be in a sport to make it be a sport, as long as there is hard work, determination, and skill anything will be a sport.]]>

When competition comes up it is strict practicing. You cannot weigh to much otherwise you will not be able to be lifted up to do stunts. The skills of a gymnast takes muscle. The boys always have to lift the girls up and throw them around. Gymnasts have to be able to do flips, cartwheels, and front hand springs. Nothing is very easy. People who do not believe cheerleading is a sport is wrong. Anyone of those cheerleaders could get injured when flying in the air. They constantly practice to be in sync. The girls have to say things at the same time, and do moves at the same time. For everyone saying it is not a sport, I would like to see them do it.]]>

One of the facts that prove this is that courts even ruled out that it wasnt a sport, that it would have to be organized before they could even think about it being a sport. People also said that it cant be a sport unless your compeating or practices. He also had facts that for the boys and girls trying out for cheer it wasnt just about cheering for a football team. They must have gymnast skills and grace of dance and also the stregth of a football player. He even had proof that George W. Bush was once a head cheerleader before he became a president. He also had facts that there are competitions around the world for cheerleading. So whether its a sport or not it still takes a lot of work and effort to want to be a cheerleader.]]>

The dictionary definition of an athlete is a person who is skilled or trained in exercises, sports, or games that require physical strength, agility, or stamina. Cheerleading includes all of the above. Cheerleading is also a mixture of sports. The cheerleaders have to be as stong as a football player, have the skills of a gymnast, and the grace of a dancer. Even though it's not considered an official sport, cheerleading requires all the physical needs of any other sport. Cheerleading isn't considered an official sport, because it doesn't have clearly defined rules. Also, it's not very organized. If people would take the time to do so, then the court might rule cheerleading to be an offical sport. The people need to take into consideration the hard work it takes to be a cheerleader. You need to be fit, as in any other sport. You would also need to be strong in order to make a human pyramid. Cherrleading should be considered a sport, because of what it requires lit of people.]]>

Girls and boys get hurt every day around the world cheerleading and they compete to so i think it should be allowed to be a sport. It should be a sport for the regulations and requirements to be a cheerleader instead of holding auditions. Girls with no practice will try and be a cheerleader and they will sometimes get it, but when it comes down to cheering they will get hurt. It should be a sport because they need to be strong to lift the other girls in the air. They also need gymastic skills for flipping and spinning in the air. They go to nationals too and they get judges on how they do just like gymastic players. If anyone sees how much it takes to be a cheerleader it should become a sport then.]]>

The dictionary definition of an athlete is &quot; a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Being able to do several front flips or back flips in a row, being able to throw someone above your head, and doing non-stop hard physical activity for about 3 minutes for cheer competitions requires a lot of strength, agility, and stamina. Same is said in a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics: &quot;... cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity....&quot; Cheerleading has changed and is now more of a competitive, win or lose sport. The national cheerleading organization sponsors several competitions and cheer camps, much like football has competitions and camps. Cheerleading requires physical health and strength. The activity has changed from cheering on the sidelines to having their own competitions, says the director of a competive cheerleading program. It should start being thought of as a sport.]]>

For example, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics say that over the last centruy, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitve, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style, tumbling and ocpmlex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athlets in the air. These all involve some what of movement and have the same or to close enough physical activity to any other sport. The competivness and physical work show that cheerleading is a sport. I also believe that men and woman should get their own rights and opportunities to playing a sport they are compationate about. The Title IX shared that both men and woman should have equal athletic opportunities. They set to have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season. I feel like if we faired up the equility of men and woman playing on opposite sex teams we wouldn't have to worry about things such as harrassing, name calling, misplaced, etc. This would help that athlete focas on that sport he/she is playing and not be too concerned with other things. That is also another reason why we need to support cheerleading as a sport.]]>

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, cheerleading is a, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air. There are many physical demands for cheerleading, which is why it should be a sport. &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms,&quot; says a director of a competetive cheerleading program. The national cheerleading organization sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events; high school cheer camps; youth camps. Dance has big tournaments and camps just like any other sport. Dance is hard sport.]]>

Gymnastics is considered a sport and that's a big part of cheerleading, a lot of the things cheerleaders do are the sam exact things that gymnists do, like back handsprings, backflips, front flips, and a ton of other stuff. When you're doing all of this you have to have good stamina, because if you're at a competition and you get tired and decide to be lazy then you and your team will get points knocked off. It clearly says in the definition of athlete that it's, &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excersises, sports,or games requiring physical strength, agility or stamina&quot;.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Cheerleading for this student is a true sport. In his evidence he explains that &quot; Cheerleading requires just as much athleticism, strength, agility, and endurance as many high school sports&quot; (introduction to the argument). In his introductin to the argument he also compares the needs of a cheerleader to the needs of a football player, and to the needs of a gymnast. He has a few reasons why cheerleading is a sport. In one of his sources with a director from a competitive cheerleading program she/he explains the cheerleading has grown from cheering for football games to it becoming its own sport and competing. he also gives an exampile of a faomous cheerleader George W. Bush that says he was also a cheerleader and that it was also invented by mae students. Also according to the dictionary his definition of what a cheerleader is fairly close to the definition of what a cheerleader is in the dictionary, which is &quot;A person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physicaal strength, agility, or stamina.&quot;. He provides a counter argument also in his evidence. But having the lack of support in the counter argument is that it (to me) is only based off of opinions of people. The student also gives the examples from schools, directors, and former cheerleders that may have all been a part of cheerleading to agree/disagrre wth his statement. These are the reasons i have to sypport the student.]]>

Cheerleading has envolved dramatically over the last century. George W. Bush served as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts in his senior year in high school. This shows that men are capable to do cheerleading as women are. There is a lot of things you have to be able to do in order to be a cheerleader. You have to be able to jump and leap. You have gymnastic style tumbling. You also have to be able to do complex stunts, such as doing a human pyramid. You also have to be able to help toss a fellow cheerleader into the air and catch him/her.]]>

And the cheerleaders opening statement in her paper said that they have to be as strong as football players, and as flexible as gymnasts. So according to the dictionary definition she and other cheerleaders are considered athletes and cheerleading could be considered a sport. To conclude this will be debated like it has for years.There will be some who dont think it is a sport and some who do. Like the Director of Competition Cheerleading Program. He believes &quot;THat Cheerleading isnt about cheering for a football or basketball team, its about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace, of a dancer, and strength of a football player&quot;. So it will forever be argued, but cheerleading certainly has a good case to be called a sport.]]>

As the definition of an athlete states a person who is trained or skilled in excersizes, sports or games, requiring physical strength, agility or stamina. As a cherleader myself, i can conclude that cheerleaders have all of these qualities, so that makes us athletes. As athletes, that would make cheerleading a sport. American Academy of Pediatrcs reported that &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year round activity consisting of fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastis-style tumbling, and complex stunts such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; Athletes that participate in cheerleading are likely to get severly injured, just as football players, soccer players, etc.]]>

You would also need to hold it for some time, meaning you need endurance.

Bush was head cheerleader his senior year. Cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898, and it was called pep-club and they elected yell leaders. Lots of people think that cheerleading is just a thing that a group of poeple do to pep up the team that is from thier school, but there is much more to it. The &quot;National cheerleading organization-sponsors regional and national competitions and chamionship events; high school cheer camps; youth camps.

Well they're wrong. According to a director or competitive cheer leading they said that, &quot;The girls and boys who cheer must have the skill of a gymnist, the grace of a dancer, and the the strangth or a football player.&quot; For cheering to look as amazing as it does, you have to put all of these components together. All of these sports, gymnist, dancer, and football player, they're all sports. Is it bad to combine sports together? Is that what makes cheerleading not a sport? Rugby is a combination of soccer and football almost and that's still considered a sport. Cheerleading has been growing more in the past years. The AMerican Academy of Prediatrics says, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evoloved dramaticly into a comptitive, physically demanding , year round activity consisting of fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumos, gymnatics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athlets in the air.&quot;. This sounds like a more complex version of dancing, doesn't dance count as a sport too? Sports need rules, coaches and competions right? Yeah they do and thats exactly what cheerleading has. Even George W. Bush was a cheerleading in school and he turned out to be President! So what's so wong with cheerleading its a competive sport that takes just as much effort as football.]]>

I think that if cheerleaders go to a football game and jazz the crowd up, then they should be part of the sport too! I do not think that it makes any sense to host a cheerleading competition, or have cheer camps, if it cannot be recognized as a sport. That is like playing ping pong in a competition (which they do) and say it's not a sport. People don't have to do nearly as much work in ping-pong as people do in cheerleading, it would be inappropriate to compare the two. If an athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games, requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina, that's basically what a cheerleader needs to succeed in being a cheerleader!]]>

The student's claim of cheerlaeding is that you must be strong like a football player and flexible like a gymmast. though that it isn't just the strangth, you also must be smart and willing. The student writes that you must have these things to be able to do so many perfomances and bring spirit. to prove this, in the student's notes it says that even Goerge W. Bush one of the formar was head cheerleader during his last year of high school. Goerge Bush was a leader of this nation and that is what cheerleaders are, the ones that lead us through the games giving us spirit and hope. Cheerleading can be dangerous. There are many injuries that can happen from this activity. American Academy of Pediatrics report that this is a sport and should be designated a sport so that is is forced to rules so people won't get hurt and that schools will take thechance of injuries more to the mind and think of it.]]>

You have to be as strong as a football player to lift you're team mates up to make a pyramid. A football player has to learn pthe plays of the book and the cheerleaders have to learn al;l kinds of cheers. Also, cheerleader have to go to practice too and learn cheers and dances. Cheerleading is just athletic or even more athletic to do flips and back hand springs. Cheerleading can be for males too if they want to try out for the sport. In football you have to pay for gear and jersey's the same in cheerleading because you have to pay for you're pom poms and outfits for the game's. You have to be very flexable to move like cheerleaders do. Cheerleaders pump up the football players and give them hope even if they are loosing to win. They have fun cheers that can involve everybody jumping and moving around to pump up the crowd as well. When the team is loosing the cheerlears get the crowd loud so it builds up momentom for the players and they make a great play or even win the game.]]>

But when im watching any game of football,they are all doing flips that i wish Icould do. That takes skill to flop your body in mid air and land it. But like all other sports,someone must get injured in the process but hey, &quot;No pain no game&quot;. So saying that cheerleading is not a sport is like saying Burger king doesnt sell burgers.So if i need to explain more thats what I shall do. To support my reason, im gonna explain to you about the injuries it can cause that matters at all. My cousin does cheerleading for my other cousin (her brother)and she told me that when you land wrong, its going to hurt and maybe even prevent you from countinuing the cheerleading. Just like football,basketball,soccer players etc. they could either end their carrer or skip a season to heal up, depending on how bad the injury was. Every sport needs an injury and cheerleading has just enough to be considered a sport. If i had to add another topic into this essay, it would be about flexibility and being an athlete. So whats your definition of an athlete? I'll give you some time to think........Done yet?Hope so. If you came up with a person whotrained or skilld in anything that requires sports,phisical strength,agility or stamina,you would be correct. Nothing else is needed to say other than being flexible is needed is, then here it comes. To do any sport you have to be flexible, so to say cheerleding is easy, try it for yourself. When you flip, you have to do it on time and if you dont you ccould break something. So just out of curiousity,did you ever dought that cheerleading is not a sport. Well if it did, i hope this helped you reconsider why you are wrong and why i am the champion.]]>

The deffintion of an athlete is, a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stanima. The Amercian Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries quoted, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evovled dramatically into a competitive, physically demandning, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastic-style tumbling, and complex stunts. Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic department.&quot; A 2010 district court case in Connecticut, ruled Cheerleading was not a sport. In 2012 the decision was upheld by the US court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which stated that cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport. What this means is, cheerleading has all the conponents to be a sport it just needs some touches here and there to allow it the be more legitament and overall considered a sport. Cheerleading is a sport for both genders and must have coahces, practices, and competetions. Only then could Cheerleading be considered an actual sport. Cheerleading originated at the university of Minnesota in 1898 by a male who wanted to engage the crown during the football teams last game. From then on cheerleading has exploded into what some call a sport or what other claim to just be people supporting on another legit team. Cheerleaders today are physically fit and strong. Not to mention athletic able to preform hard stunts and even flips and handsprings. As I mentioned in the first paragraph what an athlete, i think any cheerleader qualifys.]]>

Many individuals believe cheerleading is about shaking pompoms and getting the crowd more loud. That is not the case for a director of a competitive cheerleading program who stated, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer,and the strength of a football player.&quot; Cheerleading uses much skill and many injuries occur while cheering. It's a very physical demanding sport. So what is the defintion of a sport? According to a dictionary an athlete: &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; If you're telling me that doing back flips and lifting athletes into the air doesn't require much strength you are mistaken. Even the American Academy of Pediatrics believes it should be a sport after doing a report on cheerleading related injuries stating, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot;]]>

Starting off, the definition of athlete fits cheerleaders. An athlete is defined as &quot; a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; A cheerleader is specially trained in doing many skills with tumbling, holds, and such. Although it obviously varies, a usual routine lasts about five, maybe even ten minutes at most. This requires mass amounts of strength to keep holding the flyers, agility to keep doing flips and such, and stamina to overall keep going after a hard run. Adding on, with all the amount of injuries, cheerleading must be pretty rigorous. According to the american Academy of Pediatrics,&quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramtically into a competitive, physically demanding, year round activity consisting of fast-paced floor rountines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; Reviewing that statement by a trusted, insightful source, it must be true. Cheerleading is no walk in the park, and should be equal to any other sport.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[I support his claim on cheerleading being a true sport, because to play any &quot;true sport&quot; you would have to be some what of an athlete. The dictionary states an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; I do belive that when cheerleading you need, and use all of those requirments of being an athlete. Also the American Academy of Pediatric report on cheerleading injuries say &quot; Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies... and school athletic departments.&quot; If cheerleading is part of the athletic department, then is would be consider a sport. Considering the fact that cheerleaders do floor routines such as dancing, gymnastic-style tumbling such as gymnastics and pyramid building and tossing other athletes in the air, which takes as much strength as a football player, cheerleading is a sport. Most people think &quot;true sports&quot; are football, baseball, basketball, and soccor, ect. All of those are male dominate sports that girls also took apart of. And guess what! Cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898; memebers of the &quot;pep club&quot; elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crowd during the football team's last game of the season -Website os international cheer organization. Yes, Cheerleaders don't have games, but they go to competitions and raise a ton of money to be able to go to these. So Cheer should be a true sport, and it is.]]>

The cheerleaders have to be able to lift other people up off the ground and throw them up in the air. They also have to create pyramids in which there are people at the bottom holding everyone up. So if they did not have strength everyone would just topple over. They need agility and stamina to be able to do fast-paced routines; continuously running, jumping, and doing some sort of flip. Conclusively cheerleading requires a great amount of agility, stamina, and strength. Also, cheerleading can be compared to many sports. The definition of an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot;. Cheerleaders need as much strength as a football player with as much grace and flexibility as a ballerina. Also cheerleaders have to learn new routines or &quot;plays&quot; as it is called in football. Cheerleading is like many other sports; it is like soccer and basketball because you are constantly running around, it is like football because you need strength maybe not to tackle others but to lift them up. Cheerleading is like any other sport in some ways.]]>

Cheer is like several sports mashed into one. &quot;Director of a competitive cheerleading program- &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the foot ball and basketball teams anymore; its about competing.

Cheerleading has rules, games and practices just like many sports like, football, basketball and baseball do. It requires lots of effort and time to be put into and a lot of athletic people with strength to be able to compete in districts. The articles state that many cheerleading squads and groups go and compete for medals and money. Many sports have something like a trophy or a scholarship, just like cheerleading does. Clearly cheerleading is a sport to many people because it has all the same basics as many other sports do. There are regionals, nationals and champion events with cheerleading. Its not about cheering for other teams but it's more about the time and effort that is being put into the routines and the cheers. Cheering is a basic sport that has been known as a sport for many years now and has been put as being a sport. It's main goal for cheering is to compete and be another sport to people. Students at the University of Minnesota in 1898 invented the sport cheerleading that has now been going on since the past years usually being called a sport. The students notes clearly state the fact that cheering has been a sport for many years and has the basic building blocks just like many other sports do.]]>

But &quot;a 2010 district court case in Connecticut, which ruled that cheerleading was not a sport,&quot;. This is saying that cheerleading was considered in the sports catogory but didnt have enough organization and defined rules to be a sport. However, the &quot;National cheerleading organization-sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events; high schol cheer camps; youth camps&quot; that says that they have cetain things that make it a sport. They dont just cheer for the games they have their own separate routine that they put their own work into. They get trained and skilled to be in competitions that have awards just like football or any ther highschool sports. They have to work for their trophies and in the end theymight be successful might not but stillhave the rules that consider it to be a sport.]]>

This shows that while cheerleading is usually percieved as a non-physical sport, it has become an activity that requires many skills and abilities. Also because of the reasons listed above, cheerleading should be named as an official sport because it is as physically taxing as gymnastics with a required stamina and flexibility. In addition, the modern day cheerleaders &quot;must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player&quot; (director of competitve cheer program). Cheerleading now is a diverse sport with all the skills a cheerleader must have, flexibility, posture, and lastly strenght. So in conclusion, cheerleading should be named as an actual sport because it combines the aspects of many different sports while bringing it together as a whole. Also, many universities reqire high schools and universities to give equal opportunities to both men and women, and cheerleading is a sport which fulfills those set requirement. In fact cheerleading was created by the male student body of the University of Minnesota in 1898, when the pep club chose yell leaders to engage the crowds at football games (International Cheer Organization website). This shows that while cheerleading is commonly thought of as a sport for girls, it was actually originally created by men showing that both genders can participate in the sport. To add on, the former president George W. Bush was a former cheerleader is Massachusetts.This shows that, cheerleading also does stimulate the mind, because a former cheerleader was able to rise up to gain the spot as the president. So, in conclusion cheerleading should be appointed as a sport because it is mentally and physicall taxing.]]>

Cheerleading is becoming more and more competitive at an increasing rate.

You need the strength to lift the cheerleader in the air to perform the pacific flip and you need the athleticism to actually confirm the flip. Also all sports are dangerous and in this case cheerleading is in this category because cheerleading takes practice. Cheerleaders have to practice in order to perform the way that they are supposed to. If there is one mistake in the process their can be severe injury. For example a part of chjeerleading routines is forming a big group with one person on top of the group. In rthis case the drill is to flip the the person on top in the air so that they can do their flip. Well if the person comes down wrong or the group doesn't catch the person correctlty their can be severe injury.]]>

The cheerleader needs to be strong enough to lift their fellow cheerleader and hold them in that positon. A cheerleader has to remember the routines and get them down to a science. There are many sources that say that cheerleading should be seen as a respected sport, such as the Dictionary which describes an athlete as &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleders show many of these characteristics, as they have to be flexible and strong to preform stunts. Though the Title IX regulations states that cheerleding can not be a sport because it is not well organized. Others may say that cheerleading is more organized than other soprts because of the championship events and the highschool and youth camps. Cheerleading is also a popular sport which was played by many famous people like former president of The United States George W. Bush.]]>

Cheerleading is all of the above. The definition of an athlete is, &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot; (Dictionary). To be a cheerleader you have to strive, you have to be hungry for more and more as you win and are crowned champion. What you practice on off the pitch, needs to be carried on into the game scenario. People always downgrade cheerleading because they think that it isn't a sport, but they work just as hard as other athletes in other sports do, sometimes they work even harder than the other athletes ever do. Although cheerleaders work just as hard as other athletes do, there are no rules and regulations like there are in sports such as baseball and football. Without attributes like rules and regulations, people consider cheerleading a girly sport, or even a wimpy one too. In spite of this, cheerleaders have to spend more effort and time, and to also work harder because the things that they have to accomplish take a lot of skill. There are different types of athletes, hard working, determined, and competitive, all of these athletes do, and all of these cheerleaders do. Cheerleading is not what it used to be anymore, now it is very competitive and hard working. The director of a competitive cheerleading stated, &quot;Cheerleading isnt aout cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; its about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Football players spend countless hours of the day working out in the gym, and guess who is right with them, the cheerleaders. A group of people from the American Academy of Pediatrics reported, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive , physically demanding, year-round activity consising of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps&quot;. Brutal competitions have been organized all over the world and many fierce teams have played in them. Despite the fact that cheerleading has turned into a competitive sport, cheerleading was invented in 1898 to engage the crowd during a football teams last game of the season. Cheerleading wasn't meant to become a fierce sport where the participants get too physical, it was meant to get the crowd going. However, the injuries cheerleaders face are much more severe than what other athletes have had to deal with. Cheer leading is just as physical, and involves a lot of hard work.]]>

We have to engage in physically demanding activities, such as quick floor routines that include jumps and leaps, along with tumbling and difficult stunts. Despite what others may believe, cheerleading consists of more than just shaking our pom poms and rooting on the team. Although cheerleading started off as a group of people engaging the crowd, it has become more than that. Requiring the &quot;skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player&quot;, cheerleading can be just as intense as any other sport. Thus, cheerleading should be classified as a sport. Just because cheerleading has not yet been recognized as a sport doesn't mean that it isn't one. If cheerleading had rules and regulations, perhaps it could be classified as a sport. However, the main problem is that many still hold onto the belief that sports are for men, thus anything that women do can't possibly be as hard or serious as men's sports. Any who think that cheerleading is a women's sport would be incorrect because it turns out that the person who invented cheerleading in the first place was a male student at the University of Minnesota. Today, both boys and girls can become a cheerleader. Even our our former president, George W. Bush, was a cheerleader. Clearly, cheerleaders have every right to be labeled as athletes.]]>

According to the director of a competitive cheerleading program, &quot;The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football plater,&quot; (Director). Cheerleaders obviously is not just about cheering on the football payers, but is also a sport itself. In the dictionary, it states that an athelete is &quot;a personwho is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina,&quot; (Dictionary). Every sport requires an athlete, and if cheerleaders are athletes, then cheerleading is a sport. Cheerleading also has many competitions, like many other sports. The director of a competitive cheerleading program declares, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing,&quot; (Director). All the other sports are competitive and have one oponent battling the other. So if cheerleaders compete against oponents, it's a sport. A national cheerlading organization &quot;sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events; highschool cheer camps; youth camps,&quot; (National). If cheerleading is even sponsored by an organization (like other sports), then cheerlading is declared a sport.]]>

American Academy of Pediatrics seems to think so. The American Academy of Pediatrics knows that cheerleading is a dangerous, highly involved, risky sport. In the last century, cheerlading has grown so dramatically that cheerleaders are getting injured more and more every day through their rigorous routines their sport requires. Cheerleaders put the same amount (if not more) of effort into their sport as a skilled football player. Like many countless sports, cheerleading revolves around the need for constant stamina, agility, and strength. Cheerleading was first invented by men in the 1890s at the University of Minnesota to pump up the crowd during football games. Even former U.S. President George W. Bush, was head cheerleader in his senior year of high school!]]>

Cheerleading covers all of these requirements. People may think that cheerleading is just for fun and there's no real competition, but that's not true. Cheerleaders practice all year long, and are coached. Their main goal is to win and compete against other teams. Like the director of a competitve chearleading program said, cheerleading isn't just about cheering anymore; it's about competing. Also, cheerleading is nation wide and very popular. Former president George W. Bush, served as head cheerleading of Phillips Academy during his senior year of high school. There are camps, competitions, and championship events that are organized for cheerleading. Cheerleading has become so popular that the American Academy of Pediatrics said cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it can be taken more seriously by sports governing bodies and school athletic departments. If they officially declared cheerleading a sport, they would have to get the right equipment and space for them to practice. This would also decrease the amount of injuries from student athletes each year.]]>

Bases on these requirmets of a sport, cheerleadign is a sport. They have coaches who hold practices, and they have a copetition season. &quot;Cheerleading isnt about cheerign for the football and basketball teams anymore; its about competeing. The girls and boys who cheer must have skills of a gymast, the grace of a dancer, and the strenght of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms&quot; says a director of a competitive cheeleadign program. So if gymnastics, dance and football are considered sports than so should cheerleading because it requires the skills of all of those sports put together. They need strength to lift each other. They need the skill of a gymnats, flexiblity and tricks. And the grace of a dancer which is very hard to have. The dictonary says that and athlete is &quot; a person who is trained or skilled in exercies, sports or games requiring physical strength, agility or stamina&quot;. Well based on that definition cheerleaders are atheletes they must train to do tricks and stunds, and they are very skilled at what they do. They exersises and while in their cheer rutuine they use physical strength to lift, agility to flip and stamina to countine throughtout their long rutuine. So if atheletes play sports theirfore, if cheerleaders are athletes than cheerleading is a sport.]]>

Any person who is considered an athlete is someone considered in a sport of some kind. The director of the Competitive cheerleading program even says that &quot;cheerleading isnt about cheering for football and basketball players.&quot; she even goes on to say that cheerleaders need the skills of a gymnist and the strength of a football player. if the activity of cheer is just as physically demaining as other sports, why cant it be consided a sport?]]>

Cheerleaders have since grown in intrest and in sport, now having it's own organization. Sponsors from the reigon and from national competions help fund classes. There are cheer camps and youth camps to provide help for the cheerleaders-to-be. The fact that if cheerleading is a sport has been debated on for years. In 2010 in Connecticut it was stated not a sport because it &quot;needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport&quot; according to Title IX regulations. Under Title IX, however, it is required that both boys and girls require equal ammounts of sports in school. Should cheer really be banned then?]]>

I also belevied that you needed some for of sport/extracuricular to grauate, and President George W. Bush graduated, and yet he did cheerleading, so how could he have graduated if cheerleading was not a sport. I also understand that it needs more organization, yet it is clearly organized with having regular practices and competitions, so I fail to see how this is unorganized. Cheerleading also requires great skill which means it must be organized for the players to have and compete in competitions. As the matter of having a defined season and having practices, there are obviously practices because then how could off the moves that they do during games, and to have the practices you need to have a season to hold them in, so that means there must be practices and a season.]]>

As said in the modern dictionary an athlete is&quot; a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or ganes requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot;. My next reasoning is that most boys and girls who are cheerleaders have skills of a gymnast , that means that they have what it takes to be a cheerleader. My explation for this is infact from the Director of a competitve cheerleading program, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The boys and girls who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah rah rah'and shaking pom poms. Also cheerleading is co-ed, that means that both guys and girls get to be cheerleaders. The reason for this is that well, Cheerleading was invented by male students at the university of Minnesota in 1898; members of the &quot;pep club&quot; elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the croud durring a football team's last game of the season.

Sports do'nt have to contain running, throwing, or tackling they can be as simple as picking someone else up. First of all cheerleading is an actual sport because the &quot;Dictionary&quot; says under &quot;athlete&quot; that an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excersises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; A cheerleader requires flexibility and physical strength to attempt stunts like a human pyramid, and therefore cheerleading is to be considered a sport. Another reason why I believe that cheerleading is an actual sport is because &quot;Title IX regulations&quot; require universities to offer equal athletic oppurtunities to both male and female&quot; also under &quot;Title IX&quot; it says &quot;a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization.&quot; Cheerleading is a competitive &quot;sport&quot; that contains physical activity, competitions, coaches, and practices. It may not be as physical as other sports but it is more physical then some sports like &quot;Golf&quot; for example, and therefore cheerleading is a &quot;sport&quot;.]]>

When you cheer you must lift 100-150 pound people over you head by yourself or sometimes with others. You also must do backflips, frontflips, and tumbles. Those all using agility. In the dictonary it states that an athelete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercise, sports, or games requireing physical strenth, agility, or stamina.&quot; When we cheer, we are trained and practice our routines. We also use physical strenth and stamina. If you say that cheerleading is not a legitimate sport give me reasons. Tell me why people do not think cheerleading is legit. It uses more strenth and agility than most sport I know. some people say that cheerelading is just a hobby and thats all, but George W. Bush was a cheerleader and he became the president of the United States. When I cheer I go as fast and as hard as I can. That takes effort. Sometimes I see why you can say that is not a sport, but trust me, if you see me and my team your mind will be changed. Maybe some of the people you watched just don't care. They dont try the show off or be the best. Somepeople might just do it because they think you don't do anything all you do is sit down and text. Somepeople might laugh or chuckle a when they ask if im in any sports and I say cheerleading. Well thats why I'm here, to change people opinion about the sport. This is what I do.]]>

The dictionary`s definition of an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical stregth, agility, or stamina.&quot; and cheerleaders fit that discription so they are athletes. The American academy of Pediatrics sates in a report that cheerleading has changed into something other than just cheering and dancing at football games.Also that it should be designated a sport so it would be subjected to rules and regulations. A court district court case in 2010 ruled that cheerleading was not a sport becuase it needed a better orginization and clearly defined rules. In cheerleading there is no need for rules the cheerleadrs come up with a performance and a chant. Cheaerleading has become a competitive activity they have natoinal competitions and championships like evry other sport. Goerge W Bush was a cheerleader in his senoir year in high school. He should be asked about his opinion aboutthis subject.]]>

American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries stated that &quot; over the last century, cheerleading has envolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leapd and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athetes in the air.&quot; We also have to be flexiable as any gymnast to preform stunts such as back handsprings. We are constintly doing leaps, flips, tumbles, and flyining throught the air. We use that to our advantage when it comes down to it actually. If we set our minds to something, we end up doing it. This is why cheerleading is a sport, so if you ever need someone to debate with, and if it considers us debating if cheerleading is a sport I'm the man you can call.]]>

What I mean by cheerleading needing better organization and clearly defined rules is that in a 2010 connecticut district course that ruled cheerleading said it was not a sport because it needed better organization and clearly defined rules . I donot know about having better organization but the only clearly defined rules are that you have to play at your high school football and basketball games. Next is tht in the dictionary it says tht an athlete is &quot; a person who is trained or skilled in exercises , sports , or games requiring physical strength. Sure you might exercise every now and then and you can have similar capabilitys as an athlete but even an athlete cant or can do what you do, but you still dont play or participate in games you just dance and shake pom pom's in games. Finally what i mean by cheerleading being a club is that you dont compete versus other cheerleaders you hust cheer your team not all the time just when necessary.]]>

They have to have stamina at ceer competions, have to be trained to perform stunts, and they have to be tremendously strong to lift their team mates. In fact, cheerleading is one of the toughest sports out there. You don't have to throw a 100+ pound ball in football, nor do you have to be able to flip only using some girls hands for support. Football is considered one of the toughest sports out there, but, should it be? In my opinion I think that cheerleading is much harder, for the physical things your body has to perform. Another reason that cheerleading is a true sport is that cheerleaders have coaches, practice, tournaments, and have a defined season just like all other sports do. To say cheerleading isn't a sport is not giving it enough credit for how hard it really is.]]>

This goes so much with cheerleading because they need strength to pick each other up and do flips or a humman pyramid. Another reason why cheerleading is a true sport is because they exersice every day to get better at things and moves or tricks. They spend so much time together working out ther muscles so they could get fit. last cheerleading is a sport because whats a sport with no teamwork/ well cheerleading work together to make there tricks to work out just fine and all they needed was teamwork .

They have to be a strong as a football player, have the grace of a dancer, and must have the skills of a gymnast. They are not just yelling and supporting the home team, they are performing stunts that they have practiced over and over again like simple things like leaps and jumps. Alll the way to complex stunts like a pyramid or tossing athletes in the air. Secondly, cheerleading has a season and competitions just like any other sports does. It is all year round and there is competions held for schools to compete against schools.]]>

Also cheerleading is a sport because of all the jumping and physical strength and dancing. A quote about cheerleading is &quot;cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more then yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; If cheerleading is not a sport then sports like wrestling or golf or nascar are not sports. The national cheerleading organization sponsers regional and national competitions and championship events; high school cheer camps; youth camps. Even former president George W. Bush was a head cheerleader of the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898; members of the pep club elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crowd during football games during the football team's last game of the season. Trust me when i tell you cheerleading is in fact a sport]]>

At my highschool my cheerleading team and I constantly compete with the other team's cheerleading squad trying to out due them in cheer, dancing, and sometimes flips or jumps, while trying to motivate the crowd and team. Cheerleading is just as competive as any other sport. &quot;Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah rah' and shaking pompoms&quot; says a director of a competitive cheeleading program. Cheering has evolved into a very competive sport, some athletes from other sports, such as basketball or football, couldn't do some of the things cheeleaders could in there normal routines. As a cheerleader, I know we are athletes. We perform fast-paced floor touines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and compex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes into the air. Therefore, Cheerleading should definetly be known as a true sport. I can understand that when you hear the word &quot;cheerleader&quot; you think of a whole bunch of snobby girly girls waving their pompoms and cheering on the sideline of their school sports event. However, I'm a male and according to the website of international cheer organization, cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898; members of the &quot;pep club&quot; elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crowd during the football team's last game of the season. Plus, Cheeleading isn't just about getting the crowd's blood pumping a local sports event, many teams travel around the U.S. competing in multiple competitions every year. Further more, cheerleading isn't just for girls, most people think the guys in cheerleading are a little feminim or girly at times, but I'll let you know that one of our great presidents was a head cheerleader during his senior year in highschool. Former president Gearge W. Bush, served as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. One of our best leaders I'd bet would even say that cheerleading is a true sport. I believe that cheerleading is a legitimate sport. we fit the description of an athlete, we travel around the U.S. to different towns and compete for first place at cheerleading competitions, we work as a team to put on a show for ourselfs and the crowd watching, just as any other sport would. It's about time we gained our respect for being an organized, true sport.]]>

You are still required to have the same amount of exercise and strength and agility. Cheerleaders work just as hard as any other athlete out there.

The definition states, &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; As a cheerleading, someone would have to practice and train several times each week to successfully perform the stunts they attempt. In many of their cheers, they lift up multiple people to create the image of a pyramid. To lift someone up above your head, it takes extreme physical strength, just as the definiton of an athlete states in the dictionary. They also perform many cheers that require them to move and run quickly. To do so, they need agility to be quick, and stamina to keep going. This fits perfectly with the definition of an athlete in the dictionary. Cheerleading has also evolved into an intense sport. American Academy of Pediatrics reported, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity.&quot; If the cheerleading groups compete for awards, trophies, and titles, as mentioned by the American Academy of Pediatrics, then it deserves to be considered a sport.

Cheerleading was invented by male students at the University Of Minnesota in 1898. Members of the pep club voted &quot;yell leaders&quot; to have the crowd be engaged during the game. The &quot;yell teams&quot; would assemble during the teams last football game of the season. Then once the &quot;yell teams&quot; became known after a couple decades they came to be named as cheerleaders. Now when you think of Cheerleaders, You are probably thinking of beautiful women dressed inapropriatley. Also, Cheerleaders sound more like what a girl would do. You have to remember that males invented cheerleading (yell teams). Not girls. Thats why cheerleading was taken &quot;over&quot; by girls. Then once college came around then cheerleading became a male and female sport. The sport became such a hit that it became an Olympic sport that had a lot of potential. Many people created sponsors and camps. The camps helped little ones in kindergarten/first grade to then pursue there dreams and become more engaged in there favorite sport at a young age. Cheerleading also helped increase the percentage of team sports. Football became a nationwide sport. Same with soccer, baseball, hockey, etc. cheerleading helped the Seahawks win the Superbowl the year 2014. Our stadium reach 124 decibels. Thats just the crowd thats there at the stadium. Imagine howmany people are screaming at home and at partys. Cheerleaders have been known for there athletic abillity. When I say athletic abillity, I dont mean the abillity to run and catch a ball. I mean &quot; a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; If you are a cheerleader then you have the abillity to do multiple sports because you have to be strong, flexible, and so forth. I am sure of that any cheerleader should have the abillity to do any sport from hocke to pickleball to sking.]]>

Would you say that to toss a human in the air, you would need certain skills? Like physical strength to hold someone on your shoulders, or an ability to do the splits. What about stacking yourselves in a pyramid, wouldn't you need stanima? People may argue that cheerleading is not a sport, but I am here to say otherwise. Cheerleading takes some real effort. To be a good cheerleader, you need to have some types of strengths in every department. At lease thats what a director of a competative cheerleading program thinks. They say &quot;the girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; and it's true. It's been said that to be a sport, cheerleading needs to have more rules. What rules? Cheerleading is perfectly fine the way it is. There may also be some arguments that a sport is something that both the male and female gender could do. But people often see cheerleading as a girl's sport. Did you know that former president George W. Bush was the head cheerleader at his high school? He is a guy, and he became pretty succesful too. Cheerleading is also sometimes thought to be simple and girls do it only because they don't have to work that hard. Tell me if you had to jump around in corrdination with a bunch of other girls,either hold or be held in a formation of a pyramid, would you be sweating, and panting? Gasping for air and water at the same time? If that doesn't sould like working hoar, then I don't know what does.]]>

Cheerleading is a very competitive sport and competing is the number one objective of a cheer team. A director of a competitive cheerleading program declares, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and bots who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Cheerleading may have been established to engage crowds in football games, but it has become much more than that. The American Academy of Pediatrics reports, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evoloved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunds, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; There are not many sports more competitive than cheerleading out there, or that demand as much as cheering does, which is why it has to be classified as a sport. Aditionally under Title IX, in order for something to be classified a sport it has to have coaches, practices, competitions, and a governing organization. Well cheerleading certainly has coaches, as we quoted one of them earlier, they have many physically demanding practices, to become the best they can be, and their governing body is the National cheerleading organization, whcih sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events. Cheerleading fulfills every requirement to be a sport, so we have to classify it as one. The American Academy of Peadiatrics reports, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulation set forth by sports governing bodies.... and school athletic departments.&quot; Cheerleading fulfills all the requirements for a sport, it is certainly about competing with others and it demands more endurance than most things classified as sports too, for all these reasons, it is imperative we classify cheerleading as a sport.]]>

Also athletes are needed to play sports, cheerleaders being considered athletes renders cheerleading a sport. Plus over the last few years, cheerleading has begun to turn into, &quot;...competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbiling, and complex stunts, suvh as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; (American Acadamy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries) Even an average football player does not practice and play football year-round, which further demonstrates how cheerleaders have to work just as hard, and sometimes harder than people in other sports. Football players do not have to do such a large variety of excercises, like stunts or tumbling; however cheerleaders do these on a regular basis.]]>

All they do, you may say, is shake pompoms and resite the team's poetry. I say to you, cheerleaders &quot;must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player,&quot; to do &quot;floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes into the air.&quot; If you think cheerleaders are snoty, popular girls, think again. Our 55th president, George W. Bush, was a head cheerleader of Phillips Acadamy in Andover, Massachusetts, during his senior year of high school. This is the same man who was president during 9/11/01. And cheerleading was not organized by girls, either. It was organized by a group of University of Minnisota guys in 1898 for pep rallies.]]>

The Dictionary defines an athlete as: &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleaders must be trained to perform their routines and drills at games; they display physical strength, agility and stamina throughout cheer sessions. Occasionally cheerleaders, like athletes, receive injuries from participating in the demanding stunts and jumps performed by every cheer brigade. In fact, the American Academy of Pedatrics has reported that &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot;]]>

Most people consider cheerleading as a meathod for getting the crowd rild-up, and is mainly an activity just for females. However, cheerleading is a sport because it is physically demanding, competetive, and has coaches, practices and &quot;game matches.&quot; Many think cheerleading isn't very hard. All you do is shake some pom-poms and yell 'rah, rah, rah.' It is much more difficult than that. Cheerleading involves many different skills. As the American Aacadmy of Pediatrics put it: &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramic building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; Therefore, cheerleading is very physically demanding and hard. Also, many will argue that cheerleading isn't competetive. It lacks competition, &quot;game matches.&quot; This is also untrue. As one director of a competitive cheerleading program once put it: &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Also the Title 4 regulations &quot;require universities to offer equal athletic opportunities to both men and women; under Title 4, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main tole must be to compete,&quot; all of which cheerleading has.

The definition of an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot;. Cheerleading possesses all of these qualities! Cheerleading includes round-offs and back-flips, which has the foundation of agility. Cheerleading also possesses the strength needed to be part of a pyramid. Secondly, cheerleading is not only for girls. One of our presidents, George W. Bush, was the head cheerleader of Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts during his senior year of high school. Also, cheerleading was invented by not female but male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898.

Even the American Academy of Pediatrics say &quot;Cheerleading should be assigned a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies... and school athletic departments&quot;. Training as a cheerleader takes more skill and flexability than most sports. The director of a competitive cheerleading program proclaimed that cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball team anymore; it is about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skill of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling and shaking pompoms. This sport was created by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898; who were members of the pep club and yell leaders to engage the crowd during football team's last game of the season. Furthermore, Title IX regulations require universities to offer equal athletic oppotunities to both men and women; under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; it's main goal must be to compete. Nevertheless, president George W. Bush, served as a head cheerleader at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, duyring his senior year of high school.]]>

As a cheerleader at highschool we have to be as strong as a football player to lift our teammates to create a pyramid, and as flexible as a gymnast to perform stunts like back handsprings. In the Dictionary the defitition of athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excerises, sports, or games requiring physical strngth, or stamina.&quot; Another crediable source is a competitive cheerleader Director program-&quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have skills of gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot;]]>

Cheerleaders have to do the same things and excersizes as athletes. They have to have the grace and feelings of a dancer, they also have to have the strength of any football player in order to pull any stunt. Therefore cheerleading should be considered a sport. Cheerlaeders should also be considered athletes. They go through everything to be who they are. Like any other athletes,cheerleaders go through hard times, for example injuries, they break legs, arms, tear muscles, but do you see them give up.Even if they get more hurt , they still try and try in order to be satisfied with what they went through to get where they are. In almost any sport you heard of everyone gets hurt. Usually you always see them try and try to get better to get back to there game, in other words, they never give up.

I agree with the student because it states in the notes taken from the dictionary. An athlete is someone in sports and someone who is trained or skilled, and from the dictionary description it shows that a cheer leader is an athlete. It does not directly state it, I know, but a cheer leader/ cheer leaders would and do fit the description. I also agree with the student because not only do they compete to win as other athletes do in other sports, but as other sports it has rules and regulations. I mean, if it is not a sport then, why would it need rules? Also, they have coaches as other sports do and as other sports it is national. They still compete and if you have to compete then it is obviously a sport.]]>

Cheerleaders do plenty of that. They have to excersize and train just as much as a football player to get their jumps, cartwheels, splits, and cartwheels perfect. You need strength, agility, and stamina to do this sport. Second, The american Pediatrics report, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is a subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies.&quot; Doctors, who examine athletes all the time, also believe Cheerleading is a sport. Also, the Director of a competitive cheerleading program states, &quot;Cheerleadinmg isn't about cheering for football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing.&quot; Just like every other sport, Cheerleading also has competition, which is another reason it IS a sport. Third, Some famous people have been cheerleaders. Our past president, George W. Bush, served as head cheerleaders of Phillip Academy in Andover, Massachusstts, during his senior year of high school. cheerleading was also invented by male students. Even though it only started as &quot;yell leaders&quot;, the sport has developed so much over time. It deserves to be recognized.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Cheerleading is a sport because it requires much athleticism, strength, agility, and endurance. Many highschool sports such as basketball, football, and soccer also require these skills, so why can't cheerleading be among them? For example, the American Acedemy of Pediatrics reports that, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity...&quot; This claims that cheerleading is just as difficult as any other true sport. To be a cheerleader, it requires hard work and strength, like any other school sport. Cheerleading requires a lot of work, but people can also be seriously injured while doing this activity. Cheerleading is just as dangerous as any other sport. Sometimes when people are discussing this issue, there's usually at least one person that says, &quot;Cheerleading isn't as dangerous and hard as football!&quot; or something like that. Actually, it is. The American Academy of Pediatrics report that, &quot;[cheerleading] consist[s] of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes into the air.&quot; Obviously, there are many opportunities in a routine where a cheerleader can get hurt. Also, many gymnasts go into cheer after learning gymnastics, which is also a sport! Not only is cheerleading dangerous, but it is also organized and popular among many different organizations. Many people say that cheerleading is not as organized as other sports, but it is more complicated than they think. There are many locations where people can learn the sport of cheerleading. The national cheerleading organization consists of sponsors, regional and national competitions, championship events, highschool cheer camps, and youth camps. These are all arguments that cheerleading is as important as any other sport! They have all these organizations about cheerleading, so clearly it is important. Next, many people believed that cheerleading shouldn't become a sport because it isn't organized enough, or doesn't have enouth rules. In reality, cheerleading is very complicated. Competitions require people to learn certain routines, stunts, etc. Cheering is extremely organized and in fact, other sports rely on them too! Cheerleading is equally important as any other sport.]]>

What it means to be an athlete is someone who is trained or skilled and that is what it means to be a cheerleader. In cheerleading it's not all about fun and games. Without rules and regulation just like other sports there have been several reported by the America Acamdamy of Pediatrics. As said from the Director of a competitive cheerleading, &quot;Cheerleading isnt about cheering for football and basketball teams anymore;its about cometing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah rah rah' and shaking ppompoms.&quot; cheerleaders are pretty tough. Cheerleading is not just for schools, its an organization. Cheerleading all started back in 1898 at the University of Minnesota when a male student who was a member of the &quot;pep club&quot; ellected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crowd on the teams last football game. Not only that, but there are National cheerleading orginization that help sponsor national and regional competions and also championship events. Now there are several high school cheer camps and youth camps that support cheeerleading. Even George W. Bush was a cheerleader during his senior year of high school.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[I believe that cheerleading is a legitimate and challenging sport. After doing some research, I learned that the true deffinition of an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot; Cheerleading involves all three of these skillsets. The cheerleaders must be strong to lift eachother in human pyramids, have agility to perform handsprings and other gymnast like tricks, and stamina to be able to entertain an audience for many hours while the game is being played. Another reson why cheerleading should be considered a sport is because there are many regional and national cheerleading competitions throughout the u.s. The directer of a competitive cheerleading program said &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah rah rah' and shaking pompoms.With this set of skills and the fact that there are many cheering competitions around the country should be an indicator that cheering should be considered a sport. Many national figures have the same opinion about cheerleading as I do. President George Bush, in fact, served as head cheerleader in his high school durin his senior year, in Andover, Massechussets. The American Academy of Pediatrics stated &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitve, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnast-style tumbling,mand comlex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes into the air. Many people believe that cheerleading should be considered a sport and I agree. In conclusion, I believe that cheerleading should be considered a legitimate sport because there are many national and regional cheerleading tournaments, many national figures support it, and the strength, agility, and stamina required to cheer should indicate that cheerleading deserves to be a sport.]]>

The Title IX regulations claim that a sport must have coaches, practices and competitions. A sport's main goal must be to compete. Cheerleading is everything a sport claims to be. Cheerleaders have coaches to teach them their routines, they have practices to make sure they are ready for each game and they even have organizations that sponsor regional and national competitions. A cheerleader's main goal isn't just to compete, but it also aims to support unity during school and after school. Cheerleading is a sport. Strength, agility, endurance and perserverance make an athlete. When people think of athletes they think of people who play sports like football and soccer, but does anyone think of cheerleading? I do. Cheerleading is a sport, and sports require athleticism. If you think that cheerleaders aren't athletes then I will tell you that you're wrong. Cheerleaders have all the qualties of an athlete. They require strength to lift their fellow cheerleaders in the air, flexibilty to accomplish many stunts and endurance to make it through the games. Cheerleading isn't just yelling chants; it's leading a group of people, competing to win and being a sport.]]>

The American Academy of Pediatrics reported on cheerleading stating that &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes into the air.&quot; A normal person without training and athleticism could not accomplish these tasks. The American Academy of Pediatrics continued in saying that &quot;cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports govrening bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; [Biediger v. Quinnipiac University] was a 2010 district court case in Conneticutat that ruled that cheerleading was not a sport, according to Title IX regulations. That decision was upheld in 2012 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which stated that cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rulesbefore it could be considered a sport. I can agree with this, but cheerleading is still a true sport to me. A director of a competitive cheerleading program said, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it is about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnist, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot;]]>

At a district court case in Conneticuit though, the ruling was that cheerleading was not a sport.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[I believe that cheerleading is a sport because it takes all of the physical strength and agility as it does for other sports. People may not think cheerleading is a sport because there is no competative factor to it, but fishing is not competative and it is still a sport. cheerleadiong needs more rules to be an official sport, but it may be an unofficial sport to alot of people. A former president George W. Bush served as a cheerleader in Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, during his senior year of high school. Plenty of people gain courage and strength from cheerleading, because they work together with eachother to beat the other teams cheerleaders. Cheerleading is a sport for both men and women, because cheerleading was actually invented by a group of male students in 1898. Cheerleading is a competative sport because there is a sponsored event where teams compete against each other to be the number one cheer squad. Cheerleading is a fun sport for people of all shapes and sizes, and even for men and women! People think of cheerleading as a function that is pointless and not needed, but it supports the players on the team they are supporting. Even professional teams have cheerleaders like the Dallas Cowboys, and other sports teams. Even if they dont make cheerleading an official sport i will be happy, as long as they keep it in the schools to support their team. So that was why i believe cheerleading is a sport, so please consider making it official!]]>

A cheerleader fits the definition of an athlete so cheerleading should be considered a sport because it contains athletes. Cheerleading has also been described as a competitive, physically demanding sport. For these reasons no one should doubt that cheerleading is a sport. The sport of cheerleading can be considered as competitve and phyically demanding as other sports, so it should be called a sport as well. Since cheer leading has been a popular sport and is not just used as a way of cheering for teams, but now as a competeive game, it should be able to be called a sport. Now that cheerleading has become much more than just shaking pom poms, it has become an activity that requires training. This training is very hard, because cheering has become competitve, and requires certain standards of grace, flexibility, and strength. This training for cheerleaders requires as much physical activiy as football training would becasue the cheerleaders need the sam ammount of strength. This sport has had many important people contribute to the long history such as former president George W. Bush. Cheerleading should become a sport beacuse it includes all the factors of a normal sport the only reason it has not become a sport is most likelu because of former stereotype and people aren't aware of the actual physical activity cheerleading takes.]]>

Cheerleading is a mix of many sports such as, gymnastics, dance, and football. For example a cheerleader must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dyancer, and the strength of a football player. If cheer is a mixture of three activities that we call sports, wouldn't that make it a mega sport? As cheer develops, it becomes less and less about cheering at school functions and more about winning competitons and trophies. Cheer has a season just as any other sport does and because of that it has many impressive sponsors such as the National cheerleading organization. Practice, hard work, and determination is what is needed to produce both a winning cheerleader and a cheer team. Those are characteristics that are voiced in many other sprots too. Many people don't consider cheerleading a sport because they don't realize the entire complexity of the sport. A cheerleader must put his/her body through vigorious workouts and positions just to stay healthy, tight, strong, and limber. It isn't just jumping up and down, twirling pompoms and shouting. It's applying blood, sweat, and tears to be the best and to beat the rest.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[First, cheerleading consists of many separate skills. To cheerlead, girls and boys must be talented in more than one area. The director of a competitive cheerleading program described people that cheer as having the grace of a dancer, strength of a football player and the talents of a gymnast. It is already hard enough to build the strength to be a football player, let alone train for the talents of a gymnast and work for the grace of a dancer. Cheerleading takes lots of hard work and dedication. Second, cheerleading has developed over the years to become something very different then what it was when it began in 1898. The website of international cheer organization says, &quot;cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898; members of the &quot;pep club&quot; elected &quot;yell leader&quot; to engage the crowd during the football team's last game of the season&quot; What started as a club, that was only used to encourage a sport, evolved into something with new ideas, rules and regulations. The American Academy of Pediatrics said, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastic style tumbling, and complex stunts.&quot; This shows that cheerleading is much more intense than what the founders had in mind. Even if it didn't begin as a sport, it has definetely changed into a very competitive and demanding one.]]>

Title IX regulations say sports must have coaches, practice, oppertutinies for men and women, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization. Cheerleading has all of those things so does that mean it should be a sport, because I think so. The Director of a competitive cheerleading program explains that cheerleading isn't about cheering on the teams anymore; but competing, the cheerleaders must have the skills of a gymnast, grace of a dancer and strength of a football player. The American Academy of pediatrics reported on the number of cheerleading injuries, they said that cheerleading should be a sport so that it's subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies and school athletic departments. Doctors even think cheerleading should be concidered a sport because of the number of carless injeries that are happening to todays youth. They also say that over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramaticlly into a competitive physically demanding year round activity that concists of fast pase floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics style tubling and complex stunts.]]>

His claim is a very debatable topic and I believe that this is a very good claim. He has very good sources that will help him support his claim. Many people have been wondering if cheerleading is considered a sport. He has a narrow claim and it is not too broad. There are some things he can improve though. He could be a little more specific, like what type of school; middle school, high school.... He could also be less opinionative. Instead of using, &quot;I believe,&quot; he could use, &quot;Well cheerleading is a sport and I have the reasons and evidence to support this,&quot; and he could go on, and on about his topic.]]>

To be a cheerleader you have to be able to lift people and to create cool human pyramids and other human designs. People's minds don't think about how a cheerleader does that, they just look at it and think that is it cool. The cheerleaders on the base of the pyramid can't be any old girly girl cheerleader, they have to be strong in order to support the body weight of the girls on the top levels. Cheerleaders also entertain people by doing dance routines and gymnast acts. They have to have the agility and bounce of a dancer in order to perform a dance routine at half time of that game everyone is at. Cheerleaders have to have the quickness and flexibility of a gymnast because doing the splits and tumbling isn't easy if you aren't flexible. If gymnastics is a sport, and cheerleading is a combination of gymnastics and dance, then there is no reason that cheerleading isn't a sport.]]>

Im pretty sure that a cheerleader has the defination of an athlete. Cheerleading takes a lot of skill to do and a lot of exerises. If you do something wrong it is simple for you to get injured. In any sport you can get injured, so if you can get injured badly in cheer then it should be a sport. There are also famous cheerleaders that cheer for a job. It's just like a football player that plays football for a job. Even president George W. Bush was a cheerleader during his senior year and if you asked him then I'm pretty sure he would say it was a sport too. There are many cheer organizations for cheerleaders and if that doesn't tell you something then you must be messed up. Cheerleading is a sport.]]>

Cheerleading is definitely harder then it looks. Being a cheerleader is like playing 3 sports: A gymnast,a dancer and a football player.

Many people also think that cheerleading is only a girl sport. That is not true and many boys even do this as well. Even President George W.

When people dont consider cheerleading as a sport, they need to watch a football practice and a cheerleading practice. Both teams require speed, agiltiy, and they both are physically demanding. In football you are trying to tackle the opposing player, when in cheerleading, you are throwing a team member in the air and catching them. Cheerleading is a demanding sport just like football and all other sports. Just like every sport, people can be injured competing in cheerleading. Most people think cheerleaders just stand and shout encouragment to the players, but now that is not the case. Cheerleaders are throwing people in the air, holding a person above them who is only on one foot, and countless other tricks. One wrong move and many people can be injured.

Cheerleading involves all those things so it makes it a true sport. For example, to do stunts you have to be very flexible use strength at the same time. Or lifting someone up to the point they're standing on your shoulders/ back uses much strength. Theres alot of argument over whether cheerleading is an actual sport because in 2012, they chose that it wasnt because of the unorganization invoved and they had no regulations. After that, the IX regulations were that for it to be considered a sport, the team mudt have at least one coach, practices, competitions, and organization.]]>

It clearly states that an athlete is someone who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. Cheerleading involves many, if not all of the things described in this definition. Also another reason listed would be because it is physically demanding. also it is a competetive, year- round activity that consists of fast-paced floor routines with lifts, jumps, and other stunts. People who must cheer should have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player all in one]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[In my factual-based opinion, there is no reason cheerleading wouldn't be considered a sport. Cheerleading is an extremely physically demanding activity; almost more than other activities that've never had their status as a 'sport' questioned. Most of the exercises cheerleaders perform are cardiovascular as well as strength-building, which makes them undoubtedly strenuous. The arguments against the idea that cheerleading is a sport tend to be politically incorrect as well as poorly supported. Cheerleading certainly takes strength, as supporting several bodies with your arms is not for the weak. Lifting human beings repetitively until you can do it without a second thought may require more strength than that of a football player. As far as cardio, running, jumping, and even flipping in the air definitely raise your heart rate, especially when done for over 30 minutes, and most cheer practice sessions are over an hour long. The combination of these two undoubtedly make the average cheerleader extremely in-shape, agile, and strong. Using my previous argument, cheerleading certainly possesses the traits of a sport. The arguments against the sport are typically poorly formed and/or executed; seemingly all of them coming from those with closed minds and a lack of civilized discussion skills. Most people who argue against it believe that cheerleading is just yelling and flailing around, when in reality, it takes grace, precision, balance, and strength.]]>

People consider cheerleading a competitive sport now, and people even consider it an official sport. It's not just for girls, either. Boys, like the student, cheer for their school as well, and they consider it to be fun. Even the clear definition of the word athlete can back up the claim that cheerleading is an athletic sport. However, some people don't consider cheerleading as a sport. It was even &quot;a district court case in Conneticut, which ruled out that cheerleading is not a sport.&quot; They say that sports need coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a government organization. They also say that in order to be a sport, cheerleading needs better organization and clearly defined rules. So no matter how you look at it, you can't officially say that cheerleading's a sport or not.]]>

Also in football you must have speed if you are the reciever because you have to be able to run the ball and avoid people tackling you. In track you must have stamina because you are constantly running. You must be able to run far distances without running out of breath or slowing down. Same for cheerleading. They must be able to do constant backflips and frontflips without stopping or messibng up just because they get tired after five or ten minutes. Finally you must have agility in cheerlaeading. Just like gymnastics! You need to be able to flip, spin, etc. You also have to very flexible. So this is why cheerleading is a sport too.]]>

You must have a lot of strength in order to be able to lift one another. You also must have good agility and endurance to ensure you do not get tired during a competition. Stamina plays a major role in being a cheerleader because you must be able to hold your cheer mates up for a long time. Cheerleading is also a very dangerous sport because there are many stunts. These stunts can cause you to fall from tall lengths. Some of the floor routines can be very risky as well such as, back- flips, front- flips, and round- offs. Many people may be embarrassed to claim cheerleading as a sport, but it actually is. It takes a lot more time, dedication, strength, and skill as you may think.]]>

Also you need to have alethicism to be a cheerleader aswell. Plus you dont have to be a female to be in cheer. It was said that a male came up with the sport in 1898. Cheering is more than just shaking pom poms and screaming and yelling! Though it is says that there are tons of injuries do to stunts that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be a sport. Cheering is also a competitive organization. Sponsors can claim the team and support them. While supporting the team they are also getting their name or their brand out! There are alot of famous people you dont know of as being a cheerleader, such as George W. Bush, he cheered for Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusette. He cheered during his senior year of high school!]]>

If cheerleaders have to basically be able to do all the things a gymnast can do then, why is gymnastics considered a sport but cheerleading isn't? Over the years, cheerleading has advanced more and more to where it is not just baout cheering for a team but now they are competing. Cheerleaders must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. President George W. Bush was head cheerleader of Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts during his senior year. The American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries- &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.]]>

So in that defintion, cheerleading would fit into that category. Because the have practice every day, they are training in different exercizes each day. They also compete almost every weekend. However that is just depending on the cheer team. The sport also requires agility, stamina, and strength in order to participate. They have to train like this in order to be able to do hard lifts, and tossing teamates in the air. The Title IX regulations suggest they have coaches. Other sports such as Football, Baseball, and Basketball all have one or more coaches as well as cheerleading does. People say they have the grace of a dancer, the strength of a football player and its more than just shouting words. It has evolved greatly over the years.]]>
