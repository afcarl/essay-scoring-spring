Paying off a loan is part of recieving an education, it comes with the package, and knowing how to be able to manage their expenses to be able to pay off loans is an essential decision one should take before they enlist into a college. Where will those loan expenses go if the students recieve an amnesty? Clearly they do not simply disapear. Those payments will become endless taxes for the people and the students and will end up paying not only their education but others aswell. So in the end it is better to pay your own education rather than your own and a hundred more students.]]>

If students get help and are just let off with paying their tuition, they will think that similar loans in the future will also be forgiven. Students would start blowing their money on frivolous items, instead of using it for their tuition. Anyways, most of the student loans are paid by US taxpayers not the actual students or their families. So if they are already getting most of their loan from others, how much more help do they really need? It's not necessary to give them an education without any cost.

If loan debts are forgiven, some students will money on frivolous items and not tuition. About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans.

They will expect future debt to be forgiven as well which will lead to more severe college debt. The students notes also state that college students will spend money freely on unnecessary items and not on school and leave the taxpayers with the debt, spending it on tuition and not on the students and families themselves. I don't agree with any of the student's statements, if the debt is cleared, most students will pay for rent, food, gasoline, and any other necessities, it's all up to that individual. I believe the colleges should clear the debts and not leave taxpayers with the responsiblity to pay, that way tax money will still go to students and their families.]]>

Removing that responsiblity, they claim, would promote reckless behavior. Students would take advantage of the colleges' generotisy, spending loan money on items other than tuition. This would increase the amount of debt they owe, and, since the students have no obligation to repay loans, would increase the amount of loans taken in a vicious cycle. More debt would mean more loans would mean more debt. Already, 5/6 of all student debt is in federal money; U.S taxpayers are taking responsibility for students' debts rather than the students themselves. Providing amnesty to students would put more of a burden on those taxpayers, and it should not be the other taxpayers' duties to pay for a problem that should be handled by the students and their families.]]>

However this is not entirely true. Students that are getting into colleges usually pay attention to what they are spending their time on and wont be over glamorous with their money spending. Also, students with this accumulating debt wont be aware of their debts but in this way, students are relieved of pressure to work for themselves. As addressed early in the essay, in the future for America, colleges must concede to the fact that students will be carrying out much bigger tasks for the government and for the economy.]]>

The debt forgiveness is supposed to help students, but it is not for some students. In addition, about one trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is federal loans. This means that US taxpayer are paying for students' debt rather than students and their families. The students should repay debt by themseves. The tax should help countries in our ways. Last three years, the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent. Students keep adding more debt. If debt forgiveness come true, it is hard to know how many money will get into it. So, it seems that calling for debt forgiveness has more problems, government should come up with a better idea to help students.]]>

If a four-year college tuition price keeps increasing rapidly, then more people plan on not paying for it. One can escape paying full or even half price for college in order to avoid debt and giving up much of their available money. However, such programs can put restrictions on those who wish to be out of debt. For example, students must prove their family income is less than a certain bracket of income in order to be elgiable to take part in this amnesty. By setting up boundries and limitations on students who can and cannot apply, the community program has limited its arms out to those who truly need the help.]]>

Although loans and student debts are not something good to start life out with, debt forgiveness idealizes the loan sitution through the belief that most debts will be forgiven in the future. If loan debts are forgiven, students may be irresponsible with the money they earn after college. Having a debt over their head will allow them to learn how to be frugal and responsible with their earnings. In the past 30 years, four-year college tuition has exponentially grown by 357 percent. If the student loans are to be forgiven and will continue to be forgiven, the cost for tuition will continue to rise, so the government will have to cover a greater cost each year. This will effect the economy in the fact that students will have greater debt forgivness needed. It will also have an overall negative effect the economy as money will be put into college debts rather than paying, after-college jobs. With a lower-paying job, college graduates will not earn as much money as they would if more government money was being put into corporations, but the government would be putting more money into the rid of their college debts. Therefore, the forgiveness of debts will lead to irresponisible spending by college students and government funds.]]>

When the government forgives students of their college loans and debts, the general taxpayers pay for this out-of-pocket, rather than the specific parents and students thus leading to financial irresponsiblity.

While this is a valid concern, it's not a likely outcome of ridding students of being in debt. The claim that students will spend their money that would have gone towards paying their debt is also an argument some have, but it's more likely that it won't be the case. Especially in this harsh economy, students are conserving money more than ever, and if their money isn't going to pay off the piles of debt they're left with, it's most likely going to be saved. However, the outcome of the extra money is uncontrolable, and some very well might be spent of frivolous items. With the cost of attending a university sky rocketing in the last 30 years, it only makes sense to help the students out.]]>

Students won't feel the responsibility to try hard in college if they arent paying for it. debt amnesty also causes a raise in taxes, since american tax payer money would be going to fund student loans.

An example of a problem that can occur is that when the debt is forgiven, students will consider the money as a &quot;leisure&quot; item that they can spend on unimportant things beside a tuition. Because of debt forgiveness, many students might get laid back and set precedent that similar loans will also get pardoned in the future. Opponents also claim the fact that $1 trillion of the current $1.2 is actually being paid for by US taxpayers meaning that the current debt situation is actually helpful for students since their family is not the only one directly paying for it. Because of these facts, opponents argue that the current debt situation is fine and that tampering with it might only cause more harm than good.]]>

Student loan forgiveness plan will sprout future loans and in the future accumulate more college debt then initial statistics show. If loan debts forgiven, some students will spend money on frivolous items, not on tuition. Giving such economic wiggle room will not teach students to use money in a smart way but rather create a rookie spending spree mistakess. Yet about 1 trillion of the current 1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loan, creating a taxpayers nightmare of paying of for student debt instead of students and families themeselves.

I oppose both these statements do to the fact that yes their might be a few students who would like to cheat the system, but the minority is not the majority most people actually feel bad about cheating people out of their hard earned pay. Another fact that I feel is incorrect is that people will buy ridiculous items with the money they are saving from paying tuition, what people don't realize is that by buying those items they are putting money into the economy helping economic growthwhich gives tax payers more money so they can help pay for the $1 trillion to pay for college intuitions.]]>

Forgiven college debt may promote accumulating debt and as well as setting a precedent for similar loans in the future. Others are against the proposal because some students may use their money on things other than tution. However, $1 trillion out of the current $1.2 trillion federal loans are student debt loans. For US taxpayers, this means rather than spending their taxes on important necessities, they are paying for students' debts. Even if loan debts are forgiven, students still must pay for many other items entering college, such as room and board, books, and school supplies. The last 30 years of four-year college tution has grown to nearly 357 percent. This trend will only increase unless debt lest the debt amnesty takes into action. This is why it is necessary to give sudents amnesty for college loans in order to keep the American dream alive.]]>

Also, if all loans that studednts are in debt in, will be cleared, then students may go and spend the money they got back, or had on the side on things that are use less for school. The reason this deal, isn't fair for the average American citizen, is because they are paying more taxes on things, because of student debt. Which means that they are spending more money on students then they are on they own family, who might need more support. Maybe, if college cost so much for some, then they should figure it out themselves and get a job to support them while in college instead of being in so much debt, because at the same time being in debt, ruins your credit score, which in the long run isn't good, because when you go and apply for another credit card, you could get rejected, because of having bad credit.]]>

Yes, younger people do tend to be naive about certain aspects of life, but we are not talking about high schoolers, but rather college students who have ambitions and hopes for thier futures, students who realize the immense responsibilities and problems that lie ahead; they are not so irresponsible, but rather show a strong sense of character and maturity by trying to get a college education and moves towards a brighter future, not only for themselves, but for all of America. Thus it somewhat justifies the toll that is taken on tax payers, for they are paying for educations that will make thier futures easier, however, none of this can be done if colleges do not offer such debt amnesty programs.]]>

Thirdly, if not payed by the student, the debt exists as an unpaid federal loan, meaning that all hard-working taxpaying Americans are forced to pay for the majority ($1,000,000,000,000 of a possible $1,200,000,000,000) of student debt.]]>

This as a result promotes the accumulation of even more college debt. In addition, if loans are forgiven, some students are likely to spend more money on frivolous items rather than tuition. Out of the $1.2 trillion in student debt, about $1 trillion is in federal student loans, meaning US taxpayers are paying for student's debts rather than the students and families. Within the last 30 years, the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent. This means that students add more debt to pay for colleges setting a continous trend. If the students recieve amnesty, they will not have to pay for college loans.]]>

Would that just mean that anyone with over a 2.5 could enter in college with little cost? The payment recieved by the many attending college is what keeps the college going, and the professors paid in the first place. Not only are the people who went to college in debt, but the own econonomy that those people are under. What will happen to those who are already out of college? They would certainly complain about having to pay for loans even after college if those who are in don't have to. This would also lead to questioning of other people having to pay loans for other things such as getting a loan on a house or a car, etc, and would eventually affect the economy in a greater way than anyone can imagine. Around $1.2 trillion dollars is the current amount of debt that former or current college students face today. If suddenly, people would just styop paying or paying less, that debt will never be paid, in fact, it would soar higher, almost equal to the 357% that college tuition has escalated.]]>

Reason being for this problem is that when a student needs money for college and can't find a part time job due to the toughness of the economy its too hard to pay the college what they want in return of your education. So now the student has no choice but to borrow more and more money from them and didn't even think twice about how hard it is to pay them back. Once an immature student has too much money at one time they believe they can waste it on unneccessary products such as a new tv or an iphone. Once then who is gonna pay off this huge debt if the student cannot, it is then forced on the people to pay through tax dollars for that person(s) idiotic behavior. Then once another student does it, then another, and another, now everyone is in debt and it's costing the whole economy this debt crisis. In some cases however, it's not always the students fault. Say he cannot find a job and can't go to school unless he borrows money well in that case he had no choice. Those are the people that deserve their debts to be set free and not be bound against them.]]>

One such potential problem is that forgiving these debts now will set a precedent that similar loans will be forgiven in the future, therefore leading students to believe that accumulating these debts is acceptable. If these debts are promoted as accebtable, students may then be more likely to spend money they would otherwise put towards tuition on frivolous items instead. This then creates a pattern of fiscal irresponsibility, where students are unconcerned about being in debt. In this scenario, and currently, the brunt of the payments have to be carried by taxpayers who pay approximately $1 trillion of the $1.2 trillion in student debt.

Another point brought to attention by those opposing the relieving of debts is the fear that students will spend their money frivalously on unimportant items. This point is hardly jusitifiable. Due to high tuition costs and debts, most students are trying to scrape up any money they can find just to be able to eat every day, pay for gas, rent, etc. That being said, the extra money would not go to waste.]]>

Now if the loan debt if forgiven the studeny might use the money that wouldve been used on paying off thier debt by buying foolishness and wasting thier money. The entire point of debt forgivness is to pay off the students loan for them so they can take thier money and live a comfortable lifestyle without having to worry about their loan debts. There is $1 trillion of student loan debt that the US tax payers are paying and they would be really upset if the students went and spent their money on uneeded things while they have to pay off debt thats not even thiers. In the last 30 years the cost of public four-year college tuition has risen by 357 percent, which adds more debt on students each year. Debt forgiveness would be a great thing for college students, and would give them a chance to live a debt free lifestyle after college.]]>

Some of these effects being that it will promote accumulating more college debt, the money will be spent on frivolous items instead of tuition, the US taxpayers are paying insteady of the students and their families, and lastly this willl become a trend. First off forgiving the college debt will not promote new debt, in other words the students will no longer focus on their debt but instead on their studies, and not figuring out more ways to spend. Secondly US taxpayers will in fact be investing in their future as well as paying for a students' debt, this is a great way to support the growth of their government, by helping the people that will help the US tax payers in the future. Lastly this amnesty will most likely grow in the next couple of years because most of the students will want to focus more on their studies rather than the stress of graduationg with debt.]]>

College is a time for students to learn how to live on their own in the real world. Forgiving their student loans is, in a sense, telling them that it is okay not to pay back what they owe. Debt is an actual problem in the real world, and credit card or insurance companies aren't just going to give out their services for free. About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans. That means that when students fail to pay their tuition, our tax dollars-not the school-pays it for them. So students can basically let other US citizens pay for their education while they spend their money on whatever they please.]]>

Rather than wasting taxpayers money on dept we should offer jobs, or community service ours to student who are unable to make ends meat. Giving amnesty to those who dont pay off loans is like forgiving people who panhandle. If givin free money, thats what it would be, some students may take this as an oppertunity to buy items not needed to continue their college career. Every other adult adult had to mature sooner or later; giving out hand outs only delays this process, which will lead to more problems in the future for the new generation.]]>

As well as with this, $1 trillion of student loans are being paid for by taxes instead of by families and students themselves. Not all of this is the fault of the students, though, as within a thirty year period, four-year college tuition has gone up by 357%, meaning that even if the student can pay the majority of it, they'll never have enough, even if they earn as much as someone did 30 years ago.]]>

Relieve the pressure of mounting debt on overstressed students already struggling to make a living, right? However, as productive and inventive as the idea is, it still has its major drawbacks. At the end of the day, these are still students without much experience in living in the real world. Expecting them to responsibly manage their finances is like expecting a little boy to eat his newly acquired halloween candy in moderation; it's not reasonable. Rather, as burdensome as they can be, student loans teach students to be responsible with their already limited funds and prevent kids from spending them foolishly elsewhere, such as on excess clothing and frivolous entertainment. Furthermore, bypassing student loans does not only effect the students. In a recent study, it was discovered that $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is provided by government loaning, meaning that the big losers in all of this are the U.S. taxpayers. All in all, don't pardon their debt, because you are not only harming the students but you are harming yourself.]]>

Another potential problem includes that some students may end up spending the money on frivolous items, not on tuition or other necessary needs.In addition, about $ 1 trillion of the current $ 1.2 trillion in student debt is in the federal student loans. In other words, this means that US taxpayers will end up paying for students' debt rather than using the money to help students and families. In the last 30 years, the cost of attending a public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent. This means that students actually add more debt to pay for college nowadays, this trend is continuing. So if we get the debt amnesty, we as students will not have to pay for college loans, but the US taxpayers will. In other words, you will not escape your college debt, it will reach to you later on in another form.]]>

Students that are allowed to be apart of the student amnesty program will leave college debt free and will have the money they need to buy a nice place to live and a car to transport them to and from work. Another worry some may have that in the future students would expect all their loans to be forgiven. That isn't true. By the time the students are graduating from college they have enough real world experiences to know that not every loan is going to be forgiven. The student amnesty program will give the students a clear slate and alllow them to start their life and not worry about $20,000 dollars they have to pay back for getting an education. Research has shown that about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is paid by the US taxpayers rather than the students themselves. If the debt amnesty program is allowed the US taxpayers will no longer be paying the state money, but recieving more money with what they get back in taxes. Overall, the student amnesty program should be allowed because it teaches the students to be responisble, it allows them to have money in their pocket when they graduate and lastly, it saves the US taxpayers money as well.]]>

However, with or without the forgiven loans, students will be spending their money on frivolous items. Because the loans are forgiven does not mean that the students are bound to spending their money on useless items. Students may think of this forgiven loan as a blessing and use that as motivation to use the money on tuition. Additionally, the potential problem of these loans being forgiven cannot ensure that other loans will be eliminated as well. Other loans are more crucial, whcih shows that in the future similar loans will not be forgiven. It can not be assumed that only because of this one loan being forgiven that all other loans will follow as well. Also, the US taxpayer should not feel burdened by the increase in taxes. Most US taxpayers are involved with children somehow whether it is their own children, or neices and nephews, or family friends. Thus, the US taxpayer should be more motivated to offer a bit more money in order to help the students around them. Therefore, a student's college debt should be forgiven.]]>

For example, if a student's college debt is forgiven, it promotes accumulating more college debt later on. If loan debts are constantly being forgiven without consequence, some students may take advantage of it and spend money on non-school-related items instead of tuition. Appromimately $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans, which means that US taxpayers are indeed paying for student loan debts rather than the students themselves. In the last 30 years, the cost attending a public four-year college has dramatically increased by an astounding 357 percent. This means that students are adding more debt to pay for college which set a type of continuing trend for other students to follow: get amnesty and you won't have to pay college loans. While student debt is a huge problem and amnesty programs are just allowing students to continue not paying off their college loans, there might be some positive things to letting the loans just &quot;slide&quot; so the students can enjoy their college experience without having to fork out their savings. No student wants to pay what money they have been saving up since they were in grade school on their education if they really want to spend that money on getting an apartment or renting a condo after they graduate college. Allowing for amnesty programs rids students of the stressful nights where they have to think about how they're going to eventually pay off their student debt, aside from studying for tests and paying gas and food bills. With amnesty programs, young adults are eased into the real&quot;adult world&quot; because they won't get slapped in the face with a huge debt right out of college. Sure, they will eventually have to pay off other debts but in the meantime it's a huge relief to be cut some slack, especially if students are being stressed out with the other components of their still maturing lives.]]>

Once they have a better paying job out of college, they should eventually be able to pay all their student loan debts back. Also, it is not just that currently enrolled college students would not have to pay their debts as previous students. Everyone has to do this in their life if they chose to go to college, no one gets excused. You must pay to go to college, it has always been like this. Forgiving these loans and not having students pay them back would create chaos between people, which is unnecessary.

The debt forgiveness sets a precedent that similar loans in the future will also be forgotten, and that does not happen in the &quot;real world.&quot; This situation would just cause more and more debt for the future. Also, if the loan debts are forgiven, there is no gurantee that the studnent will use the money they saved on college for living comfortably. The student could even spend money on frivolous items like drugs and alcohol; aiding addiction. Students in college are not the most mature or well thought out people in the world, so the majority of students given this aid would use it on items that are unneccessary.]]>

This information supports the bias that should there be amnesty, this tendency will become a trend, meaning that forgiven college debt promotes accumulating college debt. College debt amnesty must be given, for the debt will eventually swallow the country as a whole. In the last 30 years, the cost of public four-year college tuition has increases by 357 percent. Students have already accumulated $1.2 trillion in debt, and US taxpayers are currently paying $1 trillion of this debt. Should this debt grow and continue to expand, everyone will lose money.

If the students in college recieved free money for their education, it would mean that &quot;US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than students &amp; family.&quot; This means that money would be taken out of our pockets to pay for someone's college tuition whom we do not even know. Additionally, whether or not this person decides to do something with his education afteer graduating is unknown. The person may decide to be a stay at home parent instead of having a career in what they studied. Our money then would have been wasted.]]>

The students that are in debt will go more in debt because the tax and even more if they take more college classes. The debt forgiveness would be great for people with low income of money which means they can still survive and work with out worring about losing there apartment or phone or even there car that they need. So debt forgiveness would really help out students that cant afford to pay back there loan which will rise do to taxes. When the 1.2 trillion dollars that are lent to the students doing a student loan for college would be spent towards the high school education would also help plan that people in the future dont have to have as much experince that they need now with a jobs that they can learn in high school from classes they take.]]>

Also, they argue that tax payers would only be paying for students to go to college instead of paying for students and families and that the students would be stealing from the gorvernment's tax payer money. However, this is all false. One thing students learn in college is responsibility. They'll learn how to manage their money, allowing them to steadyily pay off their debts. Also, the tax paying part would become a ever going cycle. One the student graduates and gets a job, then he/she can start paying his/her taxes and allowing the next bunch of students to continue to acheieve higher education.]]>

This could be resolved by making the requirments to get into college higher. By lowering the prices in college makes scholarships less valuable because everyone should be able to afford college after the lowered prices. However this does make it easier to pay off the debt and that means people could spend the money on other matarials. There is a reason why schooling in America is better than most countries because America is one of the few countries that make students pay while in other countries people attend college for free and because of that they have less of an education.]]>

Most are irritated by the fact that $1 trillion out of the $1.2 trillion is being payed by taxpayers, and that is seemed as unfair to the civilians who have to pay for students, rather than their families paying for it. Over all, civilians do not think it is fair to solve this student debt problem and make it easier for them, they seem to believe that if you get an education, you have to pay for all of it and follow through with the payment because if you're going to school and you get your diploma, then you should have to pay the cost it is to get your education.]]>

This can act as a crutch for students to put less effort and acknolegement into future college debt, casuing them to stack their debts higher than before, accumilating more of it for other companies to pay off. It is not unheard for college students to have debt on credit cards, or spent money in a less than frugal way, and this may give leeway for such actions to occur. Taxpayers can also anticipate an addition to their 1 trillion dollar tab being paid for by the federal government for student loans alone.

If we do put debt forgiveness in, then many students' stress would be relieved and many could go on and live their lives the way they want to. Think about it, if we forgive debt tyhen students will continue collage and get their careers there looking for. Also, more students would not be afraid of going to collage because they wouldnt have to worry about haveing so much debt. If we do this it will pay off in the long run because the students will grow up and have great jobs, that help the economy get stronger.]]>

To allow debt-free student loans to students with a 2.5 grade point average would be comletely biased. All students should be guaranted debt-free college loans if college's are proposing to solve this issue only to students who meet a certain grade requirement. If the isssue is that students are graduating and in return feeling overwhelmed by student loans to repay, then what students are we really helping?]]>

It is also argued that if the student is not spending money on tuition, they will spend it on frivolous items.

Some are saying that creating a new student amnesty program will result in students spending their money on other items rather than on their tuition, and because college would forgive a student's college debt, essentially more college debt will be accumulated because they would not have to pay for their tuition. In addition to the problem with which many colleges and students face, federal taxpayers will have to pay for these students tuitions from federal taxes, which can accumulate up to $1 trillion dollars, rather than having the families pay for the student debt themselves. But, without a new type of student loan program, many students will face much hardship with the risky job market, and trying to pay of their loans. A new type of student loan program is needed to help insure the students that they will be able to satrt their lives in a positive note rather than in debt.]]>

Debt forgiveness promotes the idea that other loans will also be forgiven, which promotes the accumulation of more debt. Additionally, most college debt belongs to the federal government, about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion, so taxpayers would be forced to pay back this debt rather than students and their families. And finally, the price of college tuition has grown significantly, rising at 357% in the last 30 years, so the more debt is forgiven, the more money simply is not paid. However, the massive amount of debt accumulation that college has created will only worsen if such a large burden is continually placed on students and their families. Additionally, if the burden of debt is shared equally by all Americans, it can be more manageably returned to the federal government.]]>

Students are just entering into college and are still young. Although many have a new sense of responsibility when entering college, many others do not always take that responsibility, especially with money in the student's hands. In addition, as much as $1 trillion of the $1.2 trillion student debts is in federal student loans, which means that US taxpayers are paying for the student's debt. This even means that students might not even pay for their loans at all, leaving every penny to the US taxpayers. People may be worried that students would be carefree and hold no responsibility with that money provided to help students. However, those people are wrong because there are many people out there who cannot pay off the loan because the tuitions and loans given are too high. Students indeed need to be given aid in getting through college with little trouble with money. Education is key for students to mature and understand what is in store for them in the future.]]>

This would create a rise in the amount of students who recieve student loans. They also argue that students would spend any of their loan money on personal evspenses and unnecessary item than on what they are actually for, which is to pay for their tuition. There is also an opposition to this because the money that is being used to pay for student loans is coming from the money of tax payers. The amount of debt that students have is too big to be forgiving it. However, if students would be excused of their loans more people would be going to college in the future and if students are willing to spend time after grade school to continue their education it shows that they are serious about what they do and would think twice before going and spending all of their money on unnecessary items. These students who decide to pursue a college education will eventually be tax payers themselves, so they will be paying these loans for other also.]]>

That yearly, college tuition grows and becomes much difficult for college graduates to pay for. And it is now difficult to find a right stable job that you can work for and earn the amount of salary that will help you for your needs, and to pay your debts, and taxes. The government should do something about this, like reduce the pay that college graduates does and instead, help them out pay for their debts.]]>

Potential debt forgiveness sets a precedent that similar loans in the future will also be forgiven the debt promontes accumulating more and more debt to tag along. A counterarguement is that if the loan debts are forgiven some students will spend their money on usdelesds items, not towards their education. An example is that about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal loans. Thus making US taxpayers pay for the students debt rather than their own families. ALso, in the last thirty years the cost of public four year college tuition has grown by nearly 357 percent meaning that students need to add more debt to pay off their debt at hand. This back and forth game sets a trend to get debt amnesty and not pay for their college loans.]]>

For example, a potential problem that may come because of this proposal is that students may be likely to spend their money on frivolous items and not on tuition. Also another major fault in this debt forgiveness is that taxes would rise for US taxpayers as they would now be paying that student debt rather than the students families directly. Also the forgiven college debt would promote the accumulatin of even more college debt. Other the other hand their are positives to the debt forgiveness proposal. One of those positives is that in the last 30 years, the cost of college tuition has grown by 357 percent which results in student debt piling up but if one is able to get debt amnesty, then those loans will not have to be apid for and they can focus on their school work rather than worry about the debt. These are the positives and negatives associated with this proposal.]]>

One of the major problems with colleges allowing debt forgiveness is that it sets a precedent for other students that they can accumulate debt amd it will all eventually be forgiven. Another problem with giving students amnesty for college loans is that students will potentially spend money on frivolous items rather then tuition. Forgiving college debt also has an adverse effect on US taxpayers because they will be paying for the $1 trillion of forgiven federal student loans in taxes rather then the students and the families paying for it themselves. This could also bring up the potential problem of accumulating more and more debt for americans to pay because as college tuition increases so does the debt of students who are relying on forgiveness of their debts. With all these problems that come along with student debt forgiveness, it is clear that the solution for increasingly unpayable student debt must be found elsewhere.]]>

The benefits of debt forgiveness outweigh the negative aspects and is a more viable solution.]]>

There is no such thing as paying too much for a great education, so why focus key on that? In todays society, education slowly fades away as technology advances.

Therefore, why is debt the problem? If our tax dollars can fund stupid, idiotic tests like this one, our money towards school debt should be no problem at all.]]>

An example of this is debt promotes. When you forgive debt promotes, more debt accumulates over time. If loan debts are forgiven, students will spend more money on frivoulous items instead of their tuition. There is an estimate of $1 trillion out of $1.2 trillion in student debt and federal loans, this is causing US tax payers to pay for students debts rather than students and families. In the last thirty years, the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357%. This indicates that if students keep adding more debt to pay for college they will not get debt amnesty and will not have to pay college loans.]]>

Students will also come to realize that they might be forgiven on other debts as well, so they will spend money on frivolous unneccessary items. Most students will think that by not paying for the student loans, the debt is dissapearing into thin air. However, $ 1 trillion is recieved from the American tax payers to pay for the &quot;forgiven&quot; student loans. Without amnesty, some college students are only following a trend and aren't actually serious about getting an education. If student loans are disregarded, some students will take advantage and get an education that won't be neccessary for their life's goals.]]>

Over the last 30 years the cost of tuition for colleges has been continuously increasing, it has grown rapidly about 357 percent putting studetns into deeper and deeper depth. But with the new proposal of giving students amnesty for college loans studetns will not have to pay back the loans. Students not paying back their college loans results in a large sum of money now left in their and student could use this on frivolous itmes instead of towards their tuition for further higher education. About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans which means that US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than the students and families. Putting debt amnety into action for college students would reduce the tax payed by US citizens. However debt amnity could pose an issue in regards to other loans. Forgiving college debt sets a precedent that similar loans in the future will be forgiven as well and forgiving college debt also promkotes accumulating more college debt. Students will begin to fall back on the debt amnety as their safety net.]]>

However, the debt is already seeing negative effects, as about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans, which leads to taxpayers paying for the debt rather than those actually responsible. Also, in the last 30 years, the cost of four year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent. This increase in cost just adds more debt to pay and continues the trend set by college tuition history.

Some believe that if these college debts are forgiven now, these young students will be led to the false impression that loans in the future will also be forgiven. Also, some do no trust these young students to spend the money they are given in a wise manner and are afraid that they will spend on personal luxuries rather than tuition. However, it must be noted that about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion student debt is being covered by the US taxpayers. The initial purpose of taxes is to provide for students and families, but because of this student debt dilemma, the majority of the tax money is going into pay college debts. To make matters worse, college tuition has been on a rapid rise, growing about 357% in the last thirty years. This makes college tuition more difficult to pay for an even greater portion of the student population. This only leads to a further college debt and requires an even greater portion of the US taxmoney to cover for the growing debt. For this reason, action must be taken to assist these students who are striving to achieve their dreams. Clearly, a student debt amnesty program can greatly benefit many students and should be established.]]>

If the student cannot afford tuition she/he won't be able to go to a four year college. In my opinion taxpayers shouldn't pay the students' debts.]]>

Tuition is constantly rising, which adds more debt for students to pay. The money that they will recieve will be used for the necessities that they need since they may not have enough money due to their debt. Also, if students recieve this money, they may may waste it on things that they really do not need. They would not use it for a set of books or anything towards school; it may be used for shopping or extra items not needed at the time. If this amnesty is given to students, it will promote students to collect more and more debt, which will lead them to a future of constantly paying for an education they recieved years ago. US taxpayers are currently paying for students' debt instead of students and families. If this continues to happen, the economy will spiral down into another recession because no one will have the ability to pay for their own debts.]]>

Another potential hazard on the other end of the spectrum is the possibility of students chosing to invest surplus money on frivolous items as opposed to tution causing a diversion of the monitary flow. Another economic adjustment that would have to be accounted for is the trsansfer of debt responcibility from the families of the students to the tax payers. That would be a new burden of aproximatly one trillion dollars to the American tax system. This burden will only grow. In the last thirty years the cost of public four year college tuition has gone up by 357 percent. The continuation of that trend will put a wieght on the American economy that will bend us untill we break.]]>

The cost to run a college: To regulate food, rooms, classroom supplies, teacher salaries, etc. for tens of thousands of students will set a good college back at least a million dollars a year. Without these paid student loans, the colleges would nearly be teaching for free, effectively losing all their money. Sure, if they lose their money, we can keep ours, but we would not be receiving the higher level education that is only possible at these high-grade colleges. Ultimately, the loan system could be less rigid for the financially insecure, but keeping the school alive is what's most important in this society.]]>

It is feared that the youth of America, if pardoned from their finiancial debt, will not partake in responsible spending habits and will continue to spend recklessly on items they should not be able to afford. However, while the approximate $1 trillion of student debt would require a significant amount of tax funds, an attempt to make education affordable, or at least to reduce the impact of the debt upon the student, would allow the student to better establish themselves in society before being overwhelmed by an onslaught of college debt; a system that has established and evidently benefitted the youth of the United Kingdom. In the United States, our current system of secondary education discourages disadvantaged or even middle-class youth from pursuing an education, and this unequal opprotunity created by the fear of formidable debt does not represent progressive, equitable values that are upheld by traditional American values. The $1 trillion in student debt is, indisputably, a more progressive and worthwhile contribution to the nation than other recipients of tax funds such as military equipment and foreign military occupancy, which represents over $13 trillion of US debt. Education, overall, is the strongest creator of equality and progressive action to American citizens, and should be protected and encouraged.]]>

They see that there may be a potential problem in the future where those students who had loans forgiven in the past will think that they can get similar loans forgiven as well. With loan forgiveness, students aren't too worried about paying off their tuition and therefore may spend money on luxury items. If the students were allowed to receive debt forgiveness then the U.S. taxpayers will be the ones paying off the debt that was forgiven. In the last thirty years the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent, meaning that students have to add more debt to pay for college. If the tuition cost isn't reduced, then students will keep thinking that they won't have to pay off their college loans because of the debt amnesty.]]>

It will just add more debt to the country which the taxpayers will eventually have to pay. This will upset many American citizens and cause another problem to arise. Although some families cannot afford to pay for their children's college tuition, they often still put them through higher education which leaves debts that can be paid off later on without interests. A problem with forgiving the debt of 2.5 GPA students is that many financially stable students will also be able to attend college without any debts. Forigivng the college debt might seem like a good solution for now but is not something beneficial for anyone in the long run. In the future, there are not going to be many students and families that pay their college tuitions, which will be a major problem.]]>

Some say that if loan debts are forgiven, students will spend money on frivolous items, not on tuition. But nobody can say that for sure, because this has never been an option and if it was, I'm sure students would make the right decision. About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans, which means US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than students &amp; families. In the last 30 years, the cost of a public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 375%, which means that students add more debt to pay for college. This also sets a continuing trend- if you get debt amnesty, you won't have to pay for college loans. But nobody is going to use this as a backup, because it is too much money to risk and you really can't trust the education system.]]>

Many students entering college drop out because of the amount of money they owe, or some may never enter college because of the fear of debt. This fact alone will severely hurt the economy by restricting the amount of people in the work force. Although there are some students that may deviate and use college loans on futile items, there are many young promising people amongst the generation of students that are enrolled in college. If they are able to pay off their debts for their education, then they will be able to contribute what they've learned back into their community. Another argument that many opposers have against forgiving college loans is that it will force taxpayers to pay off another student's debt rather then focusing on paying off their own debts. Although this is true, it is highly beneficial in the long run because those students who are able to continue their education will be able to contribute back to the nation and it's citizens. Allowing amnesty for college loans will greatly benefit the nation by producing a large pool of students that will use their education to their advantage and contribute back to their communities.]]>

This will create more student debts over time and have more and more students oweing money each year. If the loan debts will be forgiven, the students will spend money on unimportant things and not spend their money on their tuition. About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in the student debt is in federal student loans which means that students U.S taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than the students and families. The last 30 years cost of public four-year college tuition that has grown rapidly by 357 percent, which means that students add more debt to pay for college and then get debt amnest and will end up not having money to pay fort college loans.]]>

When students begin to accumalate debt it must be paid back, students who are forgiven of their debts are likely to be ungrateful and the more the debt increases without being paid back, the less money goes back into the school to educate the students attending in the following years. Since the cost of going to and staying in a college increases as the years pass, the more debt students accumalate and even less money returns to the school so that they have to continue to increase tuition to keep up with the loss. It is not sensible to give students percieved immunity to paying off student loans, especially when it begins to affect the people other than the student and their family becasue the debt must be paid off so it simply moves from the student's problem to that of the taxpayers who have taken no part in this student's college life or events therefter. If a student isn't successful after graduating school with a degree, that is not the fault of the school. There is also the risk of careless spending, the knowledge of a student loan yet to be paid off makes the difference in deciding whether to eat a five star restaurant and shopping smart to make a cheap home-cooked meal. Schools simply cannot afford to forgive student debts.]]>

Students debts are currently amounting to $1.2 trillion with $1 trillion in federal students loans. If the debts are forgiven as the proposal is saying, then taxpayers are paying for the students debt. It is not the taxpayers responsibility to pay for college students as college education is a self gain and should be paid by the certain individual. With college loan forgiveness a precedent can be set to where other loans should be forgiven. With so many debts being forgiven an economic crisis can quickly occur as people are buying but not repaying their debts. Once again will it have to be the taxpayers money to pay for these debts too? No, it is the individuals responsibilty. Student loans amnesty should be precautioned as many adverse effects can occur.]]>

If college debt is forgiven, future college debt would be forgiven. Most of the money in student debt is in federal student loans. In fact, $1 trillion of the $1.2 trillion in student loans is federal, so U.S. tax dollars would be paying for this debt, rather than the actual students. Also, tuition of colleges and universities has been greatly increasing over the past 30 years by 357%. Therefore, in the future and as these tuitions increase, debt will increase and, if there is amnesty for these loans, even more tax money will be spent on them. Without the responsibility of paying back these loans, students may begin spending their money on unimportant items, leaving the rest of the U.S. to pay for their education.]]>

This could very well happen and it might cause big riots and oppositions towards the system. Another problem that comes with forgiving students of their loan debts is the students' spending of money on un-important items. It would be expected though that if a student is being helped with their debt they would have more money to spend on other things, and thats just something we cant prevent. Another point that comes to mind is the fact that their is $1.2 trillion in student debts, but $1 trillion of that is federal student loans. This means that the students and families aren't the ones paying for that, it's the US taxpayers. If the country is already paying for most of the debt, why help more?]]>

This is the last thing colleges want. Besides, about $1 trillion of student debts are payed for by fellow American taxpayers, and not the immediate family of the students, because the debt is in federal loans. Although this may be true, a remaining $2 billion dollars are left to be payed by the families of students. College is increasing rapidly as the years go by, so by 2020 that $2 billion may be up to $20 billlion. Our country should value the education of its people, more than it does the money coming out of their pockets.

When students don't pass their courses, the colleges are losing money and will need more tax dollars to fund education than ever before. Tax payers are already paying for some of college students' debts and they may not be happy about more of their tax dollars going towards the schools, for the reason being that students are getting lazy and not passing their classes. College students do seem to stress a lot about college bills, but they are adults now and they should know that having to pay their bills is what growing up is all about. It should teach them to save their money and not spend it on frivulous items, because money can no longer be used for their lavish wants, but should be used for the more important things like education, food and housing. Allowing them to go to college without the students paying off there debts is giving them a reason NOT to grow up into the responsible adults that they are needed to be in today's spciety.]]>

In fact, as of the last 30 years, the cost of a four-year public college tuition has grown by 357%.]]>

Students may even get carried away with their loans being forgiven and continue to spend their money on other items and not on their college loans. Around 80% of the student debt today is from taxpayers money, which should be spent on other things according to many, but instead it is being used to help out with student loans. Within the last 30 years or so the average four-year colleges' tuition has increased, therefore, just stacking up the amount of debt for students everywhere. So if a student is to get debt amnesty they no longer will have to deal with theses issues and will not have to pay college loans.]]>

Some argue that forgiving these loans will hurt the future economic decisions current college students make, as it sets an unrealistic view for the future. Students will believe that future loans will also be forgiven, so they will accumulate more debt and not be careful with the loans they choose to take. College students will also use the money that they could spend on tuition on frivolous items rather than on bettering themselves through education. Debt forgiveness would not only negatively affect college students, but also the United States as a whole.

For example, if a person rids themself of college debt who is to say that they wont accumulate more. The forgiven debt will allow the person to create even more debt becuase they do not have to pay for the original debt. Another possible problem with debt amnesty is if loan debts are forgiven, some students will spend money on unimportant items rather than tuition. People will create large amounts of debt if they know that their grade-point average is above 2.5 and spend the money that should be used toward tuition to other things such as a new tv or new clothes.They will create large amounts of debt simply because they know they will not have to pay for it. Over the last 30 years, the cost of a public four year college tuition has increased by 357 percent meaning that the amount of debt students accumulate is on the rise. More debt would mean more of a pardon which would mean more debt for taxpayers to pay off. While debt amnesty may sound good in theory, in reality, it would cause more problems than it solved.]]>

However, most students earn this money through jobs or through loans of a relative and/or friends. Thus this said money cannot, and should not, be a concern of the state or colleges. Should this money be a concern it should be to colleges that have not forgiven a student of their debt(s) and the student that has not repaid their loan. Students also cannot be held responisble for money that is used by their college. If colleges wish to avoid their own debt then perhaps keeping a list of how many students per year they can afford to forgive, once said list is filled then no more students can apply for amnesty in terms of debt. This is not a permanent solution but it may help prevent colleges from going bankrupt in the future. As for the cost of tuition, colleges may wish to address this with the state government. Whether they do or do not, colleges should lower their price of tuition. This would allow more students to be able to pay their college loans/debts and colleges would earn a steady stream of money; which woudl solve any future problems with college debts.]]>

For example, if debts are forgiven, the student will believe that it is okay to have more debt because they think that will also be forgiven in the future. This will not always be the case, and the student will end up being in a lot of debt which they can not get out of. Another thing is that if students have extra money, they will spend it on things that are unneeded, rather than things that will help their education. College is full of parties, and students may waste their money on things for these parties. Most of what pays for these debts is coming from US taxpayers. Forgiving these debts is making students irresponsible and wasting the money of US citizens who need money for their own families.]]>

The first issue on giving students an opportunity to free loans is &quot;students will spend money on frivolous items, not on tuition.&quot; Many students in college don not find college payments to be the most necessarily important item that needs to be paid off. Going into college, students are still learning what is more valuable and acceptable in todays world. More times than not, you will find that a student bought an xbox 360 instead of paying off school loans. This in my eyes is unacceptable when it comes to offering a free check . Another issue is &quot;about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans, this means US tax payers are paying for students debt rather than students &amp; families.&quot; With this being said, why give students such money when it is statisticly proven they do not even pay for schooling. If you give students this money, what would they do with it since they arent funding it towards school bills?]]>

In order to improve their lives dealing with college debt we need to improve the job market effectivly and accordingly. The facts are that they have these hardships because they are unable to obtain jobs that would normally obtainable with college degrees and they procide to take simpler jobs in the fast food market or construction.

It would encourage college students to take on more debt without a second thought. Taking on debt should be a a responsible and thought out decision but this would encourage reckless loaning. If loan debts are forgiven, students will spend money on frivolous items instead of tuition. About $1 trillion of the student debt is in federal funds, meaning the taxpayers are paying the debt and there has been an increase in students enrolling in college so there will be more debts to be paid. Taxpayers are already paying a great majority of the loans; loan forgiveness is an unnecessary burden on the taxpayers because they will have to pay more now to pay for the other $200 million loans. The more students taking on debt will mean more money that the taxpayers have to pay. On top of that, there is no garuntee that these students will graduate.]]>

Futhermore, the forgiving of college debt could start a dominio effect of all debt that people owe. Also, if the loan debts were to be forgiven, some students may spend that extra money of item that will not further their tution, education. In addition, 1 trillion dollars of the student debt is government loans, with debt forgiveness, the tax payers would have to pick up the balance due to this debt forgiveness. The student debt is continuously increasing over the last 30 years college tution has increased also by 357%, and it will continue to increase. The debt forgiveness will slow the process of the debt, but we will back to sqaure one because people are going to contiune to try and get a higher education and will borrow money to pay for it, and the student loan debt will continue to increase. At this point we just have to figure out should the students pay for it with some assistance, or someone else.]]>

However, in the real world these debs must be paid back and there are no exceptions. Another effect is that sometimes, if a student is given money they will spend the money carelessly instead of on important things like tuition. With extra money, a natural tendency is to buy expensive item that may not be an essential part to their lives, in which case they are wasting money. Lastly, this debt caused by student lones is mostly weighing on taxpayers shoulders.

Of the 1.2 trillion dollar debt in student loans alone, about 1 trillion of it is paid by the federal government. This means that only about $200,000 is actually paid by the family/student. People have also discussed about how college tution prices have risen over 357% in the last 30 years and saying that a higher education is still the best investment a student can make now in days. Overall, debt forgiveness is something that should be considered, however before being implemented, should be well thought out.]]>

Although this may be a valid cocern there are many way to asure banks and load providers that this will not be the case. Banks can check students account to varify that their money is in fact being spent on tuition, or not provide the student loan forgivness without a signed contract clearly stating that the moeny must go to college tuition. Additionaly, some claim that dubt forgivness may lead to similar loans to also be forgiven. Again, situations like that can easily be avoidable.

This is because college students would be in less debt, they have less stress, and they will be able to have no worries about college debt. Students being in less debt would allow them to buy any neccesities they may need that may have not been able to afford due to the significiant amount of debt they were in. The less stress they have, the more comfortable and prepared they would feel for any upcoming tests or exams they may have and a more structured lifestyle. They would also be able to work more efficiently. Having no worries about college debt would help them be more free to do what they find to be important.]]>

It will only cause more college debt to those students, but students that are in debt already know the consequences, which can mean that they will be wiser when it comes to spending. Another effect of this is that $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion is already being used in federal student loans, an outcome to that is that the US taxpayers will be paying for the debt instead of more valueable things, like their families. You can also say that debt is a factor in the 357 percent increase of public four-year college tuition, in the last 30 years. It is not the only cause of that though, there are more problems that cause that. If students get debt anmesty then they will not have to pay for college loans, that is a good solution.]]>

This would also keep adding to the college debt instead of erasing it. If students are forgiven from their student loans, they wil end up spending money on non-important items instead of paying for tuition. Also from the $1.2 trillion in student loans, it would mean that U.S taxpayers would be paying for the sudents debts rather then the students themselves or their families. As college tuition has increased over the last several years, it ends up adding more debt to the students which they most likely won't pay and they would get amnestied for it.]]>

In addition, since these loans are federal, US taxpayers are paying for these debts. Many argue that this is not fair, because these taxpayers are not the ones receiving the education, and therefore it should not be their responsibility to fund the debt forgiveness. As public tuition grows, these debts will only get greater and greater, thus continuing the trend of carelessness over loans since their debt is already forgiven.]]>

On the other hand, over 80% of the college debt is being paid by US taxpayers.

It is unfair to use the hard earned money of the tax payers to pay for students' college debts. Ultimately, forgiving college debt is setting a nad precent: the students will misunderstand that any debt in the future can be forgiven. This will encourage them to spend more money and become materilistic, which will lead to credit card debt, which is a debt that cannot be forgiven.

There many factors that also add on to why students should not be given help to get rid of their school debt as well, not just that they will spend the money on useless things. If a debt is forgiven at a college, the debt will just come back later, and most likey, even worst than it was before. If the government were to spend a lot of money on student loans, then taxpayers in the US wuld not be able to use that money for more inportant causes, like poverty and family support. That could be the counter argument for why students should not get help paying for their school debt, but still, help paying their debt can bring a positive change for families as well.]]>

The students in colleges need to limit on how much they are spending and what they are spending the money on. If the students get debt amnesty than they wont have to pay the money back that they owe to the US taxpayers that are paying for the their tuition. If the college students are working while paying of their debt and only spending their tuition money on their education they would not have a debt problem. Many of those students that are in debt problems are asking for forgiveness because they are spending their money on frivolous items. If the colleges forgive these students for being in debt because they did not know how to limit themselves than these colleges will be in debt themselves than many other college students will not be able to get a good education.]]>

It would be a great relief to be forgiven of all debt if you meet the requirments. In my opinion the requirments should be more strict. Atleast a grade-point average of a 3.0. If local colleges are to forgive students of their loans they need to be secure about the fact that the students are there strictly for their education. Taking such large amounts of money and forgetting it was owed, is a very big deal. I believe that it would be a great idea to begin debt forgiveness, as long as the students also do their part. there are many students that have the potential and intelligence to succeed , but are deprived of those oppurtunities simply because of a large number. Beginning this policy can also be the start up and increase of more motivation of those who once believed that they couldnt do it.]]>

If the loan depts are forgiven, some students will spen dmoney on frivilous items, not on tuition.

A potential problem that comes from this is how we ask the government to forgive debts so they could use that as an excuse and ask to be forgiven for outcoming loans in the future. The government and teachers also think that for forgiving these debt, students will spend their money on unessasary things and activites instead of their tuition. We all know thats not the case it appears that they want to control what we send our little and hardworking money on. If we didnt want to spend money on school we wouldn't be at school.]]>

With that being said, if students did not have to pay back student debt it would allow them to spend more money as a consumer which would help the economy. The house market would certainly improve; when college students graduate, and later want to start a family, they are burdened by their debts. This causes them to not be able to afford a house and thus the American sream is also being lost.

Forgiven debt will only further hurt the economy, it is as if universities and colleges are giving away money, or giving a free education. Although this new act may give students more oppurtunites to educate themselves, not all students will see it as that. Students could spend the money given to them on unrelated items, more than likely things that will distract them from their education. If the colleges do believe they should forgive the debt of students, they should only allow the students that honestly and truly deserve it. For example, the student that earned a 3.5 GPA and was active in school, but came from a poor home, they should be forgiven because they attempted to better their life and obviously will not have the money, once returning home, to pay off the debt. Forgiven debt should almost be like a scholarship earned by students while they were attending college, not just money to give away.]]>

Debt forgiveness could be more harmful and even wasteful compared to allowing the debt to continue. Some say if loan debts are forgiven, students will spend money on frivolous items instead of tuition. The many to pay off the student loans also comes from US taxpayers. It would be extremely negative to have taxpayers pay for the loans of students when most of them have already had to deal with or pay off theirs and the majority would rather pay taxes that go to schools over individual students. Another negative effect comes from the natural trend of increasing college tuition over the past thirty years. As the tuition has gone up, so have debts and if the debts are being forgiven, all of it gets put on the responsibilty of the colleges. Increasing college debts would significantly decrease the quality of the schools because more money would be spend paying debt than on actual education.]]>

For example, students with forgiven debt will accumulate more college debt. Additionally, in the past 30 years, the cost of tuition for public four-year colleges has grown by 357 percent, meaning that as college debt increases, prices will continue to rise rapidly. Approximately $1 trillion of the present $1.2 trillion in student debt is linked to student loans, essentially meaning that American taxpayers are paying for the students to accumulate debt rather than the students themselves. With debt amnesty combined with the rising prices of public college tuition, taxes will see a heavy increase, potentially counteracting the debt amnesty over time. If the heavy load of college debt is lifted off the shoulders of students, they may develop poor spending habits and, rather than saving money in bank accounts, could frivololously waste their money on unnecessary items. However, this can only apply on a case-by-case scenario. Not all students are irresponsible with their money, and could spend their extra funds that they can retain with the debt amnesty on school supplies or tutoring to ensure an optimal education.]]>

One of the major concerns with this solution is that US taxpayers will no doubt end up paying off all of the student debts instead of the students and thier families paying them off themselves. The fact that the taxpayers are going to have to pay for someone elses education does leave a bad image for those who are looking for a higher education but in no doubt will end up kickstarting the economy for the job market is looking for those who have college degress to be hired into major companies. Some even argue tha paying off these student loans will only end up with college students managaing to accumulate more debt in the long run of their student career. In a sense that may be true but, with most of the deb being wiped away leaves much to the hope of being able to pay away the debt that is still left over rather than having to come up with a sum total of over $20,000.]]>

The idea of colleges taking the student's college debt is risky because the forgiveness may encourage students to make loans for future, post-college purchases and frivolous idems. Also, U.S. taxpayers will be forced to pay for the college debt, which will be made even more exorbitant by the students' miscellaneous spending through college loans. In the end, the idea of colleges accepting the students' debt will no doubt be abused, and taxpayers will pay for it.]]>

Furthermore, not only is this debt harmful to the student, but also to taxpayers.

Debt forgiveness may give the impression that similar loans may also be forgiven, &amp; creates a problem for future debts that are accumulating. Also, this gives college students more money, which may or ay not be used appropriately, especially when it comes to paying for college tuition, allowing more spending on frivolous items. Student debt cost is now at $1.2 trillion, $1 trillion comes from federal student loans, meaning actual tax payers are paying for students debts &amp; not the students. Over time, 30 years to be exact, public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357% which is an astounishing number.

College is so expensive, even with the right scholarships, that even though they might have a chance to get it, they won't be able to stay if they can't pay for it. The average minimum wage job can only earn so much, and it would take years and years of working to even pay off the smallest fraction of, say, a $20,000 loan. Between school and work, there's not much time for the student to spend their money on 'frivolous' things, and it will really stress the student out. If taxpayers are paying for student debts, it's time we change the ridiculous amount it takes to go to college. The last generation had to work only a summer to pay off their classes. Now? It takes years.]]>

Lowering the college tuition would help bring more students into the colleges, give people a higher chance of a better education thus creating a more productive work force. But, if the students who are currently enrolled are in debt than giving them a debt forgivness on all of their education, is simply obsered. Lowering the debt may be more understandable and make college education better but I wouldn't go as far as saying erase the debt payments. About $1 trillion of the currrent $1.2 trillion in the student debt is in federal student loans. This means that US taxpayers are paying for the students debt rather that students and families paying for it. So, debt forgiveness and lowering college payment fees will also lower taxes causing family living easier.]]>

Those who truly desire a solid education and to reach a high rank in their field are highly unlikely to be irresponsible with their money. Besides tuition, students need to pay for books, supplies, and housing, so any and all money saved would be invested into items that enhance their education. Also, knowing how expensive college is and how much of a help it is to not have such a large financial burden regarding tuition, students would express an ample amount of gratitude. If some students happen to use a portion of their money on things some may see as unneccessary or frivolous, these items will likely help their grades and overall college experience because they could act as an escape. The stress of college and life takes a toll on students, so they would need to buy a few small things to relax. With less worry regarding tuition, students can enjoy their college experience and prosper in an environmant not plagued by future debt.]]>

Also, students' loan bills are paid over time, and the banks work with the students to help figure out a plan that best fills their needs.

A major criticism about this &quot;debt forgiveness&quot; plan is that students will expect similar loans to be given in the future, leading to more young adults applying to college which will result in a higher student loan debt. Another concern is that once that loan debts are forgiven the college students will not spend their money on tuition or items necessary for college, but rather spend it on frivolous items. Public 4-year college tuiton has increased by 357 percent in the past 30 years, and it is a continuing trend because more and more people keep applying and attending four year colleges. US teaxpayers are currently paying for students debt rather than for students and families which is not just, we need to find a solution to this student debt before anything too dire and drastic happens.]]>

Such a mentality also influences the students to spend more money on frivolous items since they have no debts to worry about paying off; if they had such debt, they would most likely learn to be smart financial adults with positive economic awareness. Most importantly, with college debt forgiveness, students are passing the burden of their debts onto US taxpayers, including themselves. So they are, in actuality, forcing harsher conditions onto the American population with their exuberant educational needs. In addition, the rising cost of college expenses, with the implementation of college debt amnesty, will put enormous strains on public universitys' effectiveness in delivering quality education.]]>

With the debt on the line, it is harder for them to pay them off because of the interest that is added on to them. Many may argue saying that their debt should be forgiven to a certain extent. They believe that they stressed enough in school to get the degree that they wanted and should not have to worry about paying these loans. The reality of it is that if these students loan debts are forgiven, the colleges will be in a higher debt. This can highly affect a campus because many more students will want the same thing to happen to them and the college will have to be fair and the debt will just keep increasing. Not only does this affect a college, but it also affects taxpayers. This has an effect on them to because they are indirectly helping the studebnts pay off their debt rather than the students him or her self. Their loan debts should not be forgiven no matter the circumstances because if they were the ones that took up all the loans, they should be able to face the consequence of the money interest rates.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[If the debt amnesty program is passed, opponents are worried that not only amnesty is given to the current group of students asking for loans to pay tuition, but also to previous students who have entered into college with a school loan, causing more of the debt for students to increase exponentially. Opponents also argue that about $1 trillion dollars of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is from loans, meaning that U.S. taxpayers are now paying for their debt and not their families. In the last thirty years, cost of going to a public college for four years has grown extremely rapidly at around 357%, forcing students to pay more of their debt as they continue going to school at the college. Finally, opponents also believe that allowing students to be given money under the amnesty program will give them for free reign into spending their money on not needed items, and not towards books and supplies needed for their classes. The cons of having a amnesty program can have a variety of consequences to the students and even the local state and federal government, as the debt will increase sharply and having more taxpayers pay more than what they're supposed to be paying.]]>

One potential problem is students who get debt forgiveness will think that in the future similar loans will be forgiven. This would be bad becasue it would cause them to be careless with their loans. Another problem is if loan debts are forgiven, some students will spend money on frivolous items, not tuition. The students will have all this money and at their age where they're not completely responsible, they might spend it on things they want but don't really need. The main reason we need debt amnesty is becasue in the last thirty years the cost of a four- year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent which means that students add more debt to pay for colleges continuing trend.]]>

For example, forgiving college debt will accumulate more debt in the future. Forgiving college debt can possibly make students irresponsible in the future, and eventually will spend money on frivolous items, not on tuition. Aside from that, all the money that goes into college tuition is coming from taxpayer money. In order to stop others from paying this debt, we have to make the students pay off what they were using. Forigiving the student loan will be more damgaing than helpful because collge tuition has grown 357 percent, which add mores to the debt.]]>

This concern can be simply dealt with by making the boundaries for this program very clear. The opposition also contends that students will spend money on frivolous items, rather than tuition, in the event that the amnesty plan goes through. If the plan's guidelines are specified in a way that doesn't permit students to purchase anything unrelated to their college education, then this problem can also be avoided. Still people would argue that most of college debt is already being payed for by US taxpayers and it is not necessary to provide any addiional aid beyond that. Unfortunately, thousands of college graduates are still in severe debt and do need help. Another popular argument is that student college tuitions continuously rapid growth of (357% in the last 30 years) results in more debt which means that students will have larger debts than they did previously. Though this is true, the student debt plan is a necessary step towards preventing a perpetuating cycle of student debt and moving towards a better futue.]]>

A student would, for example, accumulate more debt since they know that the debt will be forgiven anyways. They will be willing to waste money, on unnecessary expenses, rather than on their tuition. In addition, granting amnesty will burden US taxpayers, because they will be expected to pay the money from the federal loan. Lastly, granting debt amnesty will not help pay for college loan, because the cost for college tuition has increased by 357% already. The debt will continually increase, students will continue not paying the debt.]]>

The potential problem in this is that debt forgivness sets precedent that similar loans in the future will also be forgiven which accumulates to more college debt. If loan debts are forgiven, some students will spend money on luxuries instead on tuition. About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans which mean US taxpayers are paying for the student's debt instead of the students &amp; families. In the last 30 years, the cost of a public four-year college tuition has increased by 357 percent which means that students add more debt to pay for college. It sets into a continuing trend, but with getting debt amnesty, a student won't have to pay college loans.]]>

We may not know whether or not the person is serious about college but thats why we should observe them and see if they are spending their time and money well otherwise, a test should be made and given to see if they really care. If US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than students &amp; families then they should decided whether or not if they want to help anymore or rather help guide these people, tell the student to work towards scholarships. Students should work on scholarships in highschool, before college so they can pay whatever they can off.

When given the loan, students may use it on frivolous items instead of using it to pay for their tuition. Students use the money to buy other college extras such as buying a car, dorm goods, electronic devices-- things that will be beneficial to have, but not necessarily needed to live a college life. As a result, the students therefore end up relying on student loans resulting in the US tax payers to pay for their college debt. Also it is not okay to get into the habit of recieving the loans. One forgiven loan may trigger a feeling of assurance that the next loan will also be forgiven and then end up using all their money with a bigger debt left in store. It is important to know the limitations of the forgiveness in debt and use the money wisely]]>

And that means that they are not paying for what is important which is the students and their family. The money that students are using to pay off loan debt could be greatly used to pay off something even more important to a graduating college student. Once students are out of college they need a place to live. With their student debt it is hard for them to be able to do that because of their constant paying for their college even AFTER they have graduated.]]>

If college was cheaper to get into it'd probably be the best option for alot meaning more people can afford to go to college, and have a better education system for young people to become something later on. A college debt can also be a huge bump in someones life to slow them down from what they can fully become due to whats owed. As a high school student i have plans to go to college but a huge reason i second think or doubt going is because of how expensive it is, but if its possible and reasonable id be more then willing to go. This could also be another reason many other high school students dont get into college or look into it because many are struggling enough, with high priced colleges is what makes us lower educated making it hard for us to find many jobs but so is being in a extreme debt to get into jobs that might not even be available due to the tough job market.]]>

If you are leaving us in debt before we could even graduate school then how are we supposed to get good jobs, support our children, and live out our dreams. I am not saying you have to give us the easy way out, but we do need some help. If school is not our #1 priority as a country then how do we expect to advance as a whole?

I think its a great idea that they proposed a deal if you have a 2.5 or higher they lift the debt from you.

One of which being the fact that forgiven college debt will promote more college debt: debt forgivness sets precedent that similar loans in the future will also be forgiven. Thus, creating an adverse effect that would persist to decline only as time increased. With the current mediocre economy conditions, money can not be utilized as a toy. Forgiving students loan debts, allows the possibility to emerge that the student will spend federal money on frivolous items, instead of the intended purpose of tuition. Due to this, it can be agreed that allowing students amnesty for college debt might potentially make the economy succeptable for a decifit that could reach epidemic proportions.]]>

In my opinion i do not believe the government would allow those kind of actions after this proposal being passed because of the harm it can do. The group opposing the proposal also conclude that the students will start spending the money on frivolous things instead of tuition . I believe that is false because the students would not want to fall under even more debt and the government can pass a law forbiding them from spending their money on useless things. Lastly, groups against the debt forgivness plan argue that in the last thirty years, the cost of a public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent. That means that students add more debt to pay for college and sets a continuing trend. With the new proposition they will get a fresh start to pursue their goals and contribute to the economy instead of being in debt to it their whole lives.]]>

One thing a student might do, is spend the tuition money on something that's not needed. Students could buy clothes, or any uncessary items. Most college and high school student's would just put the money towards things that are relative to school. The student loans have went up because of students wanting an higher education, so it would cost more. The amnesty debt is less and students wont have to pay as much, it would be affordable for students to get in this program. If students get amnesty, one can get into college debt for free. Students with a GPA over 2.5, will be excused for student debt problems. College debt is taking over, if there were no college debt, college would be more afforable for every student.]]>

It is important to thrive for debt forgiveness which would set the precedent that similar loans later will be forgiven. Forgiven debts promote not following through, that is not a positive concept for kids who are in college. If the debts are easily accepted and forgiven, students could end up spending the money on unneccessary items instead of tuition because as of now there is no way to track their spending. Student debts account for one trillion of the dollars put in by tax payers toward the school system. In the last 30 years, public tuition for four year institutions ahs grown by 357 percent, this only means that students have more debt that will only bury them deeper into a hole. However, students need to be given the benefit of the doubt with their loans. The only way they would ever be able to pay the debts back is by succeeding in their education and being given a long period of time to get the money. It is not fair to expect the monies back so quickly leaving the students deeper and deeper into a bottomless pit of them not being able to finish college or be so deep in debt that there is no chance of redeement.]]>

Also, it is more worthwhile for that money to become debt then having students buy frivolous items that they don't nessascariy need, which is also a loss. Finally, students aren't paying off for most of their debt. There is about $1.2 trillion in student debt, and approximately $1 trillion is in federal student loans, so US taxpayers are technically paying for the majority of student debt, which is unfair, especially when those taxpayers could have used that money to pay other bills or supply things for their family.]]>

This will not be a good investment for the economy it is also not fair. If the students are forgiven for their debts then the money they may get from college will more than likely be put to bad use. The students will not prioritize their money right and spend it on the wrong things. It is also not fair for students under a 2.5 GPA to have to pay back every single debt they had. I feel that if they want to make a better way for students not to have to pay so much debts back they should make the rule for everybody and not just those with GPA's of 2.5 and higher.]]>

One of the major negative effects would be that college students won't have the responsibility of having to pay their debts; instead, they &quot;spend money on frivolous items, not on tuition&quot;, notes one credible source. Since college students are just moved out and have a newfound freedom, they aren't going to be spending their money wisely-and that's when they have tuition to pay. Imagine if they didn't have to pay that $20,000 a year-they'd be going crazy with all that money! Giving college students debt forgiveness won't be a good idea because they won't spend the money properly. In addition, the colleges themselves will be is tremendous debt if they paid for their students' tuition. And who pays for this debt? The taxpayers do. According to another highly credible source &quot;about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans/this means US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than students and families&quot;. This upsets many of the taxpayers because this money should be going to public projects that will benefit ALL of the community, not just a small portion of it. Some would say giving debt forgiveness is a great idea. They say it would promote more attending college. But it's not a good idea because more and more state debt would be accumulated.]]>

Due to this, the amount of debt accumulated nationwide would continue to grow exponentially and there would be no one to pay for it but US taxpayers. Another issue that the opponents have with the proposal lies within the credability of the scholars. They speculate that some students will spend money on frivolous items and not on their tuition, thus, wasting money that could be used for greater purposes. But what the opponents do not realize is that over the last 30 years the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent and climbing. With this students have to pay more and more for their education, accumulating more college debt over time. With debt amnesty, this detremental trend would cease to exist and scholars would be able to pay for their college loans.]]>

Colleges who forgive the majority of students pay a tremendous cost because their debts accumulates which leads them to increase the tuition rate. The economy's prosperity is something everyone is worried about and by allowing student debts to go unotticed the majority of taxpayers would be paying for the student's debt rather than families. College students learn how to be responsible becuase they know they know they have to pay their debt, but what happens when they do not have a debt? The students would spend their money on unimportant things rather than tuition. All in all, forgiving student's debt can be the wrong way to go.]]>

I can see where they are coming from but i do not think this is a good idea. If all these students dont have to pay their debt thats all good for them but what about the teachers? How are they going to get paid if the school has no money. If you think about it when the student signed up they knew what they were getting themselves into, they knew how much it costs. So they shouldn't get a break they should have to pay just like every one else. I can see how this might be rewarding to them for getting good grades but they shouldn't get special treatment and not have to pay just because of that.]]>

Instead of continuing to work hard, students will spend their money on personal items instead of saving and being smart with their money. U.S. taxpayers are putting their money towards student debt because they cannot pay off their loans for college tuition when taxes should be going towards other things that they are responsible for in the community. Because of the vast increase in the cost of college tuition over the past thirty years, college students rely on loans and debt forgiveness and that has become the new trend within the college community. While I believe that college costs should definitely be lowered and students should recieve help, they still need to work hard and not expect their education to simply be handed to them.]]>

For example, potential debt forgiveness sets precedent that similiar loans in the future will also be forgiven. This precedent may lead to student to accumulating more college debt or spending their money on frivulous items. Second, some may argue that it is unfair that tax payers will pay off student loans. However, about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans this means US taxpayers are already paying for students' debt rather than students and families. Thirdly, the college tuituion has gone up, making college debts greater and more overwhelming. Over the last 30 yrs./cost of public four-yearcollege tuition has grown rapidlt by 357 percent, meaning that students add more debt to pay for college/ sets continuing trend-get debt amnesty and won't have to pay college loans.]]>

The forgiveness of debts will eventually lead to a domino effect, for example, forgiven college debt will promote the accumulation of more college debts. In fact in the last 30 years the cost of a public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent, that means students will continue adding more debt to pay for college. The majority of the debt, already, isn't being paid by students. About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans meaning that US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than the students and families. If the loan debts are forgiven, some students will eventaullt spend their money on frivoulous items, and not on tuition. So why should the American people continue to help students pay even more tuitions, once the program is passed, if they will get lazy to pay the even the reduced price?]]>

Students with loan debt forgivness may have the temptation to spend money on frivolous items, not on tuition. Another problem with debt forgiveness is that $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in students debt is in federal student loans, this means US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather that students and families. The last issue with student debt is the percentage rate of collage tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent. Although the student debt forgiveness is an ipealing idea it has many flaws to go against it.]]>

Some may say students that have a grade point adverage above 2.5 should have their debt forgiven.However if the debt is forgiven, it gives students the ability to spend their money on unnessary items. If a student takes out a loan to attend college and knows their debt might be forgiven, they may not use their money wisely. Instead of the student paying off their debt they may just ignore it due to the fact of it being forgiven. If student debt are &quot; forgiven&quot; means students are not going to have the burden of paying their debt but tax payers will. Tax payers will be paying for a student's debt, the tax payer might have not attend college due to the burden of not having enough money, but somehow they now have to pay for a student that may have not been responsible with their money. If students know their debt is going to be forgiven they will accumulate it they will continue to purchase &quot; college materials&quot; and not have the burden of paying back their debt.]]>

However, forgiving student loans doesn't promote the idea that other debts will be forgiven in the future, it promotes the idea that if you work hard you can get to the place where you no longer have to worry about your debt. Opponents of the program believe that if college debts are forgiven, students will have the idea that other loans in the future will be forgiven. They also believe that forgiving the debt will encourage students to spend money on unneccesary items. For precautions however, when a debt is forgiven certain restrictions can be implemented to ensure that students use money on school related items. The amnesty program opponents also are concerened that federal student loans are paid by tax payers rather than by the students and families. Although this is a good point, the families and students also pay taxes since they are US tax payers, so they are helping pay off the loan. Lastly, the opponents stated that a &quot;trend&quot; of not having to pay college loans would begin.

Then you probably think students should have to pay their own debts and some reasons for you thinking this would be because you had to pay off your own debt so why shouldn't they have to, or us taxpayers shouldn't be paying off their debt for them because it teaches them responsibility and because we have enough to pay for so why would we want to pay off their debt. People that need to get a job and pay off their debts while still trying to live comfortably might need some help so why not help them and give them kindness so one day somebody might want to help you. I mean if you were in their spot wouldnt you want somebody to help you so you can live comfortably and have a family that you can support without worrying about student loans?]]>

Students who can not afford college, should think if student loans would be the best reliable option for them. All the loans hold a burden on everyone, whether or not it is the student who owes the money. Debt should not just be forgiven, because they had made the choice to go knowing if they were able to pay the loans. Basically giving into the students telling them it is alright not to be held responsible for anything you are wanting to do. Everyone is going to have hard times, and everyone will find a way to get through it. From my point of view students should be responsible for paying student loans back, because it shows they are willing to work for what the want.]]>

For example,they might spend the loans on non academic items, putting those colleges in a lot of debt. Another argument is that if you loan out money to one person, it will become a popular option for most college students. About one trillion dollars in student debts is payed in federal loans. This might take away from payment for families and other students. Although opponents argue these, there are positive outcomes. Many people never had or will get a college education due to lack of finance in their home. If given the opportunity to have a higher education, many would jump at it. Their future would be brighter and full of happiness. Not only would they get a better job, but it would also provide a better life for their future families.]]>

The essential problem to forgiving loan debts is that in the future, more debt loans will be forgiven which will only add on to the already problematic college debt. Some students will also spend their money on unnecessary items since they will not hold te responsibility of paying back loans. Most of the loans given were federal student loans, which mean US tax payers are actually paying off these loans rather than the students themselves. The cost of public college tuition has risen about 357 percent in the past 30 years, and if students add more debt to pay for college this will just set a trend; the trend to get debt amnesty and not paying loans back. Therefore, granting debt amnesty will have negaticve effects because it will put the US economy into a debt that can possibly go on for years.]]>

About $1 trillion of the accumulated $1.2 trillion of student debt is from federal student loans, if that amount of debt is forgiven by colleges the government must still find a way to recieve the money owed.

This is not always true, if we give these students a break, i believe it could really benifit them. If a students has optainted a grade-point average of 2.5 and over, obviously these loans are being put to good use. The stress of exams and college living is enough without a loan hanging over their heads. The students are our future, it's our responibility to give them the tools that they need to be successful. So many students have to drop out of college and get a job just to pay off these loans. Now, if every college student in debt had to do this, how do you see our future? i assure you it would be more bleak than if we just give these students a break. They just need a hand up, and as americans, it is our job to reach out our hands and pull them up.]]>

Even though all these point can be possible this program is needed for the many students that want to achieve a larger success but are restrained due to the fear of dept. Bringing this program will allow student to have more confidence in persuing their dream and not having to worry about money problems which can stimulate our economy evern more.]]>

However I would disagree because as most college students have jobs, they are paying taxes, therefore still paying on their debt but in an indirect way. Also, if kids begin getting scared of attending college because of the lasting financial struggles that will ensue, then we will suffer a wave of uneducated high school graduates looking for work in a world that wants college graduates. The solution lies in making college more affordable and providing more scholarships instead of loans.]]>

If loans debts are forgiven, students will spend the money on frivolous itmes, not on tuition. They should make a rule if your parents make a spesific money you would not have to pay back to the goverment because you don't have the money to pay back that the government gave to you and if your parents make alot of money you have to pay back because you have the money to pay back. Increasing the debt you have after college, students will think about if it is worth it going to college and have a debt that would take you year to pay it back. That's why most of the student rader work after college and they would no have any debt they would be worried and trying to think how they going to pay it. The colleges and goverments would have to think in other ways to no have debts or if you have debt make a easy way to pay them back.]]>

Student loans should be reduced, so that people can spend it on their own things. Having to spend that much money is ridiculous and sometimes people don't have the money to pay for it. However, If student loans are forgiven, forgiven college debt will promote accumulating more college debt. Studies show that about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans. This means that US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than students and families. Also, in the last 30 years, the cost of a public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 375 percent, therefore, the students add more debt to pay for college. This is not right because people that go to college shouldn't have to worry about how to pay off all that extra money, but instead they should focus more on getting the classes they need to start working in the work force. So, instead of making students pay more for their collgege debt, let them live comfortably and let them thrive and work for their dream job.]]>

If debts are forgiven, students could possible spend money on items that are unimportant, instead of on tuition. Opponents say that about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt in in federal student loans. Meaning, US taxpayers are paying for students' debts instead of the students and their families. In the last 30 years the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown by 375 percent. This means that students add more debt to pay for college. Getting debt amnesty will set a trend of not having to pay college loans. These and many much more are reasons why debt forgiveness is not a good idea.]]>

If loans were given freely, there would also be a massive increase in spending that is not towards the individual's tuition. Along with this, instead of the loans being paid by the person recieving the education, the colleges would be paid via tax payers.

It would be very wise and effective if students get the forgiving policy. Why? Well more student will be influence into wanting to go to college because they wouldn't have to worry about having enough money to pay classes or if it will be of more convinence to get lower classes in order to have the money needed and also since the policy stats only students with an average of 2.5 will be able to get forgiveness then more students will be willing to work hard and study more to get a good average. Then ofcourse some students might take advantage of this policy and it wouldn't be as wise anymore. So if this happens im sure the policy will change and the average will either be higher or only certain students who actually need this policy will recieve it.]]>

However, the only reason this is even an issue in the first place is because for some reason education in America is expected to be fully paid for by the student. Education is something that should be available to everyone, and should be funded by the taxes that American citizens pay. It would only be a few cents more on everyone's purchases in order to help students get the education they deserve, which in the end will do more good for the economy than harm. (Some feedback on this test: writing paragraphs?? really? if you're going to have a place for paragraph writing at least give me more sources and and information to back up my point.

Some students would take advantage of the new policy. Although the debt might cause stress on students, its crucial to have them pay back the debt. Paying the debt can teach life skills such as financial conduct, along with financial management. By enforcing a forgiven debt policy, these skills will be lost to those it would normally effect. Students are less likely to spend money on things needed when debts are forgiven.]]>

Because about 1 trillion of the student loans are federal, the forgiveness of student debt will cause the taxpayers to foot the bill instead of students and their families. Not only will the cost come from taxpayers, but when the debts are forgiven, those who oppose the debt forgiveness believe some students will then spend money on frivolous items, rather than tuition. The opponents also worry that with a precedent sent to forgive debt, then other students in the future will rely on the possibility of forgiveness, and rack up more debt.]]>

The ones who do have the money are often faced by family problems, death of a spouse,paying bills, and even something small as paying for food. forgiving a students debt would be great to the economy. With free education and the forgivness of those who owe student loans we wil start helping the lower class into someone be out of poverty and at least get into the middle class(not poor but not exetremely wealthy). take this and considerate how great would this be to our economy.]]>

Student debts keep students from spending money frivolously on items they do no need instead of on tuition or essential items to get them through college. If the state forgives the collage debts of the students that take them out then they will be promoting the use of student loans to get though college. If that were to happen students would just take out loans knowing that there were no reprocussions. Student loans teach many students the valuable lesson of saving money and not spending it frivolously.]]>

Therefore, a lot of teens get the bigger picture and save up college tuition to attend college classes. Also working part time and going to school as well is a very good way to start off your freshman year in college. The more people who have jobs and can pay their way through college instead of being in debt are more likely to succeed. It may be tough for some teens in high school to get a job or might be too busy to even have at least an hour a day to look for a job.]]>

For instance, forgivien college debts promote the accumulation of more college debt. In addition to that, about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans, which means IS taxpayers are paying for studets' debt rather than students and families. Lastly, within 30 years, the cost of a public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357%. This concludes that students add more to their debt.]]>

If the student can not afford the college in the first place and did't recieve a scholarship of money, they need to re-evaluate their choice of schooling.

The government already owes &quot;about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt&quot; so paying for students debts would only accumulate the financial stuggle the nation is attempting to extricate itself from. Rather than benefiting students and the government, granting students debt amnesty only causes national debt and tax prices to rise because colleges will be surrepitiously feeding of the governments money since &quot;college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent&quot; which in result will cause the students to pay higher taxes to balance the debt caused by their enrollment in college. Ultimately, it is best for the government to allow students to worry about their college debt so the nation doesn't fall victim to the greed of colleges causing the economy to plummit and the national debt to exceed a point of no return.]]>

For one, it creates a type of lifestyle that allows achieving and not paying back a natural instict. Every human should be able to accomidate to their own responsibilties, and providing loans in the future, will create further foregiven loans. If students dont take their own responsibility, they take thigns for granted and spent money on things less benefical. Schools provide aid in order to help the better of the group, but instead if you allow debt to be forgiven then you give students the easy way out. With more enrollements, means more debt, so therefore the more one can sustainabily be able to fix a problem, the more postive attributes will arise.]]>

Also, since this money is suppied from the government, citizens will be susceptible to higher taxes and be forced to make up for the amount of money being lost. This is unfair to people who are already supporting a student of their own. Plus, the cost of college has grown rapidly and students will just be adding more debt to themselves and will most likely get debt amnesty as well.

Another concern would be where money would be spent, if not on college tuition, but in fact when students buy other things in the community or in stores that tax, they are paying for their debt and other's. Numbers say that about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans, which means that US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than the students themselves or their families. The cost for a public four-year college has grown by 357 percent in the past 30 years]]>

This could effect them if they accumulate more college loans, and don't expect to pay them off, or if, once they graduate, they accumulate credit card debt and don't expect to pay it off, hoping for another amnesty. It would also be unfair to those who have paid off their college debt, having lost years worth of pay to get rid of it, as well as taxpayers, many of which have debts of their own and not appreciate their money going towards those who will never pay back their, now, unexistant loans.]]>

People might say that since students are saving more money then they will feel okay to buy other items, and will not have enough money for their tuition. I believe that yes there will be a few people that will not save wisely and spend mney, but on the other side there will be many people that will take advantage of the opportunity and will be able to get the education they deserve witghout hacving the stress of becoming indebted. People might also say that students are not actually paying for college debt because $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal loans which means US taxpayers are paying it. The truth of the matter is that student are indeed the ones paying for college and their debt proves that.]]>

However, because students would no longer be burdened with paying debts in excess of $20,000 after graduating, they would be able to support a comfortable lifestyle sooner, and sooner be able to contribute more to the taxbase for future students. In addition, opponents argue that if loan debts are forgiven, students will spend their money on frivolous items rather than tuition. What these opponents do not realize is that most of the students' money would go into supporting their basic necessities such as shelter, food, and utilities. What is left should be able to be spent freely, as America is based on a free market economy, and people should be able to spend their money as they please, not be held in debt slavery.]]>

The potential problem is that debt forginemess sets precedent that similar loans in the future will also be forgiven. For example, forgiven college debt promotes accumulating more college debt. If loan debts are forgiven, some students will spend money on frivolous items, not tuition. About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans. This means US taxpayers are paying for students' debts rather than students and families. In the last 30 years, the cost of public for-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent. This means that students add more debt to pay for college. There will be a continuing trend to get debt amnesty and won't have to pay college loans.]]>

All young adults should have the right to attend college and to pursue their interests, without having to worry about student loans. If anything, an amnesty program is simply correcting a fault that has been made in over charging students for their educations. About one trillion dollars of this debt is in federal student loans? Great; the government can now pay back its students for the money they wrongly stole. The money given back to the students will have to come from the peoples' tax dollars?

This would train students to lose a sense of responsibility as they can accumulate more debt without realizing the growing debt problem. In addition, if the debts are amnestied, then students will have excess money that they may spend on unnecessary goods rather than putting money into an institution that would better society. Furthermore, if the government decides to forgive student loans, then US taxpayers are forced to shoulder the load, forcing citizens to pay about $1 trillion worth of debt. Finally, with progressing times, college education has grown to be an expensive expenditure, growing over 357% in the recent years. By creating a debt amnesty, students will start a cycle of not paying for college, thus making future generations carry the burden.]]>

If we forgive the college debt in could create the potential problem of students accumalation more college debt. This is a good point, if we allow students to have their debt forgiven we might just end up with more debt and will only lead to more problems. Another problem would be the students spending the money on pointless items instead on tuition. This sets a good argument, if the students have the extra money they should spend it on their education, not on any pointless intem. The money should go to whats most important and right now education is the most important thing. Another thing is that $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is being payed by tax payers. The debt that has been acumalated by college is being payed by tax payers for the students, instead of students, and family. The last agrument is that over the past 30 yeats the cost of public college tution has grown 357% abd that means that studencts add more debt to pay for college and it sets a continuing trend. Students who get amnesty wont have to pay for college and that would lead to the previous problems. As you can see the opposing side has a good point in not wanting college amnesty and has the facts to back up their view.]]>

Also if we forgive the debts, its possible some students might buy more items that have nothing to do with tuition since the debt is going to be erased. The taxpayers also would be the ones paying for this debt because most of the loans are federal. finally in the last 30 years we have had a increase in college tuition by 357 percent which means that college is getting more and more expensive and loans are getting bigger and bigger and harder to forgive.]]>

By forgiving the student debt, it may also give freedom to many other debts which would be a major problem for the schools. Students will also be tempted to spend their money on useless items, rather than on tuition or school supplies. Citizens would be furious as well since their the people paying for the students debt. As very leniant and forgiving it is by letting these students back in, there will also be many disadvantages as well.]]>

Colleges ask for the money not to put in their pockets, but to use the money for the need in colleges. For example food, books, wages etc.The money is crucial too keep the college up and running. Also as a high school student you know that college is alot of money. You need tpo start saving from way before college. A solution can be in payments, but not to forget completely about the debt.

They won't be happy with just one thing out of the way they'll want more debt taken off their plate, and in turn it will give the college itself more debt to pay off itself. Students will go off and accumulate more debt somewhere else if forgiven a debt for one thing. If students are forgiven a loan, they wont go and spend it wisely on another loan or on hings they need for school, they will spend it on frivolous items, surely not tuition. Students and families are paying off a minor portion of the debt they actually have, taxpayers pay about $1 trillion of the $1.2 trillion in student debt. College tuition has grown and continues to grow rapidly, in the last four years the tuition for a public four-year college grew 357 percent. This causes students to add more debt to pay to get through college, which sets a continuing trend.]]>

It is predicted that letting the college loans slide will create the mind set of a student who believes they can avoid paying back other loans in the future. Rather than decreasing the amount of debt among students, it would have the opposite effect and promote an increase in college debts. Also, if students are relieved of their debts, they will be more tempted to spend money on other items, not on their education. If that huge amount of weight on their shoulders is released, they will be more carefree and influenced by others to go out and spend more on extracurricular activities. It is known, too, that a large chunk of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is payed for by US taxpayers - not the student or the student's family. As the cost of college tuition increases, the amount of student debt is compounded tremendously, and not having to pay any of it at all will have devastating effects on the economy and eventually their futures in the work force.]]>

The schools need this money in order to make their schools better and continue to thrive as an elite school.

Although some students may go ahead and use the money for the actual debts they must pay, some may take it to buy on something else they think they need. It is not wise to trust loans to students who are only, at the most, 23 years old and don't really know how to use loans wisely. Also, the programs already used to aid students with paying off debt may not be harming the students, but they are harming the society. About $1 trillion of the $1.2 paid by tax payers is going towards college debts rather than something that may be more useful to the taxpayer himself. Using taxpayer money to pay off a debt of a student is simply teaching that student that he does not actually have to worry about his own debt, and that those around him will cover it for him. Giving too much aid to college students in debt overall will end up hurting our economy, not helping.]]>

Not only would it affect the college student, it may also affect there family. For example, the student's parents did not help to pay for the tuition because they did not have the money to. So the student got a loan and started to pay it off, but over time the student could not make enough money to support onesself and make the monthly payments on the loan.

Why not go out get a job and save up some money then go to college and be able to pay what you need for college so you never have to go into debt? Everybody thinks that you need to go to college right after high school or you wont get a good job. Well obviously you wont but how can you pay for college if you have no money? No source of income to help you pay for college. I mean college prices keep on rising but we cant do anything about that that is the colleges choice. Plus if you cant afford college why not then apply for some scholarships and maybe even get one that will maybe help you pay for some of college or maybe even all of college! This is what i believe should be put into everyones mind about college and what should be done with it if you get debt or cant afford it.]]>

One potential problem is that people fear that if students college debt is forgiven, it promotes accumulating even more college debt.

If this is the case the students will also be accumulating to more college debt, and not only will they be using it for their college things but also on things not neccesarly needed. Being forgiven a school loan can be a great thing for some but also a problem for others. Students should learn how to be paying fo their debts and being responsible as well as their families, because not always in life will they be fogiven a loan.

Student loans are there to help students get through college not creat more stress for them it is only when the student abuses a student loan that they end up in debt.

There is only a certain extent of people who would take amnesty of college loans for the good or the bad. It is then the college boards job to see who would suit that postion to be forgiven. Amnesty is not a bad thing, if not abused it could even benieft the student body greatly in their studies. The key concept here is the students is what matters not those proffesors that get payed a boat load to stand and lecture , although they play a major role it might be taken by one of his very students. Amnesty should be decided on both the logical and emotional side of the student trying to mbe forgiven. At the end of the day ask your self this question. What matters more the proffesor getting paid benifically or the student trying to get his education coming from little to no income household just to betterthemselves and there family's life even if that means jumping into the ocean of debt touching the ocean floor swimming back up and planting there foot on land knowing they have accomplished their life long dream and can move on to beniefiting from getting their college debt amnestied.Wow what a experince that would be!]]>

Not only that, but the extracurriculars may not be as up to par if the schools do not have enough money to premote it. Another potentical problem with amnesty is the potential for students to purchace non-academic items with their tutiton money. This specifically can me a mayjor issue when battling the &quot;party&quot; scene in colleges. Following that, more taxpayers will contribute to students schooling. This is an unfair issue for many American citizens who would rather see their money go to more beneficial things that will help their imideate lives rather than help the lives of random students accross the Unided States. Finally, the last 30 years per cost of public four-year college tuition has rapidly increased by 357 percent.

The preparation of high school students for the struggles of college must first be looked at in order to understand the problems occuring in the raised amount of loans for college students. First off, coming out of highschool, students have been working for years on end to accomplish honoring and unique titles or rewards that they could submit in their college applications. Also, GPA is a highly recommended nessesity for a good college to accept you. In addition, the SAT test (a test that can be easily passed successfully if you have th money to pay for the tutoring) is a nessessity for college applications in America. As a result, we should stop doing these pointless standardized tests that students get nothing out of and actually learn something. Which leads me to the question; why am I taking this worthless, confusing test right now. Thanks for your time and if someone is actually reading this I hope you take it into consideration that no one is going to try on these tests unless it ultimatly affects their future in college.]]>

The purpose of college is not only for academic education, but also to teach in life skills. Students need to learn to take responsibility for their own debts. If students don't have a debt to worry about, they will spend their money irresponsibly on unnecessary items. In addition, sources state that about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is from federal loans, which hands the responsibility of paying them off to US taxpayers rather than the students themselves. Along with the growing cost of tuition, debt is increasing rapidly. Debt forgiveness will trigger a cycle in which students will not have to pay loans, which could motivate them to be irresponsible, while educational and other public institutions lose funds.]]>

One discussion we had one evening, there was this girl who attended college and as well got her degree(s) that she needed to fulfill whatever job she desired. Come to find out she is working at McDonald's for a living even with her college degree's. Something isn't right. The economy is unorganized with their currency, they invest in the wrong things. It's like saying even with student loans, you still have to pay money back. Getting your education is too expensive in this day and age, it's only going to get worse.]]>

One of the main problems with this proposal is that it may promote the accumulation of more college debt as students further their education because similar loans will present themselves in the future. Another problem that is in coherence with this accumulation of this debt, is that, because the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown by about 357%, the government will have to absorb the student loan debts therefore increasing the federal debt defiecit. Also about 1 trillion of the current 1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans, whcih means that US taxpayers are paying more for student loans rather than other debts that the US experiences.]]>

This idea of just waving away debt would incourage students to splurge their money on personal iteams rather then their debts. Then the cost of those years in college for these students would pass on to U.S. taxpayers and add to the $1 trillion in federal student loans. Not to mention that the cost of a four-year college has gone up by 357%; Not only that, but it is feared that if students are forgiven for their debts it would promote taking on more college debt. Like many good solutions to a problem there are always two sides to every coin.]]>

Debt forgiveness can cause many issues fincially and economically. A potential problem that debt forgiveness may have is that it sets precedent that similar loans in the future will be forgiving. In addition, forgiving college debt promotes accumulating more college debt over time. Statistically about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans and this means that US taxpayers would be paying for students' debt rather than the student and their families. Furthermore, over the last 30 years the cost of going to a public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357%. That means that students are adding more debt to pay for college. This sets an ongoing trend that if a student gets amnesty they won't have to pay college loans. Therefore, giving students amnesty for college loans might not have such a great outcome. However, other students may argue that by getting amnesty for college loans they will complete college, actually be able to pay off any debt they have, and live comfortably.]]>

What experience will these children have growing up with the mentaility that all debt will be obsolved when yor pockets are feeling empty? Of the total $1.2 trillion dollars of current student debt, $1 trillion is in federal student loans, this means that US taxpayers are paying for the students' debt as is rather than their family or themselves. There have been programs and financial systems set up years before this amnesty that still continue to assist and improve these student's lives. What example are we setting when we allow these young adults to believe the burden is lifted?

Some students just go to college either for the experience or to find out what major they are looking for. Students who get scholarships to a college are very lucky because college is so much money and could put familys into serious debt problems due to the loans they take out to put their children into college. I dont understand why a college is so expensive and how they don't think about what they could cause a family to go through. Each college should give every student a discount or a scholoarship for something a student does good. I don't like how colleges only pick the best athletes or geniuses and give them a scholoarship. Every student should be treated as equals. Each student has to have something good in them for a scholorship other wise how else did they continue into college. My point is not everyone in life is wealthy and for a college to put so many families and students into debt due to loan difficulties its so unneccessary. I dont know how else to explain it in a better way. I hope im making sense.]]>

One problem is that forgiving debt on the college loan can set the precedent that more debt can be accumulated and there will be no penalty for that. The point they're trying to make by debt forgiveness is that they want kids to go to school and obtain a college degree, they just don't want this forgiveness to be used and abused. Another problem is that if loan debts are forgiven students will use the money towards extra activities instead of paying their tuition. In order for this debt amnesty program to work, the creators really need to think it through more to create a program in which students can only accumulate so much debt and that the money they're saving from the debt has to go directly into paying for their tuition.]]>

The large amount of debt accumulated equals about $1 trillion, which is not something that can easily be removed. Taxpayers are the ones that feel the effects of this, and not so much the students or the families. The average student's loan balance is over $20,000, and has grown rapidly by 357% in the last 30 years. This number will simply grow more in the future, and future generations can't expect their debt to be forgiven the same way it is now. It will create a reckless attitude among students and families who will grow comfortable with the idea of accumlating more college debt. Offering to forgive it only provides a short term solution, and in the long run will creat more problems.]]>

If loan debts are forgiven, some students will spend money on unimportant things instead of their tuition. They might chose to not follow through with their plan and not go to college. In the future, student's loans may rise, causing them to not want to go to college giving them all that excess money. In the last 30 years, the cost of public four year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent which means students are becoming overwhelemed with their debts. They could receive debt amnesty and won't have to pay their college loans. About one trillion dollars of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans.

In reality, they should be using that extra money now on tuition. Did you know that about $1 trillion of the student debt is in federal loans? That means that families aren't even paying for their debt; the US taxpayers are instead. Lastly, the cost of public four-year college tuition has increased in the last 30 years by 357 percent.

As soon as you find your career, the expense of student loans will even out and your job will pay those back and support a living. That is of course if you pick the right career where finding a job is abundant. The cons of going to college do not represent college as a whole, just variations of it. Finding a job as a lawyer is much harder than finding one as a nurse or nurse's aid and the sucess of paying back the loans is left to the type of career that person picks. Yes, it is a shame that people who are fresh out of high school cannot find a job, but it is the career path they choose, not the college.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Many people dissagree with the possible solution of offering a student dept amnesty program because of the possible problems that may result from it. for example, a small majority of americans feel that if this where to happen, students will spend money on frivolous items and not on tuition. This is vastly untrue. the meere fact that someone would suggest this is horrifyingly rude and injust. Many of the people who are saying this are the older generations, the people who got out of college debt free and who dont know what its like to have not only $20,000 in debt, but usually more considering the fact that even in jobs where people are needed, it istill is incresingly hard to find a job. The number 20,000 is largly false too. Colleges that I've been looking at are 60,000 A YEAR. The debt we face when leaving college isnt something that these older generations will ever have to deal with. older generations look at eachother and ask why we are so full of angst, why we are unhappy and angry when anyone says anything about the future. this is because we are faced not only with the struggle of debt, no job, no way to get a house, and unhealthy eating habits because we cant even AFFORD to by healthy food like vegetables that cost $6 dollars just for some spinach, we are also faced with people who say that we cant do it, they say that we are the generation that doesnt care about the world, that we are the generation that arent responsible enough to deal with the money problems that YOU, older generations, laid out for us. Who caused the economy to be this bad?? YOU, past generations like yourself who are giving us no option but to be depressed and anxious filled teenagers going into a college world where we know things will probably only get worse. Did you know that the higest suicide rates come from people college aged? have you ever put any thought into that? YOUR CHILDREN ARE GETTING SO DEPRESSED ABOUT THE MONEY PROBLEMS THAT YOU GAVE US THAT WE ARE FORCED TO TAKE OUR OWN LIVES, BECAUSE WE CANT PAY THIS DEBT. with the debt problems you are giving us, we cant pay it off. it is nearly impossible, unless we get a job right out of college. And that option just isnt even an option in this economy. we need a car to get to a job. Gas costs over $4 a gallon. how can we pay for that gas without a job? Our generation has become to rely on jobs like McDonalds purly for the fact that we know that everywhere else just isnt availible. And you know what? even McDonalds wont hire us because we are &quot;over qualified.&quot; so where does that leave college graduates? Homeless, jobless, moneyless, but you know what? at least we got our degrees, those wonderful slips of paper that represent the great ammounts of debt we own. A student debt amnesty program wont solve all these problems. but maybe, just maybe, we would be able to keep ourselfes afloat. maybe suicide rates would go down. maybe you wouldnt have to wonder why your precious grandaughter killed herself in college when at dinner you said the comment about &quot;wastefull teenagers sucking up our money and then being useless and not getting a job or a house or being productive.&quot; we are wastefull, yes. because you have built a system where we are forced to waste our money in college degrees, because if we dont, you say that we arent working hard enough, your generation says that we shouldve saddled ourselfs with debt just so you can say, &quot;oh, MY grandkid went to college.&quot; well you know what? we went to college. we got our med degree. now we are sitting here watching you get old and sick and watching someone just as qualified as us take care of you as we sit in puddles, lakes, oceans of debt-filled tears. if this didnt make you think that just maybe we wouldnt spend the little money we would then have from our crappy job (if we can even find a McDonalds that will hire us) on wastefull things, you are wrong. i dont want to spend my money on stupid jewlary or the newest jeans. im happy in my one nice &quot;work apropriate&quot; outfit. but maybe if we had that little bit of money, we could live somewhere instead of on the streets, maybe we could pay for good food, maybe we could be happy, maybe we could pay for the rest of tuition, maybe we wouldnt kill ourselfes, maybe we would save our money so that we could try and take care of you when you get old. maybe we would do that, if we had money. maybe, if we didnt have so much debt.]]>

Not to mention if these young adults dont have to worry about paying tuition, or college debt, then there is a very good chance that they will spend there money on frivolous items that arent as important as paying for college. Also, about 1 trillion of the current debt is in federal loans which means US tax payers are paying for students debt rather than the student and families which is not fair.

If loan debts are forgiven, some students will spend money on frivolous items, not on tuition. That is not what we want either. The last 30 years, cost of public 4 year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent which means that students add more debt to pay for college and sets a continuing trend.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[One effect of pardoning student loans for college student is it doesn't teach the youth of America how to pay back loans, and so many of these student may believe that futures loans can also be forgiven, but this isn't the case. Not only that but when the students are spending their money on tuition, they could be wasting their money on a less worthy cause such as a spa vacation, or really expensive shoes. This doesnt allow student to become more mature when handling their money. Also, if the students aren't paying for their college who is? Around 1 trillion dollars in student loans are federal student loans. How is this debt supposed to get paid back to our government? Well thats simple, tax payers are going to have to pay back students' debt rather than the families. That isn't fair either, families have to put their own children through school and pay back their own debt. The last thing most families need is higher taxes. Over the last 30 years there has been a major increases in college tuition costs, and when kids aren't paying back the debt the accumulate in college this may make college prices rise even higher for future generation. In all, students can't recieve a college education, and simply not pay for any of it. There will be consequences because these students will be saddling the economy and colleges with their debt instead of laerning how to properly pay off student loans.]]>

One potential concern is debt forgiveness sets a precedent that other college loans will also be forgiven, so there is no incentive for students to stop increasing their college debt in the future. Moreover, if the students' money is not spent on loans, some students will instead spend the money on useless items. Approximately $1 trillion of the present $1.2 trillion in student debt is from federal student loans, thus US taxpayers are providing the money for students' loans instead of the students themselves, which does not seem fair to the taxpayers. In the past 30 years, the cost of public four-year college has increased significantly by 357 percent. In conclusion, student debt for college is continuing to grow, since the cost of tuition for college is increasing, so students should get debt amnesty so that college debt does not prevent them from pursuing their dream career.]]>

However, this is not going to be true in most circumstances because a certain GPA is needed to get the debt excuses. Most students won't be albe to achieve that level of success in classes not pertaining to their major, because they won't have an interest. Others are concerned too much money will be spent on frivolous things, instead of tuition and neccessities for graduating. This can be solved if colleges only tuition, class and board debts.

About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans which means U.S. taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than the sudents and theur families. In the last 30 years the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357% which means that students add more debt to pay for college. This sets a continuing trend for students that get debt amnesty and won't have to pay college loans.]]>

The taxes in conneicut are already fearly high for the middle class, and with all these students earning a education we will be paying an incresingly large amount.

First of, the potential problem of debt forgiveness sets precedent that similar loans in the future will also be forgiven. Thus, the forgiven college debt will promote an accumulation of more college debt. Furthermore, if loan debts are forgiven, some students will spend their cash on frivolous items instead of using the money on tuition. This idea will lead students in wasting their cash. If this loan forgiveness policy is allowed, it will also mean that US taxpayers will be the ones paying for college tuition instead of the student and their families. This is negative in all the wrong reasons for the fact that some taxpayers do not even have children and so it means that they are paying for something that is not needed for them. Also, this means that more taxpayer dollars are spent on college tuition rather than something that will benefit society as a whole. All in all, loan forgiveness, although it means well, will have negative influences on other factors rather than the one positive reason that it was made for.]]>

This means that, you, a US tax payer are paying for student loans, rather than the students whom the loans belong too, even though you might have finished college and payed your student loans off. But if loan debts are forgiven, it'll promote accumulating more college debt. In the last 30 years the cost of a public four year college went up by 357%; get debt amnesty and these will not have to be paid. That's if you have a gpa of 2.5 or higher of course.]]>

Though some students would be trustworthy and responsible if their debt is forgiven, others may take advantage of the forgiveness in multiple ways. There is the possibility of them spending their money frivolously instead of paying for their tuition. Another thing that students might do if their debt is forgiven is accumulate more college debt instead of paying it off if they are under the idea that all debts, current and future, will be forgiven. Also, if college debts are forgiven, they would have to be paid for with tax payer money. If many students expect their debt to be forgiven, that would result in a higher student debt amount. If the debt that needs to be forgiven is higher, then that might result in tax increases, which is unfair to the taxpayers who's money is going towards this debt forgiveness.]]>

Besides, in the last 30 years college tuition has grown by 357%, which just adds to the students debt, but if they get debt amnesty they wouldn't have to pay the loans. However, it is possible that if debts are forgiven, students will be likely to spend the saved money on unnecessary items.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Opponents of the proposal calling for debt forgiveness contend that giving students amnesty for college loans will have several adverse effects. One of the first problems seen is that debt forgiveness sets a precedent that, in a students future, similar debts will be forgiven. Yet that is not how the real world works. In the real world a bank will hound you until they get your money, there is no such thing as forgiveness. If you have debt you must be willing to sacrifice everything to repay it, there is no bank that will be willing to forgive you. Also, if a student has nothing to repay they will most likely begin to spend money excessively, putting thmselves back into debt. Another good reason to not forgive student loans would be that $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans. That money was given to students out of the federal bank, the one supplied by US taxpayers. Most taxpayers have kids of their own to send to college, they should not have to pay for their kid to go plus some strangers kid, its just not right. Student debt may be a hard thing to handle, but in order to keep our future bright we can not allow student loans to be forgiven, and there should be no exceptions.]]>

Can they all say, &quot;that was worth the money?&quot; The money that does not go into tuition would most likely be spent on more trivial and probably even illegal items. Other technical issues arise from this matter. What if one person is in debt for fifty grand, and another for ten grand. If they are both exempt from paying their debts, the one who owed fifty grand has it much better. Many people would take advantage of this system by recieving more money, without having to pay it back.]]>

If the loan debts are forgiven then the students will spend money on items they don't need rather than on their tuition.

Over the last 30 years the cost of a public four-year college tuition hass grown by 357% which means that students add more debt to pay for college which sets a continuing trend of getting debt amnesty and not having to pay college loans.]]>

However becuse states had to set up a standerd score for the school to reach, schools had to spend more time teaching kids sience, math, reading &amp; writing, and thus they were forced to cut clases such as aout-body or wood shop, and in some cases gym. while at the same time expecting the kids to remeber every thing they had lerned for a test that would decied if they graduate or not. teachers had to stop helping the kids that actuly improve thier students abilities and fouces on an intituinolzied cerculume that hurt students more then it helpd. this is what i think of your test. it is a waste of time and money, whos compeneys get rich off making sure kids do bad in school. you can not messure ones knowledge with a stupid test. a kid can get A all year but flunks becuse of these stupid tests. our future of going to colloage is decided by a test that dosnt evean messure or knowlege so you can all go screw your selvs for all i care this is what i think. sure my spelling, grammer, and puncuation is bad but i can say it is becuse of you pepole who dont know how to teach. i will be clicking yes, no what ever at randome in potest of not just this test but every standerized test.

Some say that forgiving debt would only cause more problems because for example, many students might spend their money on frivilous items instead of tuition. Many people are also upset that they as taxpayers are paying for other students' debt instead of funding that would actually benefit them.]]>

In addition to this student loan debt will increase at a rapid rate if the students do not have to eventually pay it off. Lastly, the taxpaying American citizens are already paying for $1 trillion of the student loans that college kids have racked up. This shows that there is no need for the system to be put in place at all because most students are already not having to pay their debts off.]]>

However, because this test doesn't matter for anything, and I'm kind of pissed off due to the whole &quot;we did all of our mandatory testing already, except for this test, which actually doesn't mean anything, is really political bs that is being forced on us, and might not even be given next year in classes&quot;, I'm disinclined to acquiesce to your request that I take this test seriously. I will now proceed to fill in a bunch of C's for all of my answers, highlight/select everything, and write clever, unrelated responses to the questions which are asked of me. Good Day Sir/Madam ------------------------------------------------EDIT TO THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT-------------------------------------------------- ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME???? WHY ARE YOU RUINING SCIENCE FICTION AND SPACE TRAVEL ON THIS TEST???? Both are amazing, and there are dozens of awesome stories and universes (Star Wars, Star Trek, Dune, Foundation, Firefly, Ender's Game,etc) that have space travel as an intregal part of the plots. Space is cool, exciting, so is space travel, and yet on this test they are represented in the most dull, boring, mononotous way possible. That guys voice is so boring, it could easily push over some kids over the brink and into insanity. If your going to make us hate something, make us hate something worth hating, and stay the fuck away from things that are precious and awesome (ie Science Fiction, George Orwell, etc). And make the voices suck less. That is all.]]>

If students' debts are forgiven early on in life, students will go on thinking the debts later in their lives can be forgiven too. It is setting a bad example for young adults. The students who know their debts will be forgiven could get the idea to accumulate more debt, just because they dont have to pay for it. If students don't have to pay for their loans, then who does? About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is being paid for by U.S. tax payers. That number will only grow; in the last 30 years, the cost of public four year colleges have increased by 357%. Thats just more debt for the taxpayers to pay.

For example, by forgiving college debt, you are promoting even more accumulating debt resulting from college. Also, by forgiving these loan debts, the effect could easily be that the money students have will go towards more luxorious items, or unecessary items as opposed to paying for an education. Taxpayers may be effected in means of where their money is going and being used towards. Instead of their money being used towards students and families, it is going towards students' debt. This is about $1 trillion of the $1.2 trillion of the student debt in federal loans. The price of college isn't cheap and it continues to grow. In fact,in the last 30 years, tuition of a four-year college has increased a total of 357%.]]>

This creates a less responsible adult than if that student would have to pay off his student loans. Also, many students qualify for government grants for their schooling.

About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans in which US taxpayers are paying studens' debts rather than the students and their families. As a result, these students will take advantage of this opportunity, as it brings certain unneccessary thoughts into the students' minds. These students begin to expect more of their college debts to be forgiven soon in the future as well, as they begin to depend upon this situation. Apart from this, these students would even begin to spend their money on frivolous items instead of their tuition or neccessities. As this continues, students would gradually become careless when it comes to their college tuitions and debts.]]>

Most of the student debt is in federal student loans which will mean that U.S. taxpayers will be paying for students' debt that other important subjects. Over the last 30 years cost of public four-year tuition has risen nearly to 360 percent. This means that students add more debt to pay for college and when get debt amnesty they dont have to pay anything. However many student loans will need approval so if there are certain student loans it will not be forgiven. Students know better than to spend money on items they do not need if they are in debt. Students that do good in college and land a really good job in the job market can afford to pay off their debts.]]>

If they dont it will cause problems for the university, the public, and the nation. They are not any different than any other loan. Would you ask for amnesty with a house loan or car loan? Of course not. If the students dont pay them off quickly then they might have long term effects due to interest. They may lose their amnesty and then their debt will be higher tahn ever before.]]>

Students can receive a loan and have it forgiven but then they go and spend their money on nuisance things that don't correlate to their higher education. Most student loans are from taxpayers, so essentially people who don't the student could be paying for their education instead of them or their parents and family. This program sets the precedent and it's possible that students will have more debt without this program. In the last 30 years, the cost of attending a four year college has increased by 357% and this will most likely be rising or won't go down any time soon. This student program does have downsides but, it may be an investment to get students through college and prepare them for the real world.]]>

One argument states that students will only accumulate more college debt if their past debts were forgiven with a false sense of security. It's more than likely that with extra money, college students will spend their money on frivolous items, instead of on college tuition bills. The greatest problem with the student debt amnesty program is that U.S. taxpayers will be paying for the tuition of college students, instead of the students and their families. This could seem as an unfair bargain to many Americans--many of which who had lived in a generation in which they had to pay their own college debts without any financial aid. U.S. taxpayers would have to be liable to pay the increasingly expensive college tuitions of students, a 357% increase in the last 30 years. Taxes would have to rise accordingly, and American consumers would be up in arms.]]>

The percent of the cost of the four year college has grown by 357 percent and is a trend for the students but if they get it paid off then they will not have to worry abouyt ppaying it off later in the future.

However, about $1 trillion of the $1.2 trillion in student debt is paid by the taxpayers because it is from federal student loans. So, in reality the argument that more debt will be accumulated by the students to be granted amnesty, is unrealistic because most of their debt isn't even paid by them, it's paid by the government. In addition, the cost of a public four-year college has grown radily over the past 30 years so it is harder for students to even consider going to college for fear of having debts to repay. Through the amnesty program the students will be able to go to college with opportunities of &quot;working&quot; it off through a good GPA.]]>

If the debt is forgiven as suggested by the program, it will set a precedent for incoming students, leading them to believe that their debt will be forgiven as well. This will cause them to spend even more money because they think they won't be held accountable for it. There is also a concern that the money that would have been used for tuition will then be used towards the purchase of frivolous items. Finally, there is the obvious concern of who will be paying for these forgiven loans. Currently, about $1 trillion of $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans, which means that US taxpayers are paying for students' debt. These taxpayers would be hit the hardest if the loans were forgiven, because taxes will have to continue to raise if this program is to remain sustainable.]]>

Within the last 20 years, the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown outrageously by 357 percent; this means that students will receive debt amnesty and won't have to pay for college loans. Another controversial argument is that when loan debts are forgiven, where do you think the students' tuition money is going to go? The answer is towards unnecessary, frivolous items. This student debt crisis won't be solved with a wave of a wand; anout $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans; this means US tax payers are paying for students' debt instead of paying students and families. The biggest problem of all happens to be that when debt forgiveness takes it's toll, this sets precedent that similar loans in the future will also be forgiven. For example, forgiven college debt promotes accumulating more college debt.]]>

Setting a president is a problem because if a student acumulates a large amount of debt, and then that debt is forgiven, that student might accuire large amounts of debt later in life assuming that they will be similaraly forgiven. $1 trillion of the $1.2 trillion in student debts is owed to the government. By dropping those debts US taxpayers end up paying for other peoples chidren to go to college, rather that students parrents. There is some concern that, if students arnt paying tuition, they might be spending their money on frivolous items, things like, gambling, or partying. If students are given amnisty for coledge loans it could have many effects, such as; setting a president, using taxpayer money, and incoraging irisponsible spending.]]>

If the debts are forgiven, some students will spend money on frivolous items, not on tuition. About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans. This means that US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than students and familiys anyway. Over the last 30 years, the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent. This means that students add more debt to pay for college and sets a continuing trend--get debt amnesty and you won't have to pay college loans.]]>

To address the first issue, the poblem of students spending money on unecassary items, Even if debts are pardoned, there are still other college fees and costs that the money could go towards. Some of these include housing, car payments, getting food on the table, and others. Many college students do not have much money, one of the major reasons for the large amount of student debt, This causes them to make do without many of the necessary items, such as food and better clothing. Colleges could still make money off of other costs, they could also look into fundraising and donations. Also US taxpayers are only paying a very small percentage of what they make, while students are charged with bigger percentages with only a small amount of income, if any. Pardoning the debt can help taxpayers and students alike.]]>

This could lead to students becoming less responsible with their college funds and spending frivolously simply because they can. They also argue that much of that debt forgiveness would be coming out of the American taxpayer's pocket, due to the high percentage of student debt that is in federal loans. Opponents see a continuing trend of higher tuition leading to higher debt leading to more debt forgiveness, a cycle spiraling continuously downward. However, a simple solution would be to only forgive debt for high-performing students, encouraging good performance from the students. As long as colleges set limits on whose debt is forgiven, how much, and how often, this downward spiral proposed by the naysayers can be avoided.]]>

They say that debt forgiveness promotes accumulating more debt, and that when they receive amnesty, it will also promote frivolity and the students will spend money on things other than their tuition. These would be valid, and very persuasive, points if it were true that students are the ones who pay off most of their debt. However, out of the current student debt of $1.2 trillion, $1 trillion of it is in federal student loans. That means that U.S. taxpayer dollars are paying for the majority of debt students accumulate. Also, if the students are required to pay off their debts, they will only dig themselves deeper into debt. In the last 30 years, the average cost of tuition for a public 4-year institution has grown by 357 percent, this means that the students accumalative debt will only compound if they are forced to pay it. They are then left with a continuing trend of debt that lasts much longer than college and affects their whole lives. If, however, they are given amnesty on their debts, they remain to live debt free and accomplish the great goal of the American dream.]]>

The economy is not a system that is all take and no give. This teaches the students that things in life come free without hard work which is not true. Plus those debts need to be paid off so that there can be more money to go around for those who need loans too. The change that needs to be made is to reduse the debt or stop the debt. Still everyone should pay their debt. There are ways around these student debt problems, but there needs to be a different approach.]]>

However, with unaltered college rates and the current culture of college spending, some speculate that debt forgiveness sets precident that similiar loans in the future will also be forgiven. In other words, by promoting this solution, students will accumulate more debt with the assurance that most of it will be forgiven. Arguably, it incites frivolous spending on things other than tuition and a lack of accounntability. In constrast, considering the seriousness of debt and the financial and phycological stress it puts on individuals, they will most likely choose to spend just as they would if their debt was unforgiven. Statistically, around $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal loans. This means US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than students and families. This fact is unacceptable in terms of accountability and reveals the unrealistic cost of college.This must be addressed. With the debt so immense, though, we see that the debt of students cannot be paid off even distributed among all taxpayers. The cost of college should be reduced per individual to become realistic in order to remove unpayable debt from taxpayers, some of whom are not responsible. Finally, in the last thirty years, cost of a public four-year college have increased by 357 percent. With such a daunting rate and speculation that this trend will continue, the only solution is to get debt amnesty.]]>

Of course debt is always an issue to some, it is not anybody's fault, but the student's. Scholarships and grants will accomodate tuition toward students, IF the student does well before and during the college experience. Perhaps students should be more aware of the impact of financial needs and take opportunities given to them. They need to get better grades and participate in the community. It shouldn't be an economical issue if a student wants to go to college, but how they should get there should be thought out and planned financially. Rant over,]]>

Since $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans, US taxpayers are actually paying for students' debt rather than the students &amp; families themselves. Amnesty is looked upon as a gateway from college debt. Without college debt, students seize a chance of freedom, and by doing so, it sparks a temptation of being able to spend money on things that are irrelevant with thier tuition. Amnesty definitely has the potential to influence other similar debt problems as well.]]>

The opponents didnt clarify what they meant because they didnt have a legitimate answer to why we shouldnt give students with a high GPA amnesty, and they wouldnt just come out and say we dont want to give up all that cash. As a matter of fact doing this financial pardon on behalf of college students would help the economy exponentially over the next 10 years or so. This economic growth would be fueled by more people going to college and a higher success rate of those in college which will lead to more skilled workers which down the road leads to economic growth.]]>

If people don't learn to manage their finances early on then they never will. By just saying that they no longer have debt, we'd be encouraging them to accumulate more debt throughout their lives, teaching them that it's okay and that it will be forgiven in the end. Not only would forgiving student debt hurt the students and their families, but it would also hurt taxpayers, by making them responsible for the more than $1 trillion in federal student aid. And if we follow the trend of rising tuition, that just means that if we keep forgiving student loans that US taxpayers will be spending more and more each year on bailing out our graduates.]]>

This act will only push the debt to another party. Instead of the students paying back their own debt.. the debt would be pushed on to the tax payers which include the students and the public. The student crisis isnt about who should pay off all of these student debts but the problem is why is college so over priced? We as a country should help bring down the cost of going to a public college for 4 years instead of pushing the debt on to others. If we bring down the cost of public college there wouldnt be such a high level of student loans.]]>

For example, critics of debt forgiveness assert that many forgiven students will spend their money on trivial and unnecessary items rather than tuition. Not to mention, allowing debt forgiveness may give students now and in the future a false understanding that any debt will be forgiven and cause them to accumulate even more college debt. These two problems outline the major problem of the direct effects of the debt forgiveness program, and are especially reasonable given the age of college students and their general desire to be careless or impractical in some of their decisions. Of course, this is not the case for all college students, but it is an observed trend among them.]]>

Another concern is that instead of paying tuition students will spend money on frivolous items. However it may seem students can not take advantge of a system they themselves, and their parents pay into. About $1 trillion of $1.2 trillion dollars are being payed for by US. If students invest the money in their education, they should reap the benefits. When a student is sent off to college they are for the most part mature enough to manage their money. If a student is not paying for tuition they should be trusted enough to use their money in the most productive way for them.]]>

This is called debt forgiveness, which, though at first may seem like a great thing but can actually cause more problems down the road and does not really change anything. If debts are forgiven and students do not have to pay what they owe, they could easily just blow all the money that could be going towards their education and instead spend it on unimportant items and therfore never learn the true value of what their education costed them. This also causes problems for our government because they are paying for our education instead of the students and their families themselves. This is unnecessary and students should have to pay their own way and education to get where they want to be.]]>

Approximantly 1 trillion of the current 1.2 trillion in student debt is now being paid off by the US tax payers, instead of the taxes going toward students and their families. if the loan debts are forgiven, some students end up spending that money on frivolous items, not on their tuition. therefore, it accumulates more college debt for others to hope that it will be forgiven and paid off.]]>

Economists and jobs analysts consistently observe that higher education is &quot;still the best investment&quot; a young person can make in his or her future. The demand among expanding companies is for more job candidates with college degrees, so naturally, more people are turning to higher education to get an edge in a tough job market. For the sake of our economy, we need to make a college affordable to more young people trying to enter the work force, and to do this, we need to address the problem of college debt. Our local college's proposal to forgive the debt of currently enrolled students who have grade-point averages of over 2.5 is an effective strategy for solving this student debt problem.]]>

Also because they don't have the thought of them paying off later, they may be more tempted to either switch schools a lot or slack off of doing work. The students not paying back will help their debt problems but it will only make the nations debt problem worse and it would raise the prices of other things. Students who have to pay back their loans would know what the responsibility feels like and it would help them in the future when they have more bills, loans, and just other things to pay off or support. Also it may help them take what their learning more serious, and they'll be motivated. The students getting loans and then paying back makes like a cycle that shouldn't be broken.]]>

The first potentian problem is students are given amnesty on student loans is the promotion for gaining more college debt. When students are given amnesty on their loans, many individuals will be prone to gain more debt since the consequences are not enforced. Also, many economists believe that the money that once went to student loans will now be used for other things other than tuition. Finally, students have racked up $1.2 trillion in student debt in federal loans, so this means that taxpayer are paying for solely student instead of their families also.

This debt is being paid for directly out of the pockets of many Americans through their taxes. As long as this number continues to rise, citizens of the US will continually have to pay for the expenses of students attending college. But this won't stop students from going to college, in fact, this new debt forgiveness program will only promote them to recklessly avoid paying for their own tuition and depend on the money of Americans tax dollars. If this program is inhibited, then the national debt will only rise as students avoid paying for their schooling.]]>

Even though it would help students get through college and acquire a job later on, it would set a negative continuing trend. As the cost of attending college goes up, so does the amount of student loans. As the amount of student loans go up, so does the amount of money American citizens have to pay in taxes. Also, if students receive debt amnesty, they will expect to receive that in the future. If they don't, protests may arise. Lastly, students who don't have college loans to pay off would have a tendency to spend money on sillier items such as drugs or alcohol. Debt amnesty may sound good, but the problems it would create would far outweigh the benefits.]]>

College is at time where students begin to experience the real world and everything that acompanies being an adult. If student debt was forgiven, it has the potential to set a precendent that future debts would be forgiven and also the neglect of said debt. Another issue that is argued with the topic of forgiven debt is that the students and families are not paying all the loans. Recent studies show that about $1 trillion in the curret $1.2 trillion is in federal student loans. This means that it is the tax payers of the US that are paying the student debt rather than the families and students. With the forgiveness also comes negelect of debts, as mentioned above. If amnesty is granted, that gives off the idea to other students that they can take out all the loans they need and not worry about the consequences of the debt and proceed to spend their money on meaningless items. While student debt is hard, giving amnesty would do more harm than good in the long run when it comes to preparing the students for the future.]]>

If debts are forgiven colleges will begin to lose money for operating expenses. Pay for teachers may have to be reduces, funding for sports may have to be cut, costs for the building, such as heating and air conditioning, will become harder to pay for, and many more things. Perhaps a better option would be to reduce the debt of the students rather than remove it altogether. This way students would not have as much debt, the money from tax payers would not have to be used as much for loans, and the colleges would still be receiving money from students to continue operations.]]>

One issue is that the debt from forgiving these loans will continue to add up. This is simpily because the money does not disapear. This money will, in return, be payed off by US taxpayers and in the future will be those college graduates. Meaning they will be paying extra taxes from unpayed loans rather than to the students themselves. Student loans teach a college student and graduate to save and be careful with money. If loan debts were forgiven then students would lose that important lesson of living in simplicity. They would perhaps spend that money elsewhere on less important things rather than learning the value of money.]]>

One potential problem that the opponents argue is that similar loans in the future will also be forgiven, which gives initiative for college debt to be gathered further. Also if these debts were to be forgiven, students will no longer see the need to spend money on tuition and possibly ignore it altogether. Another argument explained by the oppnents is that about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans, as a result the US taxpayers are paying for college debt instead of the students and their families. In the last 30 years the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357%, this means that the more the debt is forgiven and the higher price of college, the more likely a trend is to continue in which students will not pay their college loans.]]>

They say that if we let them have it easier now, later on other future loans will also be given. What I dont understand, is why that is a bad thing. Not only will we be making it easier on college students now, but maybe we will make it easier for other people later on also. Then they say that other US tax pays are paying for student debt, but really so are the rest of us. It is not unfair, if every other person is doing the exact same thing. Lastly, they say that if they goes through and we dont have to pay for college loans, other people wont have as much to earn, like the teachers. I think that they should be grateful for teaching the next generation and get what they get. They are still going to be paid no matter what.]]>

While the students might get there debt forgiven they will probly go and spend the extra money are some non important materials that dont matter. With this money they will not spend any on the tution so it might cause a larger dilema. There is around 1.2 trillion dollars worth of student debts and about one trillion which is from the federal student loans. This means the US taxpayers are giving most of there money to the students debt rather ,having that money go somewhere else like the homes of students and familes. In the last thirty years the tution of a public four-year college has gone up by at least threehundred and fifty-seven percent. With the college costing more adn more this will be hard to get out of the trend setting way of debt and the debt amnest wont have to pay for the college loans.]]>

Some problems include setting precedent that similar loans in the future will also be forgivien, and that forgiven college debt promotes accumulating more college debt. This just means that forgiveness will still add on to college debt. Also, if loan debts are forgiven, then some students may spend money on unimportant or nonvaluable items and not tuition. The students won't feel worried about having to pay off their debt. As for debt, about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal loans, which means that US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than students and families paying. In the last thirty years, the cost of a public four-year tuition has grown rapidly by 357%. This means that students have added more debt to pay for college.

These debts that are pardoned may not be effective considering that tuition for a public four-year college has increased by 357% in the last three decades! This money that has been spent needs to be payed off at some point, or the whole school system would collaspe due to lack of funds.

If students come to rely on the knowledge that their debt will be forgiven , they will spend more frivously on less necessary items. Around $1 trillion of the $1.2 trillion of the current student debt is in federal loans, so US taxpayers are paying a student's debt, rather than leaving the burden to students and their families. Over the last 3 decades, cost of college tuition in public for year colleges has increased by 357%. Debt will be a continuing trend, the program may work for one year, but it will continue to cost more and more as tuition continues to rise. Who is going to pay a student's debt then ?]]>

The money used to pay for college didn't just magically apear it came from somewhere. By forgiving debt we will be taking money from random, innocent people and using it to pay for someone else's college. What if that saved up money that the bank loaned out was college fund for an upcoming college student? Now these students will be swimming in debt because their money was loaned out and not given back.]]>

Instead of getting supplies and paying for their tuition, they will spend it on themselves. This will increase the taxes for taxpayers all because the students who decided to not pay for their student loans were forgiven. However, the loan forgiveness is helpful. If the students use this for school supplies and even for their tuition, it will help the families and student financially. Let's just say this student is trying to succeed academically, but his financial situation is very poor.

That means there would be money lost somewhere in the transition. If the college pays for the debt, that means that college would maybe get more expensive. If the bank looses the money, that means that they will be loosing money. If the bank is loosing money, that means taxpayers might have to pay a higher percantage of tax.

Loaning money will hinder the efforts of higher education efforts. This entails potential effects such as accumulation of more debt, spending more on items outside of tuition, and the misuse of these grants. If loan debts are forgiven, students will spend their income on &quot;frivolous&quot; items, therefore not taking full responsibility for their education. 1/1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans, which means that taxpayers are absorbing debt rather than helping the students themslves.]]>

Many students go into college and are shocked by overwhelmng debt once they leave. The $1 trillion of the student debt representing student loans is a perfect example. If colleges were to offer amnesty programs, many students would continue to pile up their debts that are being forgiven, which means there is more and more money that is not being repaid. It could turn into a scam to go to college for less money than is technically owed, which may have adverse affects on the school and the economy.]]>

The probability that a student would get a more intense degree ONLY because they dont have to pay for it is unlikely. Those who wish to further their education should have the ability too, and we taxpayers should be supportive of that in order to support a sustainable economy.

If loan debts are forgiven, some students will spend their money on more frivolous items instead of their tuition. If we forgive students of their loans, this means that US taxpayers will be paying for their tuition instead of the students and their families. This isn't fair to the people who don't have kids going to college, and never went to college themselves. If we decide to fogive college students debt forgiveness, then is could start a new trend where everyone wants their debts forgiven. Over the last thirty years the cost of college has increased by 357 percent. that menats the the student will add more debt to the college and then it would continue down hill from there.]]>

One situation of paying for the debt is that taxpayers money is being used, not the students money, not even the parents money; hard earned tax payers money. People need to access if they'll be able to afford the schooling or if they can find an affordably alternative for paying for extra schooling.

If loan debts forgiven, some of the students will spend their money on stuff they really dont need and not on their tuition. About $1 trillion out of $1.2 trillion is put into student loans which means that the tax payers are paying for students' debt rather than families or students who need the support. The last 30 years the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown by 357 percent. Which says that a student adds more debt to pay for college. Tuition shouldn't cost more than a kid. It should be at a slow steady pace of paying just like you are paying for your house not three houses. Students in college should pay for their books and that should be able to cover part of their tuition.]]>

If the loan debts are forgiven, some students will spend money on frivolous items, that is not on the tuition. It is said that about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans. That means US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than students &amp; families. In the last 30 years the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent. It means that students add more debt to pay college, and sets continuing trend. Some students get debt amnesty and won't have to pay college loans. With debt forgiveness all loans that students get will be pardon and will not be paid once the student is finished their college learning experience.]]>

If debt forgiveness came into play, it would only put students and the economy further in the hole. Debt forgiveness sets a precedent that similiar loans in the future will always be forgiven. This would lead some students to believe that their debts will always be paid off by somebody else. Not only this, but forgiving college debt promotes accumluating even more college debt and perhaps the money would be spent on frivolous items rather than actual schooling. As for the economy aspect, about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans. This means US taxpayers are paying for students' debt and the actual students and families are not. Lastly, over the course of the last thirty years, the cost of a public four-year college has grown rapidly by 357 percent. This means that students actually add more debt to pay for college. Students, therefore, would receive debt amnesty and would not have to pay college loans.]]>

About $1 trillion of the $1.2 trillion debt is in federal student loans. So that means that everyday tax payers are paying off the student debt more then the students and their parents. Another potential problem with paying off the debt is that it sets a precedent to the students that if their debt was paied off once why can't it be paied off again. Also if these loan debts are forgiven some students will stop caring for their education and not spend their extra money on tuition but on other more parishable items.]]>

By making it clear that the removal of the debt is a one time offer, the problem of people's expectations of future forgiveness is alleviated. In addition, some may say that students will spend money on frivolities, but the goal isn't to make sure that students are spending wisely. It's making sure that they can enjoy a decent standard of living after they have graduated, something that is made very difficult by a mountain of student debt and living expenses. That fact that colleges tuition cost so much more now is all the more reason to forgive the debt, as students continuing through school need help with their $60,000 tuition. There is no way I am arguing against the forgiveness of student debt as a junior in high school.]]>

By forgiving college loans, it could lead students to think that similar loans in the future could also be forgiven. Forgiving their debt promotes gaining more debt and digging themselves into an even deeper hole. The forgiving of loan debts could lead students to pursue alterior motives, meaning that they would spend their money on things other than their college tuition. Currently, $1 trillion of the $1.2 trillion of student debt is federal, meaning that taxpayers pay for college students' debt, rather than the students and their families. The cost of four-year college has increased by 357 percent in the last 30 years. If the students add more debt to pay for college and the trend continues, the amnesty won't have to pay college loans.]]>

That means that the debt will transfer from an average of $20,000 per student into a collective addition of nearly $1 trillion to the national debt ceiling. Also, opponents of this proposition argue that once this debt is forgiven, many students will just become more in debt hoping it will be forgiven, or spend the freed income from forgiven debt on frivolous items. Some also believe that if loans are forgiven once, it will begin a continuous trend of amnesty for loans. Since the cost of public four year college tuition has increased over three times the amount that it was 30 years ago, college debt in this country has the potential to increase just as exponentially as it has the last 30 years if we continue to let it grow. We need to start anew, cut out the profit-skimming middleman of public four year universities and create a public college system similar to our highschool system. This may cause more expense to the U.S. initially, but if a larger amount of students are given the chance to have successful, high-paying jobs, in the decades to come tax revenue will increase greatly. This will balance the costs of setting up this new system, and also cover the existing debt. Students will not spend frivilously because the amnesty will not increase their existing income, and the new system will start a trend of success rather than the existing trend of americans paying for a college that is beyond their budgets.]]>

Many people are frivolous with their money as is, and given the opportunity to have more the government could not be sure that the pardoned debt money would go towards something useful. Another effect is, US taxpayers are already paying for the college debt so the student and family are not really effected. All of the taxpayers money goes towards debt, so they are actually paying off student loans. Also, forgiving the college debt will just lead to students asking for more loans and they will eventually accumulate more debt. The students will begin to think that they can get all of thier debts pardoned and will ask for more loans and gain more debt. Finally, the cost of college tuition is rising so the debt rate will increase with it. The rising tution is a constant trend so students will always being asking for more money and increasing their debt even if some of it is pardoned. The student debt amnesty program is good in theory, however people will still accumulate debt in college.]]>

Debt that has been forgiven can cause a more uncautious livestyle towards later student loans. If a person accumulates debt and then gets that debt forgiven by this program, later on that person could be less cautious about accumulating debt that may not be forgiven. Even if this doesnt affect the students future debt accumulation, it still shifts the weight of the debt on to the shoulders of the American taxpayers. With already 1 trillion dollars in students loans on the taxpayers this could be bad for the economy.]]>

Forgiving the debts might not help because some of the students will spend money on things that are not even related to college, and talking about students that cant afford to pay for their colleges, US taxpayers are paying for students colleges more than their own parents. In last 30 years the cost of the four-year college tuition increased by 357 percent, that means that if students are going to keep adding debt to pay for college they won't have to pay for college loans. Forgiving the debts it might help students a little bit but soon they will forget that education is not for free and many students will drop out easily, because they didnt pay for it.]]>

On occasion colledge is thought to be a place not of higher learning but of higher social enjoyment and a mating ground for those who desire pleasure of life these types of people are liable to when given any form of pocket cash go out and purchase objects for their amusement and enjoyment that have nothing to do with either their wellbeing or their education. Those who are irresponsible are also creating a huge burden on the government in taxes the government and through the government the tax payers would then be responsible for the mass debts of the student populace. The overall trend is that the tuition is growing with the economy and that giving them amnesty in debt then you will simply be inflating the progress ever more quickly. In conclusion humanity for the most part is rather unreliable in colledge and a more rigourous screening process should eliminate all of the students who would in the end use their opportunity in naught or are simply unfit or unmotivated to attend. This being said we shoud also work to eliminate the social and cultural stigmatism with choosing not to go to colledge but go directly into the work force.]]>
