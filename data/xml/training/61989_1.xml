The Aztec's diet consists of Tomatoes, avacados, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples, chocolate, pumpkins, and peanuts. The Aztects also used onions, garlic, and chilis to make the food more flavorful. They added chili to almost everything. Farmers don't keep animals, but they did go hunting and farming. The meats they ate includes fish, duck, turkey, deer, parrots, owls, eagles, lizards, and frogs. Birds' egg and insects' egg are also included and considered a great treat. Fresh plums or cherries might be included in a meal. Desserts are rare. Emperors would drink hot chocolate with cacao beans, vanilla, spices, and chili pods, which made the drink hot and spicy.

Most meals include a tortilla - a type of pancake made from maize flour - that can be wrapped around a range of fillings. The Aztecs have plenty of fresh ingredients...&quot; This textual evidence supports the claim because in this paragraph, Aztec food is known to be quite hearty, and is usually made of fresh ingredients. Source 2, Producing Food: &quot;...Their most important food was corn. Tomatoes, avocados, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples, chocolate, pumpkins, and peanuts were also important in their diet...&quot; This textual evidence supports the claim because the Aztecs ate a variety of food such as tomatoes, pumpkins, etc. Source 3, Saving the Chinampas, Paragraph 5: &quot;In the traditional method, the farmer first scoops mud from the bottom of the canal. Removing the layer of mud from the bottom of the canal which in turn helps the fish and plants. The farmer spreads the mud out on the ground in four-inch layer. After the mud dries, he cuts it into cubes and plants seeds of one crop (crop can be varied) into each cube by hand. He then waits for the seeds to sprout. In the meantime, he prepares the garden soil with natural fertilizers. When the seeds begin to grow, he plants them in the ground he has prepared. In 25 days, he could have [ crop name ]! The farmer then behins the process all over again. It is possible to grow from 5-7 rounds of crops each year. Some say that just as these chinampas fed the hundreds of thousands of dpresidents of the great Aztec city of Tenochtitlan for hundreds of years, they could provide food for the entire population of Mexico City (all 25 million of them) for 30 years!&quot; This textual evidence supports the claim because farmers could use the method in order to grow enough crops for their fill.]]>

This reason support the claime that Aztecs ate very well because it explains that the foods they ate were all very natural and not procsesed food which are a lot healthier. This also supports the claim becuase it says that they also ate yummy foods not just healthy foods which is good because then you wouldnt mind going on he diet if you occasonally get some really yummy foods. The Aztecs also ate well because they farmed most of thier food with thier tools, their water, and thier supplies. This reason supports the claime because it shows that all the foods were made by them so they are clean not poisinous and they rely on there own hard work to get what they need to survive.

To prove that just start by looking at Source 2. It says in the first paragraph that the Aztec's most important food was corn, somthing that didnt exist in Europe at the time. Then they would have tomatoes, avocadoes, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples and even chocolate. Then it says the foods were discovered by the spanish and soon spread to the European diet. Thus we can suggest that the qouality of the food was so good that the europeans adopeted it. Another Example can be found in source 1, the Aztec food was hearty beacause of the tortilla which could be arranged witha variety of flavors, thus that everyone could make their own flavor and eat well. Our last example can easily be found in source 1. It clearly says here that the Aztecs managed a variety of foods by hunting them daily thus they were fresh. Nowadays not every peice of food is fresh so think of the high quality it would have taken.]]>

Some examples of these foods are tomatoes, avaocados, chilies, peppers, sweet potatos, pinapples, choclate, pumpkins, and peanuts. Chinampas were built by digging channels through the marshes heaping up mud to create small islands. Wooden posts were put at each end of the island to keep the mud from washing away. Alos, willow trees were planted to keep the ground to keep the soil in place. The most important crop was corn and the most useful tool was called a coa. A coa was a digging stick with a broad wooden blade and a long handle. Astec farmers used this tool for digging and hoeing, but it was still really hard. Something that made farming easier was the light soil because it made it easier to dig.]]>

Their most impotent food was corn. Tomatoes, avocados, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples, chocolate, pumpkins,and peanuts were also important in their diet. These fruits and vegetables were all new to the invading Spaniards, but they soon learned to like them. Spanish ships carried many of these foods back to Spain, and they soon became part of the European diet. In source #3 the Aztecs could have a head of lettuce, in 25 days! The farmers begin the process all over again. It is possible to grow from 5-7 rounds of crops every year.

In Source #1, it says that the Aztecs had a very varied diet, and mainly rely on a bunch of different foods to supply their nutritional needs. This means that the Aztec were particularly healthy, and may not have prospered if it weren't for their healthy diet.]]>

Turning corn into flower was also very hard because it took many hours. They also had chocolate drinks. They believed that it was the drink of the gods and commoners could not drink it. Source #2.]]>

They had plenty of vegetables and fruit, so the food was probably very important to their daily living to be strong and healthy. They worked hard for their food. If they wanted any food, especially good food you had to plow by hand with a coa, a wooden tool with a long handle. They did not eat any meat. People that are vegetarian are mostly healthy finding other ways of protein.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[One example of how the Aztecs ate well is in the Producing Food section in source #2. It states, &quot;The Aztecs ate very well. Tomatoes, avocados, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples, chocolate, pumpkins, and peanuts were also important in their diet.&quot; This quote supports the idea of a good diet because they grew all these crops themselves so they know what they are eating. If someone else grew them, the Aztecs wouldn't know if they added something to it. Another example is also in source #2 but now in the Building Chinampas section. This says, &quot; To keep the soil on the chinampas fertile, the farmers spead fresh mud from the lake over their gardens.... Thanks to this treatment, the soil on the chinampas was so rich that farmers could grow up to seven crops each year.&quot; This example shows how the Aztecs wanted to keep their crops fresh and healthy to eat. By spreading mud from the lake, they kept the soil nice and fertile so they could keep growing crops year after year. The last example in source #2 is in the Preparing Food section. This section states, &quot; The Aztecs ate mostly fresh food, which they brought in the markets every day. They also preserved food to keep it from spoiling.&quot; This shows by keeping the food preserved, it will maintain it's freshness and not spoil. They probably use their own spices to keep their food preserved, too. After all these examples I think it is pretty clear that the Aztecs did eat a good diet over their lifetime.]]>

Some of their foods that they ate were Tomatoes, Avocados, chilles, Peppers, Sweet potatoes, Pineapples, Chocalate, Pumpkins, and Peanuts. Three that i will be explaining are Peanuts, Avocadoes, and Pumpkins. Before i explain these types of foods alll of these foods were new to the Spaniards. Anyways, like i was saying Peanuts are the most important food for the diet ofthe aztecs. From my oppion i believe that the aztecs did not like their food. From the text i know that the Spaniards liked the aztecs food and i have cite textual evidence to support my answer. In source 2, paragraph 2, it says, &quot;These fruits and vegatables were all new to the invanding Spaniards, but they soon learned to like them. Also, after the Spaniards liked the food they started to have the Spanish ships carry a lot of these foods back to spain and sooner or later it became part of the European diet.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[One example that the Aztecs ate very well was in Source #1 in the paragraph titled, &quot;Varied Veggies.&quot; It stated that, &quot;If you like veggies, you are in for a treat. During your trip you will probably get the chance to eat peppers, tomatoes, leeks, squashes, watercress, and artichokes, to name just a few! The Aztecs also use onions, garlic, chilis, and different herbs to make their food taste more flavorful. Desserts are rare, but you may be served fresh plums or cherries with your meal.&quot; This proves they enjoyed a good diet because this portrays how they had a variety of healthy foods to choose from. Another example from Source #2 was, &quot;The Aztecs ate very well. Their most important food was corn. Tomatoes, avocados, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples, chocolate, pumpkins, and peanuts were also important in their diet. These fruits and vegetables were all new to the invading Spaniards, but they soon learned to like them. Spanish ships carried many of these foods back to Spain, and they soon became part of the European diet.&quot; This proves they enjoyed a good diet because it demonstrates that they once again had a variety of foods and they also influenced other places such as Spain to take on these eating habits. One more example was in Source #2 when it stated, &quot;the Aztecs ate mostly fresh food, which they bought in the markets every day. They also preserved food to keep it from spoiling. The Aztecs did not use ovens but cooked their food on open fires. Ordinary people usually drank water. but for important Aztecs there were other drinks. A favorite was choclatl, or drinking chocolate, made from the beans of the cacao tree. Octli, an alcoholic drink made from the sap of the maguey catus, was drunk by older Aztecs----only people over the age of thirty were allowed to drink alcohol.&quot; This proves that the Aztecs enjoyed a good diet because it signifies that not only are there a variety of foods but a variety of places where they come from. This shows some of their eating habits such as preserving foods and not having only foods but a variety of drinks too. All in all, the Aztecs ate very well and enjoyed a good diet with all the healthy choices and variety of cuisines including the variety of places these cuisines came from.]]>

''these fruits and vegtables were all new to the invading spainiards, but they soon learned to like them.''(source #2) This shows how now their most important food are all fruits and vegatbels.

The reason I believe that the Aztec ate very well is because in the source it says that &quot;Tomatoes, alvacados, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples, chocolate, pumpkins, and peanuts were also important in their diet.&quot; This proves that there diet contained mostly fruits and vegetables which is healthy and makes up a good diet. Source #3: Source 3 supports that the Aztecs ate very well because it says that &quot;These same chinampas fed hundeds of thousands of residents of the great Aztec city of Tenochtitlan for hundreds of years.&quot; This proves that the Chinampas provided enough food to feed many people enough food to live for a very long time.]]>

In this source it is stated that the Aztecs ate hearty, wholesome, and filling food. This means that they weren't putting 'junk food' into their bodies, they were making smart food choices. The Aztecs enjoyed eating wholesome food because it's what helped keep them alive. In source 2, it says that the Aztecs ate mostly fresh food. This proves that they were eating well because studies have shown that fresh food is better for you than &quot;not&quot; fresh food. For example, today in our society, an apple (fresh food) is better for you than twinkies (not fresh food). The fresh food also must have refreshed the Aztecs because the Aztec civilization was very hot, being so close to the equator.Eating well presents two major meanings, eating healthily and eating the right amount of food. In source 3, it's stated that the chinampas fed hundred of thousands of residents of the Aztec city for hundreds of years. This means that instead of letting hungry people starve, chinampas were able to feed hungry people. The Aztecs enjoyed this way of eating because if they didn't, they would have a different diet.]]>

There meals were filling and spicy according to source 1. They must have ate well knowing that there meals are filling. In source 2 paragraph 3 it states that, &quot;Thanks to this treatment, the soil on the chinampas was so rich that farmers could grow up to seven crops each year.&quot; This means that the farmers ate well considering on how manny crops they get a year. Thanks to the treatment the farmmers get plenty of crops a year making growing food easy. According to source 3 paragraph 5 it states that, &quot;In fact, some say that just as these same chinampas fed the hundreds of thousands of residents of the great Aztec city Tenochtitlan for hundreds of years.&quot; This proves that the Aztecs were well fed for hundreds of years. In conclusion these were some examples that support the claim that Aztecs ate well.]]>

Their diet consists of corn, pinapple, tomatoe, peppers, avocados, and others were eaten a lot in their daily lives. Even though these fruits and vegetables were new to living Spaniards, they soon learned to like these foods. Another way that the Aztecs ate very well was that they ate mostly fresh food. As stated in the paragraph 'Preparing Food', it states that the Aztecs ate mostly fresh foods, which they bought in the markets every day. They didn't want food to be spoiled, so they preserved the food. And the last way that the Aztecs ate healthy, was that they had nice drinks.]]>

I think that this is important and shows that enjoy a good diet because fresh food just tast's alot better and it tast's well, more fresh! Another example is from paragraph 2 and it says that they ate avocados, tomatoes and many more fruits and vegtibles that were really important to their every7 day diet. If they didn't eat these foods they would probably be eating alot of junk food and they would be more... Fat! The last example is from paragraph 1. In this paragraph it shows how hard they had to work on growing their fresh crops. In this paragraph it states that they had no plows, carts or animals to pull the plow's and wagon's. Instead the farmers had to do it all by themselves. I give them alot of credit because they had to work and they kept on trying and the never gave up and started eating junk food they kept on going and ate healthy food.]]>

A 2nd example is also in source#1 in Varied Vegetables it says ''During your trip you will probably get the chance to eat peppers, tomatoes, leeks, squashes, watercress, and artichokes.The Aztecs also use onions, garlic, chilis, and different herbs to make their food taste more flavorful.''This supports this because it talks about how they eat spicy and healthy vegetables like peppers and tomatoes.Last the 3rd example is from source #3 the fourth paragraph when it say's ''Farmers are trying to expand their market by reaching out to expensive restaurants in Mexico City.''So these are examples to support the'' Aztecs ate very well''.]]>

The second deatail that I know that explains how Aztecs ate very well is when it also states in source one how Maize is grow all over the Aztec Empire. It also says how Maize is the basic element of every meal, and how sometimes it is eaten in the form of corn on the cob, but usally is dried ,ground into flour , and made into tortillas. So if Maize is the basic element of every meal then it was probablly good for the Aztecs to eat, considering it was practically eaten at every meal. So my third deatail that suppors how Aztecs ate very well is when it states in source three is when it say that if you were to visit Mexico City today you would still be able to expierence the last living example of Aztec history. Another detail is that you could climb abord on a brightly painted flat bottomed boat and take a trip on the canals and flow through the 50 square miles of floating gardens known a chinampas. So as you can see this detail shows how the Astect's had 50 square miles of garden where they grew all of their food and plants such as vegestables like corn on the cob and friut like tamatos and where they grew their Maize with is the basic element of every meal for Aztecs. So these three details show how the Aztects ate very well.]]>

For example, the Aztecs ate corn witch is very important to them. This suports the idea that they enjoy a good diet because it is a important crop to grow for them and they turned corn into flower. Another example is, the Aztecs mostly ate fresh food. This supports the idea that they injoy a good diet because fresh food is usualy somthing healthy for anyone to eat. My 3rd example that support that the Aztecs injoy a good diet is that the Aztecs is that they grew alot of fruits and vegetables. This supports why the Aztecs enjoyed a good diet becuase if the Aztecs ate alot of fruits and vegetables, that means that the Aztecs ate alot of good and healthy food.]]>

The second example of the &quot;The Aztecs&quot; is that the aztec famers had no plows or carts and no working animals .So they had to grow their own food. I know this beacause in the text , it talks about how the aztecs had to work really hard on there food.The last example of the &quot;The Aztecs&quot; is that the most important food they had to crop was the corn. I know this because in the text it talks about how the farmers had to use the useful farming tools to dig sticks called coas.This support my answers because it helps you know how the aztec farmers had a good diet.

From source #1 it states that they expecially loved to eat vegetables like peppers, tomatoes, leeks, squashes, watercress, and artichokes. They also ate onions, garlic and chilies. Usually a Plum or cherry was a treat for after dinner. They would also like to eat fish, turkey, deer, parrots, owls, eagles, lizzards, and Bird/Insect Eggs. This was considered there &quot;HEALTHY DIET&quot;. This diet kept them staying healthy. According to source #2 they would also eat things like avocados, sweet potatoes, pineapples, chocolate, pumpkins and peanuts. These foods were the most important in there daily diets because they were passing it down from generation to generation from there ancestors back in Spain. There most important crop was corn, because it was the center of everything else including most of there meals. It was basically an ingredent for most foods. From source #3 fish were one of the most foods aten there. Fishermen would spend days and days in the ocean trying to catch all of the fish that they could. But there was a big problem. There water was becoming polluted by wastewater treament plants, meaning that inconclusion the fish can be harsh to eat. Meaning that it can get you sick and may have a virus or disease being carried around. That was one of the biggest issues because nobody wanted to get sick. I know this because in these sources there are little bits of information and if you put all of it together you can write a story about it. These statements support my answer because they prove that they cared about there everyday diets.]]>

Also it states that the kernals had to be scraped off the cobs and soaked overnight in water mixed with limestone, to loosen the outer skin. I know this because after they were boiled and all the kernal were scraped off they were now soft enough to be ground into flour crushing between grooved stone rollers ( a manos) and a small stone slab (a metate). Another way i know this is because They had three stones that were arranged in a triangle in the hearth and supported the cooking pots and pans. The last reason i know this because the stones also supported a flat stone griddle that they used back in the day when there were no pots, pans and stoves to be used. evidence from the text to support my answer is since farmers had no plows or carts, instead they relied on simple tools and hard work to grow their food. another piece of evidence to support my answer is the aztecs ate mostly fresh food. This shows me that people who lived back then almost got to do what they wanted and drink what what they want.]]>

I think that this is true because, in paragragh five, it is stated that &quot;The Aztecs ate mostly fresh food,&quot; I think that is an example of Aztec people eating well because, most fresh food is good, well-made food. Another example of Aztec people eating well is stated in paragragh three. This paragragh is labeled &quot;Growing Crops&quot;. I believe that this provides an example of Aztec people eating well because it clarifies that Aztec farmers grow the majority of New Mexico's crops, proving that not many of them are imported from far away countries. A third example of Aztec people eating well is stated in paragragh five. This paragragh clearly states &quot;Turning corn into flour was women's work and took many hours.&quot; I believe that this is an example of Aztec people eating well because it states that time is put into making Aztec food, and that it is made by hand, not by machines. I believe that these are three main examples of how Aztec people enjoyed good diets and ate very well.]]>

They also liked to hunt and eat parrots, owls, eagles, lizards, and frogs. Birds and insects eggs were a little treat for them. Some other treats/desserts are fresh plums or cherries that go with there meal. They also make there own tortillas and on the side of that comes with stuffed beans and vegetables. But on special occasions meat or fish may be added to the filling. And the tortillas may be steamed or baked but if you had them baked they would be extra crunchy and I think mor healthier.

All of these foods were fairly healthy, yet have tasty flavors. In Preparing Food, it states that the Aztecs who were 30 or older would enjoy an alcoholic drink. Like people now a days, alcohal can nbe thought of as a treat. Also, Turning Corn to Flour, says that women would make flour out of corn. Since flour can be used in many recipies, you can see that the Aztecs probably ate foods other than meat, veggies, and fruits.]]>

My last example is from source one it says &quot;Most meals include a tortilla-a type of pancake made from maize flour-that can be wrapped around a range of fillings.&quot; This passage clearly states that the Aztecs like the majority of modern day humans have lots of food and ways to put the food together.]]>

Second they spread the mud out on the ground in a four inch layer. After the mud dries, he or she cuts it into cubes and plants seeds of one crop into each cube then he or she waits for the seed ro sprout, then he or she puts it in the floor. Thats how the Aztecs system worked. Now im going to tell you what the Aztecs diet consisted of. Their diet was tortilla a type of pancake made from maize flour.]]>

The also prezerved food to keep it from spoiling. The Aztecs did not use ovens they used open fires.&quot; My next example can be found in source three &quot; After the mud dries he cuts it into cubes and plants seeds of one crop (for example, lettuce) into each cube by hand. He then waits for the seeds to sprout. In the meantime,he prepares the garden soil with natural fertilizers. When the seed begins to grow, he plants them in the ground he has prepared. In 25 days, he could have a head of lettace! The farmer then begins the process all over again.&quot; My third and final example can be found in source one &quot; In spite of the diffucult weather, the Aztecs grow a wide rage of produce. Farmers grow maize, beans, vegetables, ffruit and even flowers. All faarming is done by hand using woodeeen tools.&quot; These three exxamples tell me that teh Aztecs always had fresh food that were hand grown.]]>

From source one, I found the information that, &quot;Aztec food is hearty, wholesome, and filling&quot;, which shows the Aztecs had a good diet because if the food is hearty, wholesome, and filling, it tastes good and is good for you. Also from source one, I found the information that the, &quot;Aztec emperors like to end each day with a drink of hot chocolate&quot;, which is a good tasting, spicy drink. I can tell it is a delicacy because only the emperors drank it. Also on the topic of drink, in source two, I found the information that, &quot;Octli, an alcoholic drink made from the sap of the maguey cactus, was drunk by older Aztecs -- only people over the age of thirty were allowed to drink alcohol&quot;, which shows they ate well because alcohol is usually a delicacy. So, based on evidence from two sources, the Aztecs ate well.]]>

I think this answer supports the claim because, all of source 1 was about the food they ate. In source #2, they said that the Aztecs ate corn, tomatoes, avocados, chocolate, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples, pumpkins, and peanuts. I think this answer supports the claim because the whole first paragraph of source 2 was about the food that they ate. In source #3, they said that if we were to visit Mexico City today, we would be able to experience the Aztec history. We would be able to ride a boat through the 50 square miles of ancient Aztec floating gardens. It also said that the chinampas could grow between 5-7 rounds of crops each year, and that they could provide food for the entire population of Mexico City for 30 years. I think that this answer supports the claim because if the Aztecs would need 50 square miles of chinampas, thay must have eaten alot.]]>

They never starved because the farmers always had crops going and usually harvested six or seven times a year! The Aztecs had a good selection of food too. In most ancient empires the main dish was rat. But not in the Aztec Empire they had corn, tomatoes, avocados, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples, chocolate, pumpkins, and peanuts, all those things people in America would eat normally. The crops turned out good too because the soil was rich and soft too soft but besides that those are two good combinations why farmers crops were succesful and citizens were never hungery.]]>

This shows that they can grow many different types of foods and lots of them so no one was ever starving and they all had enough to eat. In source 1 they said that they grow a wide range of produce such as mazie, beans, vegetables, fruit, and even flowers. (and more) This shows they have many different types of fruit vegetables ect. so they can create mand different dishes and meals and with corn they can make flour to bake with. and out of the flour they can also make tortillas. In source 1 they also say that Mazie is grown all over the Aztec empire. With them saying this and that this is the basic element foe every meal i would say it probably was quite healthy. This is most likely why they ate it at every meal. It probably kept them healthy and provented them from getting too overweighted.]]>

First, the Aztecs enjoyed eating tomatoes, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples, chocolate, pumpkins, and peanuts, all these foods were very important to their diet. These fruits and vegtables were all new to the invading Spaniards, but they soon learned to like them and have it be apart of thier diet. Second, important Aztecs were allowed to have other drinks, one of their favorites was choclatl, or drinking chocolate. They were also allowed to drink an alcoholic drink made from the sap of the maguey cactus, this drink was drunk by older Aztecs. Only people over the age of thirty were allowed to drink alcohol. Third, corn and tortialls were a big part of Aztecs lives. They would soak kernels overnight, then in the morning they were boiled and the skin was removed, they were soft enough to be ground into flour by crushing them between a stone roller and a stone slab, after all this work it would create a corn tortilla. To sum up, the Aztec ate very well and had good diets.]]>

Lastly, the Aztec emperors like to enjoy the end of every day with a drink of hot chcoclate. &quot;The emperor's drink is created from a mixture of cacao beans, vanilla, spices, and chili pods, which make it really hot and spicy!&quot; If you get offered this hot chocolate drink you should feel very special!

It supports the idea that they ate a good diet because they filled the tortilla with fresh ingredients, and in special occasions, fish or other kinds of meat. ANother example that supports the idea of Aztecs eating very well is when also in Source #1, it said Atzecs love vegetables. Aztecs ate all kinds of veggies such as tomatoes, peppers, and squash just to name a few. That idea supports the idea that they ate and enjoyed a good diet because instead of eating dessert, such as cake or something unhealthy, they ate fresh plums, fresh plums, or fruit. The last example that shows the Aztecs ate very well, is when in source #1, they talk about how they eat all kinds of birds. That example supports the idea that they enjoyed a good diet because they loved to hunt and eat food filled with protein.(They even got some excercise as well.)]]>

Another example was on paragraph 1 under Preparing food it says &quot;The Aztecs ate mostly fresh food,&quot; I thought that this was important because fresh food is very good for you and healthy to so that proves that they eat really well.

This is true because in article #1,paragraph4, it says: &quot;Deserts are rare, but you may be served fresh plums or cherries with your meal.&quot; This shows that that they didnt eat much sweets, which isnt good in a healthy diet. But if they did have desert, it was fruit so they still could enjoy a bit of sweetness, and have it still be healthy Also, In article#2 ,paragraph 6: it reads: ''The Aztecs ate mostly fresh food'' This evidence is greatbecause fresh food is is better for you than food that has been sitting in the market or store for a lond period of time. Last, in article 3, paragraph , it reads: ''By desien, chinampas that are farmed in the traditional way have fertile soil. They do not need chemical fertelizers.'' This is great evidence becasue organic foods( in this case chinampas that dont chemical fertelizers) are better for you than foods that use chemicals to keep bugs from eating the crop. In conclusion the Astec diet was very healthy.]]>

According to &quot;Source 2&quot;, it stated that, &quot;The Aztecs ate mostly fresh food, which they bought in the markets every day.&quot; I think this means that, the Aztecs are probably very healthy, because if they use fresh food, there's a good chance that the food won't cause people to get sick. Also, I think the Aztecs enjoy their diet because, they preserve their food, and make new, home-made dishes. Also, according to &quot;Source 2&quot;, it stated that, &quot;The Aztecs cooked on fires, which were lit in hearths inside their houses.&quot; I think this means that, the Aztecs didn't use anything fancy and the Aztecs used their surrondings. According to &quot;Source 2&quot;, it stated that, &quot;Aztec farmers don't keep animals for their meat, but they do go fishing and hunting. This way, they manage to eat a wide range of dishes.&quot; I think this means that, they didn't just focus on one species of animal, they used technique and skill, to hunt, and fish.]]>

In source #3 it states,&quot;A favorite was choclatl, or drinking chocolate, made from beans of the cocao tree.&quot; one of the Aztecs favorite was a chocolate drink. but it is not the kind of chocolate that you would have imagine. they had cocao beans, vanilla, spices and chili pods because they liked everything hot and spicy.]]>

My second example of why the Aztecs ate very well is from the same article. The article quotes &quot; The Aztecs have plenty of fresh ingredients, but you'll need to develop a taste for spicy foods.&quot; This example supports the idea that the Aztecs enjoyed a good diet because the Aztecs ate foods that were edible. The Aztecs also developed a taste for spicy foods. So, if you were to visit the Aztecs today, they would serve you very spicy foods. My third and final example saying the Aztecs ate very well is from the article titled &quot; Saving the Chinampas.&quot; The article states &quot; By design, chinampas that are farmed in the traditional way have fertile soil. They do not need chemical fertilizers.&quot; This example supports the idea that the Aztecs enjoyed a good diet because the food that they ate did not have any chemical fertilizers around them at any time. So, the food the Aztecs ate were very edible. So, as you can now see, the Aztecs had a very healthy and wholesome diet.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Food and Drink- Aztec food is hearty, wholesome, and filling. This example supports the idea that they enjoyed a good diet because saying that it's &quot;hearty, wholesome, and filling&quot; tells you how healthy it is. Varied Vegetables- If you like veggies, you are in for a treat. During your trip you will probably get the chance to eat peppers, tomatoes, leeks, squashes, watercress, and artichokes. Desserts are rare, but you may be served fresh plums or cherries with your meal. This supports the idea that the Aztecs enjoyed a good diet because vegetables are really healthy, and it also says at the end that &quot;desserts are rare&quot; that tells me that they enjoyed a good diet because desserts sre usually unhealthy for so they try not to make them an everyday kind of thing. Very Hot Chocolate- Aztec Emperors like to end each day with a drink of hot chocolate. But it's not like the sweet chocolate drink you may have had. The Emperors drink is created froma mixture of cacao beans, vanilla, spices, and chili pods, which make it really spicy! If you are offered a chocolate drink, you should feel very honored. The Aztecs think that chocolate is the drink of the gods, the commoners are not allowed to try it. I think the text supports the idea that the Aztecs enjoyed a good diet because their hot chocolate is made with spices and other healthy ingredients but the hot chocolate now isn't anywhere near as healthy as it was during the time of the Aztecs.]]>

Also, the Aztecs ate mostly fresh food, which they bought in the markets every day. Another example is, the Aztecs cooked on fires, which were lit in hearths inside their houses. Three stones were arranged in a triangle in the hearth and supported the cooking pots and pans. The stones also support a flat stone griddle.]]>

Some of those were fish, duck, turkey, and deer, the Aztecs also ate parrots, owls, eagles, lizards, and frogs. Birds and insects were also considered a great treat. This supports that the Aztecs ate healthy because different kinds of meats give you protein in order to grow bigger and stronger. In Source #2 we know the Aztecs ate healthy because they had many varied vegetables such as Corn(most important food) Tomatoes, avocados, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pinapples, chocolate, pumpkins, and peanuts were also important to their diet. We also know that this was healthy because vegetables are extremely good for you and their chocolate wasn't like the sugary sweet one we have today it was more of a hot and spicy drink. In Source #3 we know that they ate healthy because they grew most of their crops in the chinampas. If the crops they grew weren't healthy then they probably wouldn't give the Aztecs the food considereng that the chinampas fed the entire population of Mexico City for 30 years!]]>
