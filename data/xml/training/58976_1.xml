Althought, there are also disadvantages as the noise that blades make, or as the impact on the landscape. Turbines are too big, their design is ugly and many people said that it is ruining the rural landscape. These are not the only problems make by this new innovative technology. There may be lightning damages, noise pollution. natural problems such as migration of the birds can be inluenced negatively.]]>

But the counter arguement of the use of wind mills and the disadvantages of wind energy would be that it doesnt allow the use of wind to be working successfully for 24/7, and if the wind isnt powered the whole week then there would be no energy produced and the mills will be useless. Anoher reason why mills shouldnt be continued is that it can casue problems with the wildlife especially migrating birds. This can cause huge problems with maybe even casuing deaths due to the large blades rotating.]]>

Installing the windmills is what causes damage to natural grounds like mountains, forests, and other areas. We dont want to destroy natural areas like those because they provide us with so much, we dont need wind farms taking all that space.

Using the resources that we have has become a very important thing in this wrold due to the fact that we are running out of things or by a certain period of time they will be gone if we as the peopel who inhabit this planet don't change something. The only major issue with this entire situatution is whether or not it is windy,which is why we should do reserach to find where the windest places are in this country. Yes, there may be a few deaths of birds because they don't see the windmills as a threat and they may be a bit noisy and cause things to be a bit difficult, but that is why one should put them as far away from thins as possible. This is one of the few ways to create anergy that we aren't utlizing becasuse we are so set in our ways,but this is a new time where we actually have the technology to make these things possible. This way of creating energy doesn't cause pollution nor radiocactive waste such as using natural gas, oil, or coal which are becoming harder and harder to find due to the fact that we are using so much. The more westart to pay attention to what is going on with the Earth as well as what would be best for it, the easier it will be to survive.]]>

Over the last decade, wind energy has become one of the most cost effective emerging technologies. The disadvantages of wind energy include the wind not blowing. One of the diadvangages of wind energy includes the wind not blowing 24/7. When the wind doesn't blow the windmill blades don't turn. If the wind doesn't blow that day what would we do? For example if there was a natural disaster and all we relied on was wind power, and the wind wasn't blowing then what would we do. I believe we should choose a more reliable energy source.]]>

But actually, it's not always like that. Their are many disadvantages with the wind turbines, even if they are efficient and produce energy. It all depends on where they are located and how much wind, and at what speed there is. The wind speed &quot;varies by 10%, while the actual turbine power varies by 25%.&quot; And it's not just this but the actual power making turbine is a hassle as well. If you ever go travleing through the United States, you will most likely see the wind turbines lined up in a row. But some of them aren't even spinning! Only a few out of the bunch, are actually producing energy. You know its a wind turbine by its own way of ruining the beautiful view of the landscape. Wind turbines, as well as other man-made structures, take away the the beauty of landscapes, forest, and mountains. They could even be a danger to wildlife. They're swo tall, that poor migrating birds might not see, especially at night, and their will our wild life go. They don't add anything to the picture either, they're just there, probably ruining the view of nature. You wouldn't want to go near one either, since they have noisy blades. Consequently, wind turbines are not really that great if you actually think out the many possiblities of why or why not are they really good for us, and wildlife.They are a huge hassle and we should really be thinking about how we can make them even better and more efficient.]]>

They have now, in modern times, become one of the most cost effective technologies. Although they are so, windmills have many disadvantages due to its negative effects on the environment. In order to create windmills, the habitats of many animals are destroyed. New sections of land need to be cleared in order to have a place for the windmills to be. This in turn results in the destruction of homes for many animals, forcing them to become endangered due to the lack of both shelter and food. For example, the production of these windmills causes trees, a bird's home, to be chopped down in order to provide room for these windmills. These birds now don't have any home and are forced to migrate to find a different one. Although windmills don't cause pollution in the air or radioactive waste, it is capable of causing noise pollution. The sounds that the windmills make a very loud and distracting for thet people that live there and help to ruin the pristine and beautiful landscape. Windmills help to make areas that were once beautiful, ugly and uninviting. It is easy of seeing just how efficient windmills are, but one can't deny the negative effects that surround them. In order to produce windmills, the pristine quality of the rural landscape is destroyed, and so is the habitats of various animals. These effects produce drastinc changes in our environment that are both negative and destructive.]]>

One big issue is the fact that the wind isn't always going one 24/7 to actually turn the blades to create the energy. If we are to use this type of renewable energy than we shouldn't need to always worry when the wind isn't blowing anymore so than no more power for the people in that region. Another big factor is since the wind doesn't blow all the time how are we going to get the most energy out of it when the wind does come around? The only way I see it is we are going to have to build a large number of them all over the place which will just create less space for humans to use and it can also take away land animals in the areas live in. Another big issue is what happens if we do solve those problems in the first paragraph and wind power does become Americas sole sorce for power, how are we going to protect the turbines from natural causes? how can we protect the turbnes or any of the other issential equipment needed for all this to work safe from lighting strikes, earthquakes, ect.? We can't surround the turbine in a dome to protect it from lighting because the wind can't reach the turbine to move the blades and we can't somehow stop earthquakes from occuring and destroying the ground around the turbine or completely destroying the turbine itself. Even if we out the turbines in the ocean on sturdy plateforms theres still risks of damages from water spouts (tornado like winds that pick up water when its over the ocean instead of dirt like &quot;normal&quot; tornados), hurricans, typhoons, even to much wind at high speeds have a risk of nocking something out of place or even the turbine. The last major reason of the drawbacks coming from wind power is the cost of ecerything. Even though the cost ofwind power turbines have decreased a substantial amount it is still large funding that has to go into these prodjects that make wind power to expensive to put up all these turbines. Like I said in my first paragraph to get the most use and effecctiveness out of a turbine when the wind finally comes is to have a large amount of them which in tern will need large funding' something that the U.S. can't do right now. It is still cheaper and more effective right now to use non-renewable recourses for most of everything until we find another solution for &quot;clean and renewable energy resourse.&quot;]]>

Wind patterns are unpredictable, and it is often unlikely that wind will continually run through a certain area where the wind generators are. Therefore, the turbines may sit static for long periods of time without generating any electric power. Wind speed varies by 10%, and turbine power varies by 25%. The wind which passes through the turbines also varies on the environment where it is placed. If a turbine is placed near trees, tall buildings or mountains, the wind will be affected by the large structures, and little will pass through the blades of the turbine. Wind turbines are large, ugly contraptions which ruin scenic rural landscapes. The large blades of the turbine are a reminder of failed technology in a place where nature rules its realm. The rotating blades of the generator also endanger native wildlife, including migrating birds, who are struck down from the sky on their way to a better climate. During storms, many wind turbines are struck by lightning. It is expensive to make these required repairs. Comparable to a small jet engine, wind farms create noise pollution which is disturbing to their environment.]]>

For example, the process of creating energy with the wind turbines doesnt happen 24/7. The turbines arent even running that long so if we have a black out or a hurricane, there isnt a garentee that they will insure us power for that long. It also cause noise pollution. The noise of the blades sound like a small jet engine and when nessecary, like flying to your destination, is barrable but when its for an invention that is independable it is ubsurde. Turbines more importantly endanger wild life such as birds and other flying animals. It ruins rural landscapes and obstructs things such as forests, mountians, buildings and many more man-made structures. So why would we waste our time building inventions that only work sometimes or endangers our earth? Why build things that destroy the peace when unesescary?]]>

Wind Farms are not a completely clean renewable resaource. Wind Turbines are very large and ruin rural landscape. Wind Farms production consists of clearing off land through destruction of forest and mountains. In addition to interferring with geography of the land they also endanger wildlife by affecting their food chains and habitats. For example, migrating birds. Windmill Blades hurt migrating birds by either causing them damage themselves or by causing them to take a nother route and delaying their migraton. The outcome of Windmill energy production does not overweigh its disadvantages. Windmills energy production can easily be disrupted. Windmills only operated during windy climate and are not blowing 24/7. Therefore, its engery production percentage does not compare to the engery production from solar power and hydroelectric power. There's a reason why wind turbines only generated 3% of U.S. total electricity. In addition turbines are very sensative to lightning, causing severe and costly damage.]]>

The main issue is that wind power cannot be used at all times making it an unrealible source for people who use it. Also, contrary to the belief that it is beneficial to the enviroment, windmills are located in areas which were formerly places for other ecosystems and thus endangered the wildlife they were built on and also causing pollution in the area. Wind energy is not as a reliable energy source as others because its construction has more drawbacks than benefits. Windmills have been used since colonial times and have since been used nationally by United States farmers. Its construction has brought up many issues as it replaced the untouched landscapes of nature with the man-made structure of the windmill which provided energy, but also interferes with nature. Not to mention the fact that windmills also cause noise pollution and furthur obstructs the natural state of America.]]>

There are times where there is a lull in wind and in these cases how will electricity be provided? On top of the the Wind Power being unreliable they are not only noisy but consume large amounts of space. For those who live in the more rural areas of land the Wind Power can endanger the wild life of which surrounds them. Lastly, this system is supposedly known for being green but, it is ran by a small jet engine which in turn is noise pollution.]]>

Also wind mills do not bring in a constant flow of energy, because the wind does'nt always blow 24/7. Overall wind mills do more harm than good.]]>

Not only is it not always blowing but the speed of wind varies which can slow down the energy being produced. This means that wind isn't the most reliably consistent form of energy. On the other hand, wind can sometimes be very strong and in turn cause noise pollution which is sometimes as loud as a small jet engine. Therefore, the strength of the wind or lack of it can cause many problems. Not only is wind a problem but also the structures that create energy from it. Turbines are very large and are usually built in rural areas. However, this ruins the landscape and there are too many obstructions in other areas (forests, mountains, buildings, etc.) to build anywhere else. Wildlife can also find problems with these structures, such as migrating birds who can get caught in the turbines and become endangered if not already.]]>

One thing that is flawed with this idea is that the wind does not blow 24/7. Some places that do get wind may not even get strong wind so how do these wind mills even benifit them? The blades would have to be placed in a wide area where there will be no obstructions like forests, mountains, buildings, or other man made structures. If they are too close to thos things they will not catch enough wind and if they are too close to residential areas the blades will be too noisy and bother the residents. With these things being in wide open areas it takes away from the natural beauty of the earth. They are oversized and they have an ugly design. It also effects the surrounding wild life because the little animals could possibly get frightened by them and they would have to relocate to an area they are not familiar with and they could not survive in. Birds might also try to pass by as the blades are spinning and may not realize that they are and might get caught in them and get seriously injured or even die. The wind mills could also give off pillution from the small jet engines that they have. It could also be possible that they can get turbine damage from lightning. It seems as if they would attract the lightning.]]>

Many rural farmers complain of the noise produced by these giant wind mills, likened to a small jet engine. Not only is the noise stressful, but migratory birds are often caught by the giant spinning blades. Though the wind farm phenomenon is increasing, not many spare a thought to the lost picturesque landscape polluted by the massive metal structures. Some envirnmentalistrs also forget to mention that these turbines rely on wind, which does not blow all of the time. It takes a massive amout of these wind turbines to produce enough energy to power houses and are increasing in numbers, adding only to the stress of thos put into direct contact with the wind turbines.]]>

People seem to have this idea that wind energy is all natural and that it is helping the environment because it is using nature in order to make engergy, however these windmills have a very negative effect on nature and also the wildlife that sorounds them. We as humans have it in our nature to interfer with what nature already has and windmills are just the same, they are a huge disterbince in the way that things should naturaly be in the landscape where they are put. these are big and noisey machines that fill the area with noise pollution and there aperience destroys the natural beuty of the landscape. On top of this they are also dangerous for the animals that live there, the sounds scare away many animals from there natural habitat and the massive blades or the mills have been known to kill migrating birds, who after flying the same path for many generations encounter a new obstical that many times can result in their death. not only are there all of these negative effects on nature because of the windmills they are also not a very practical source of energy in the first place. You have to understand that in order to be able to harness the power of the wind you have to have wind. there is many times when you see these impressively large mills scattered accross a piece of land and yet not a singe one is turning because of the lack of wind. However when the wind is blwoing and they are actualy serving their purpose these are incredably noisy machines which doesnt only affect nature but also all of the people how have to be anywhere near it. because they are so noisy and horrible to look at this forces them to be biult oin areas where noone goes that would be otherwise untouched my man. although wind mills seem like an alternative source of energy that is envirinmentaly friendly in reality they take away from nature more then they help.]]>

Putting the turbines in locations surrounding communities does not bring that much attraction to the area, students feel as if the turbines are to big, they are an ugly design, and they ruin rural landscapes with the additional noise polution that they provide. This would lead to the obstruction of forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures putting endangered wildlife in jeopardy. Although the turbines are not what most people preffer, studies show that turbine power varies 15% more power than wind speed.

The blades of the windmill are to noisy, this I find as a negative because if people wanted or like noise then would have moved to the city. People come to rural areas for peace and quite not a buzzing of a windmill. The turbines are too big and ugly, this to me just seems like a personal problem.

It is efficient for rural areas, as well as times thatb the electrical grid is disfunctioning. Although it has its disadvantages. In order for Windmills to work properly and provide enough energy, there must be a lot of them in one area. In rural areas they create what are called wind farms, which is a large area of land dedicated to windmills. This takes up alot of space, ruining landscape, as well as any wildlife living there. Windmills are large and arent a pretty sight to see, destroying the natural beauty of the land. With that, the turnines connected to windmills are loud, because of thier small jet enigine. Any reidence near these wind farms will constantly be disturbed by the sound of a running engine, creating noise pollution. This is not beneficial to the earth. There are also many complications that are inclued with the running turbines, they dont run 24/7. This is not reliable, this makes it difficult for residence nearby reliant on the wind energy.]]>

With windmills you have problems like making space for the windmills, we have to sometimes destroy nature and sometimes wildlife. Also another problem with windmills is obviously the wind. If there is no wind, how are we going to generate power for windmills? This can be a constant problem and wind speeds vary from 10% and power varies by 25%. Another problem with windmills are also their shear size. They are massive and sometimes ruin rural landscape because of how much space you need for them, also they need constant repair because of lightning damage.]]>

While there are many choices and different ways that we could produce new amounts of energy, Windmills have been around for years and have prouduced only about 3% of the U.S. electricity. That in contrast to how many individuals live in the United states. Although there are other more benificial methods people have chosen windmills to produce energy. What one may not know is that windmill cause more damage and loss than gain. We only gain a small amount of energy from the wind and miss out on the small amount of extra energy when the windmills are not on. Damageing the agriculture and animal life in the near by areas and living complication. The windmills are not quite or small and they prouduce a lot of obstruction to what could of been a natrual view.

By eliminating these natural resources from our environment, we will be able to se them more effectivly then using them mostly for energy throughout the United States. The source of wind energy is renumable and cost-effective. When an area experienced a disater, such as a earthquake or a hurricane,areas can use Wind power engery to supply energy to places in desperate need. With the new technology, the United states will be able to increase the percentage of energy supplied by wind mills. This will decrease the amount of coal, oil, and natural gas use, which in turn, will benefit the environment. Although wind mills can be an effective and envoronemnt-friendly, there are some disadvantages of using windmills for wind power. the lack of wind is areas can be a disadavantage because without wind, no energy will be produced. The blades increase a discomfort for locals because the blades are loud and seem to riun their home environment. the building of windmills can endanger wildlife and force animals to migrate to differnt spots.

For example, Wind Energy might have been useful in the early 2000's but now that we have modernized society in a variety of forms it would be impossible to contain everyones approval for having machines that create Wind energy. When thinking about this, the writer obviously did not think about landscape issues. Yes the cities around hills and oceans might create a lot of wind energy that could become useful but i what about the deserts? Most of the time its plain humid and the wind energy will not be able to function as well as it should be causeing the project to be both a waste of time and money. I certainly believe that because our society has furthered advanced into the future era's it is unlikely that not only us as humans but the wildlife itself might not be in agreement with the building of energy sources. Just like it can affect us in a positive way, it can affect them in another way which could definitley harm them.]]>

Wrong, if these turbines are built in places where birds migrate they may get caught and die in the vaccume of air created, and what if these birds are endangered? that would mean only less of them in the already sparcely populated world. Another point is these wind turbines are not blowing one hundred percent of the time what if there's no wind in an area for a week or a month what will supply power to those demanding on it? If wind farms are built more it could easily ruin the rural beautiful landscape of our country not to mention the immense noise polution they cause it sounds like a small jet engine! What would the upkeep of these turbines cost if every other month they got hit by lightning and had to be repaired? I believe wind power is an effective solution in theory but in practice we have a long way to go before it should become commercialy available.]]>

I believe its out in the land near the back roads where people take or near part of a freeway. Another disadvantage is how much the wind speed of the area is but these Wind Powers should be put in areas where its not common for someone to live, cities where its mostly windy like, Oakland or San Francisco, around my area i's choose those places. Although the disadvantages are small things compared to how much its had helped us especially in 2012, i think these are great to have for creating our energy.]]>

Windmills are large masses that are extremely dipleasing to the eye. They take up large amounts of land space and they ruin the rural areas that they take up. Windmills are operated by wind energy, however the wind is not always blowing. This means that the windmills do not operate 24/7 and they are not constantly creating energy that we need. The more conservative thing to do would be to cut down on windmills and have those always running. This would constantly supply energy as well as restore all of the damaged land. Another downfall of the windmills is the noise pollution. The turbines can get extremely loud when they are spinning, if you live anywhere near an energy plant, how would you ever get some peace and quite? Besides the sanity of humans, these giant turbines can also be a great danger to wild life. For instance it could destroy the homes of wildlife on the groud, or one of the blades could hit a bird trying to fly through. As appealing as these energy sources may seem, both the pros and the cons need to be looked at before building anymore.]]>

Not only are they insufficient, these extremely large designs are very disruptive in rural landscapes. The turbines have noisy blades, and are much too big to blend in with the plain landscapes. The wind turbines are not sensible in many areas, so space is limited. Some obstructions include forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. These turbines have also been reported to endanger wildlife, especially migrating birds. Lightning damage could also be a serious issue, as these metals designs would be great targets. These large structures are not sensible in this day and age. There are too many inconsistencies with their ability to provide power, and they would need to be placed in places where it would not ruin any natural habitats or landscapes.]]>

A turbine can only generate electricity whilst the wind is blowing, this would mean then that a city entirely reliant on wind power will never have a 24/7 steady inflow of electric power, becaue wind speeds vary. Furthermore with wind speed variations, if the wind speed varies by 10%, the turbines power will vary by 25%. We must not forget as well, wind turbines are very large structures that reach into the sky, and is putting the lives of thousands of birds on a yearly basis all for the sake of our electricity really worth it? Haven't humans killed off enough animals already. Lastly, wind turbines must be very prone to lightning strikes, seeing as how they generate electricty, the materials for which a wind mill is constructed of will be highly conductant. If a wind mill gets struck down at the sight of every thunder storm it can cost the land owners thousands to replace it.]]>

Downsides to using wind mills for wind energy include noisy blades, which creates noise pollution. Also, wind does not blow all the time and energy is only extracted when wind blows. The turbines are too big, ugly, and ruin the beauty of nature. The wildlife would have a hard time adjusting to this man-made creation. Finding a convienent place to put a wind mill near obsrtuctions is hard. For people to bring and build the turbine on a mountain or in a forest is very unconvienent. In case of a storm, the turbine has a very high chance of being struck by lightning. This can also harm nearby wildlife. In conclusion, having wind energy to create electricity is more unconvienent than it is to what we use today.]]>

The wind is not always blowing powerfully enough to turn windmills with enough speed to generate power, and on other occasions it does not blow at all. There can be up to a ten percent difference in wind speed, and this can lead to an upwards of twenty five percent decrease in electrical output, and on the scale of millions of home, the results could be catastrophic. Not only does wind not blow regularly, but it also sometimes cannot blow at all, as natural formations such as hill, trees, or mountains can stop the wind from reaching the windmills, and many artificial structures can do this as well, such as skyscrapers or factories. If homes are built too close, they could potentially block out their own power source, or if the wind does get there, have to live with the equivalent of a small jet turbine constantly droning in their ears daily, as well as having to look at tall, unsightly pillars of whirrling blades constantly spinning and ruining the scenery that used to be there. If inconvenient living wasn't bad enough, then the sight of magled bird bodies would be the final nail in wind powers coffin. Like fishing nets, windmills often catch unlucky, unintenional animals, but unlike fishing nets where the animal has a chance of being noticed and released, a bird caught in a windmill's blades if cut by a sharp sheet of heavy metal, with absolutely no possiblity of recovery. Those who may not care about animal welfare will certainly worry when electrical output drops sharply because a goose hit a blade the wrong way and took down the entire windmill, causing the line to be severed, as well as cutting into profit margins by needing to have to replace it or repair it. For all these reasons, wind power is impractical, unstable, and a mere helping hand to fossil fuel driven plants at best.]]>

Over the past decade wind energy has become increasingly popular, but it is the best choice? One factor to consider is that the wind is not constantly blowing at a strong rate, which means that the less wind there is, the less energy there will be. Another concerning factor is the noisy blades. It would be hard to have this energy become a more prominent energy in the worl without setting up a ton of new windmills all over the place. This means that windmills will probably be placed closer to homes and cities. Noisy blades would no doubt be very disruptive to the people. The windmills would not only be disruptive, they would ruin rural landscape. Along with that, they would also endanger wildlife and migrating birds while causing turbine lightning damage as well. People may want to do a little more research about the harms of wind energy before they decide it's for them.]]>

Wind doesn't always blow and when it doesn't blow there is no way to spin the blades so the turbines won't produce energy. Also, the wind turbines aren't very efficient even when the wind does blow; the wind's speed can vary by 10 percent which causes the turbine power to vary by up to 25 percent. Wind turbines are also a bit of an eyesore. Their giant, boring design ruins the previously beautiful landscapes that were seemingly untouched by humans until we decided to obrstruct the fields with the towers. Aside from being ugly, they are also very noisy and the noise created by the turbines is just as hideous and obstructive as the turbines themselves.]]>

Wind energy is a good source of power that creates less polutioin, but it requires certain conditions to be able to produce a good amount of energy. The wind is not always blowing where the turbines are so they aren't always generating electricity. We can't depend on this type of energy because if we do need energy at a point turbines won't be able to produce if their is no wind. Also the people living around them will be extremely discomfortable becuase of all the noise it will be making.

First of all one has to account for the variation involved. Wind turbines depend on the unpredictable force of wind. Wind isn't always blowing, and even when blowing wind speed varies by ten percent. This means wind is not a constant energy source and its also unstable, as wind turbines power varies by tweny-five percent! Furthermoe wind farms can not be placed near and forests, mountains, or structures. Furthermore, Wind turbines are an expensive danger. Turbines suffer lightning damage and are a nasty eye sore. If their big, ugly design wasnt enough they also cause noice pollution and a farm is as loud as a jet engine! Even worse wind turbines can kill wildlife. Such as endangered species and migrating birds. All in all wind turbines are not a relaible source of energy and they cause much more damage than they are worth!]]>

There are a few disadvantages to having this type of power used more often. For instance, wild life might be the most affected by this source. Not only does the WInd Power endanger wildlife, but it changes the lifestyle they are used to. Birds are used to flying freely, usually not having to worry about what is going to endanger their lives in the air. These turbines also pave way to the unnatural feel within nature. Nature's purpose is to be natural and untouched. With the new designs and with the excessive amount of space they take up, these windmills are bound to disrupt what is considered natural. Not only do wind mills lead to obvious disadvantages, but are not a reliable source of energy. Relying on Wind Power would be considered the appropriate decision, but what one doesn't notice is that this leads to the dependency of this source. Wind mills are not designed to work 24/7 and should be thought out to work this way. This goes for wind as well, it is not guaranteed that wind is to be coming in every single minute of the day. Wind is usually never predictable and becomes an issue when people start to rely on it, as the only source of energy. There should be other options in energy and cost efficient energy because this type is not reliable as well as safe. Despite the costs, there are far more other issues that could be present, that outweigh these beneficial savings.]]>

For example, the wind mills create dangers for animals, especially for high-flying birds. Not only is the wildlife affected, but also, the beautiful farm landscape is tarnished from giant, metal structures. Turbines also make a significant amount of noise which is very similar to that of a small jet engine. Although the benefits of wind-generated power may seem significant, they create dangers to the environment as well.]]>

There are some downsides to wind power however. These negative aspects include: noisiness, the wind not blowing at all times, the obstructions that block the wind from generating power, the massive turbines, the variation of wind speed correlating with wind power, wildlife such as birds becoming obstruced in the blades of the windmill, lightning damage that the turbines receive during storms, and the noise pollution that the turbines generate. These disadvantages of wind power have led many to argue whether or not wind power is actually worth using when it is much more efficient (though harmful) to just use gasoline, or other sources of energy that are faster in producing power.]]>

One renewable resource that has gained popularity is wind power. However, wind power is not a viable energy alternative due to its sporatic nature and its appearance. Wind as a force of nature is neither predictable or contollable. We cannot predict when and where wind will blow most frequently and heavily. Although wind turbines can be placed in areas where wind can be expected to blow, there is no guarantee that it actually will. Therefore, it is ineffecient to build expensive turbines when they may prove useless. Also, wind turbines are not pleasant to look at and can hurt the enviroment in some ways. Nobody wants to see a large wind farm obstructing their view of a landscape. Turbines are large and loud and hinder one from having a positive expeience in areas where turbines are plenitful. Also, there is some concern to the safety of wildlife due to turbines. No, they don't produce toxic waste, but they do have large blades that can catch flying birds quite easily, killing them. Wind power is not a strong option for a renewable energy source due to its unpredictable and inefficient nature and its enviromental and asthetic impact.]]>

The windmills are generally placed in areas with an abundance of wind which tend to be out in the wild away from urban life. This destroys the environment and leads to deforestation. The windmills that happen to be close to cities tend to be a nuisance towards those living in the cities due to the noisy blades and noise pollution caused by the small jet engine. Along with these flaws comes the lack of reliablity that is presented by the windmills. The wind is not constant, and is difficult for the windmills to be working 24/7 due to the unpredictablity of nature.]]>

Now, imagine we had windmills and a national park or just a beautiful landscape the windmills would make it look terrible. In my point of view i believe that the the winmills would ruin rual landscapes. Then if they ever did start putting windmills all over the places it would cause obstrustions int the forests, montains, buildings, and any other man-made structure. Why would we want to build structrues so they will bring it down for windmills? If they do not do it in an open place and go to forest or places like that there is many endangered wildlife that we would be taking homs from.]]>

Quite a bit of the time the turbines don't even move because their is not enough wind in the air, so they just sit there doing nothing to benefit us. Wind turbines are sometimes build on nice, green, fresh looking land but once build, the turbines make it not so good looking anymore, ruining landscapes. A wind turbines speed ranges from about 10% to 25% sometimes hitting bird killing them. This is the cause for bird migration and them moving to another place to live because the turbines have taken their land.]]>

One of the biggest factors leaning towards the opposition of using wind power is that wind is not always blowing. Without the wind blowing, it's difficult to actually produce electricity from the wind. The windmills and their turbines also take up a lot of space, especially when people build entire farms of them. You must find rural terrain, seeing as you can't exactly efficiently (or safely) build them on mountains. Rural areas are some of the last places available for humans to contsruct places to live, so there is a constant debate on what to do with the rural areas we find. Finally, wind farms are very noisy. A single windmill has loud blades by itself, but an entire farm would not be pleasant to live and sleep next to. Even some species of bird are endangered because of the spinning blades! All in all, even though wind energy is clean and non-polluting, it is not an effective option to stick with.]]>

The power generated from these wind power rely soley on how much wind passes through it. This means if there is no wind, they wont produce power. Wind turbines aren't really a reliable source of power yet. we can't just get power from it whenever we need it so instead we just incorporate it with our current supply of power from powerplants. A Turbine is a giant piece of moving machinery. A fastly spinning turbine can easily take out a flock of birds or disrupt them. Flying animals are a risky exchange for wind energy. If we produce too many of these it could slowly remove the population of bird species, and upset the natural balance of our wildlife. Turbines can get a little on the noisy side. Spinning blades produce noise that could scare off wild life or just even annoy other. Imagine a giant group of these power producers next to each other, they would collectively create noise to unsatisfy people.]]>

I do not believe so, the weather varies all the time, we can not sit and wait for some wind to have power. Also, the blades of the Windmills are very noisy, it is more of a nuesence then a source of power. Where would we place these new structures, and how would we silence the very noisy blades? We can not silence them, and there will be complaining citizens who have to live near these windmills. We want a reliable source of energy that will not be a disturbance to people. And that is why me must keep our Electric Companies. The Windmills that are going to be structured in different areas will also be a hazzard for migrating birds. It will endanger a wildlife, and all for the cause of unreliable power. The birds who migrate will be injured or even killed from these dangerous blades. Wildlife will not be safe. We will destroy forest and trees to build these Windmills. There are far too many consequences of this Wind Power and we must not change our Electric Power resource.]]>

This old-fashioned form of attaining energy is still commonly used today. This form of acquiring energy is one of the least effective ways to attain energy. The collection of Wind Power is unreliable, inconvenient, and dangerous, to say the least. Wind Power should not be used as a source of energy any longer. Wind turbines and wind farms are unreliable. It is difficult to ever know when and how hard the the wind will be blowing. If anyone who relies on Wind Power ever gets caught in a power outage, they will not be able to ever be sure if and when the wind will blow hard enough for electricity to return. Furthermore, wind turbines are inconvenience to society. There is plenty of land across the United States that can no longer be put to good use because of the physical obstructions that have been planted there. Lastly, wind turbines are dangerous. Any unsuspecting airborne organisms may find themselves caught in the full swing of a turbine. They have the noise level of small jet engines and will increasingly contribute to noise pollution wherever they are construction. Finally, they are an easy and ideal target for lighting, adding to the list of liabilities. Wind Power is unreliable and should not be used a primary source of energy.]]>

The problem with it not being 100% reliable is that they'll never be blowing 24/7. And with out them blowing 24/7 then everyone counting on them wont always be able to have electricity generated to them. Not only is it unreliable, it ruins the beauty of any landscape. For example driving to Palm Springs and seeing all those windmills really destroys the true beauty. The noise itself already bothers humans, how do you think the animals feel? True beauty can also be the endagered animals trying to surive or the migrating birds trying to migrate! It throws the animals off from really striving for what they are trying to fullfil. Having windmills to generate the energy we need shouldnt be something we need to rely on becuase the amount of the blades blowing relies on the weather. The faster they try to get it moving the noisier itll get. All in all the windmills worked great in the early 1900's but now with all this technoolgy we have it wont hurt to use it for a couple days and find research and create something new instead.]]>

Windmills are expensive tools and can attract electricty due to their makeup being of metal, a strike of lightning could cause a large quantaty of expenses to the owners of the mills.

Although it can be considered as one of the most effective and resourceful ways to create energy, it endangers wildlife such as migrating birds and/or any other animal flying within its course. Not only that, but the wind mills arent even opperating 24/7 and when they are in operation, the blades become very noisy and creates noise pollution that comes from the small jet engine that helps them run. When trying to find more ways to generate energy, it is important to keep in mind the enviornment and how it may effect the region in a negative way.]]>

However, is wind energy ideal for most Americans? Not everyopne in the United States live in an area where the wind is of great abundance, nor do they have the property mass to sustain a windmill. With these disadvantages, having and opperating a windmill is seemingly obsurd to the average American citizen. Not only does having a giant windmill in your front yard seem pointless, but the price of building one of these windmills is probably exponencialy high considering the amount of money that most people make.]]>

Many praise this source of energy praising its amazing contribution and efficiency. However, although wind power has many advantages, trade-offs are inevitable. Wind energy has its disadvantages in the aspects of instability, aesthetic degradation, noise pollution, and damage towards biomass. Though wind is a renewable and sustaining resource, it is unreliable. Wind has many different patterns, and sometimes it does not blow at all. This instability may cause problems during crucial times. Also, because wind energy demands the implemetation of blades and turbines, much land may be required for its setting. Therefore, the big and ugly turbines may ruin aesthetic rural landscape and thus become bring in complaints. These turbines also produce noise that is like a small jet engine. Noise pollution may damage the ears and bring inconvenience towards the people living in that area. And finally, while these turbines are operating, poor little birds may fly right towards the spinning turbines and become slaughtered. There is no doub that wind energy is amazing and environmentally friendly. Many benefit from it. However, as wind energy eradicates issues provided by other energy sources, it brings in new problems on the other hand.]]>

The wind turbines that are built obstruct the landscape of beautiful places and disrupts the community that nature has put there. The turbines provide a direct threat to migrating birds due to the fact that the blades could injure and possibly kill them. Another fault with wind energy is that the wind is not blowing all the time. It is unpredictable. With wind turbines, one is at the mercy of mother nature. They can also be damaged by lightning when a storm is present. This would put a hefty financial tole on anyone who has wind turbines.

Either we have electricity, or we don't. In the case of the opposing side, turbines create pollution that is not damaging to the environment at all. Blades making too much noise is insensible, sources of wind come only in isolated planes regions where human populations are scarce. Their aesthetic qualities are negligible when one sees them operating in the lancscape of a distant region, likely unpopulated by humans. The only valid argument that offers detriment to the wind-powered society is the idea that wind ddoes not blow 24/7.

Although wind turbines are a greener alternative, there are deterrents that should be exposed too. One being the inappropriately large design which makes the rural landscape in which the generators sit heavy and busy to look at. Already there is an overabundance of industrial building throughout America, and this adds fuel to the fire. Not only can there be a better way to design these power generating giants, but one that might even cost less and generate ever more power for our growing cities. The endangerment of wildlife also poses a problem. Can we design these turbines to be less of a hazard for the indigenous birds that let our ecosystem thrive and our planet stay beautiful? It's ideal that new designs come about. There is already such a burden taking a toll on our earth with all of the power plants, industrial compounds, cities, and various manmade environments that are overloading the surface of what we live and breathe on. There must be an even more conscious way to gain power to satsify the growing demands of our world today.]]>

How will those problems be dealt with or resolved? Comparing the positive and negative impacts of the wind turbine conveys the negative impact outweighing the positive. The turbines can cause a potential harm to wildlife that lives near or around areas with wind turbines. An example can be seen from birds who migrate north and south by the seasons. These migrating birds will now have a threat to their ability to safely travel which is caused by wind turbines. Birds can be injured or even killed by flying through a working turbine which will result an increase in the injuries of birds. Buliding new turbines to areas also affect the wildlife because homes will be destroyed and will lead to a rise in endangered wildlife. Energy created by wind turbines is a clean source, but it isn't as reliable as other sources of energy. Wind turbines solely depend on a suffiecient amount of wind to cause them to rotate. If winds isn't constant or strong enough the wind turbines then become large posts standing and doing nothing. Wind speed varies by 10% which will also result in a differentiation of energy produced from day to day. The impact wind turbines have on other parts of the environment and its unreliablility leave issues of wind energy being a good, strong soure of energy.]]>

A disadvantage of wind energy is that windmills do not blow 24/7. Though the apparatus is less harmful than other means of creating energy, it is also unrealiable. Sure windmills are &quot;clean [sources] of energy,&quot; but can we rely on these windmills at all times? If the windmills are not working 24/7 due to lack of ideal weather, then they are obviously not capable of being dependent on when it comes to electricity. Furthermore, windmills also interrupt our wildlife. Everyone is aware of the time of the year when birds migrate south for warmth. By having these huge and robust windmills around, we are halting birds' natural right of migration and we are potentially capable of harming them. When wind speeds pick up, the windmills correspondingly speed up; if a flock of birds were to come across one of the contraptions, a situation would indeed arise. As important as the cleanliness of our energy sources are needed, the safety and conservation of nature and its inhabitants should always be the primary concern.]]>

The first disadvantage, and probably the most imporant, is the event in which the wind doesn't blow or that it rains. Assume an entire community decids to use windmills to power their facilities and there is no wind or it rains and their is lightning. In this event there wouldn't be any energy in that neighborhood and the residents wouldn't be able to live comfortably. The second problem resulting from windmills is the likelihood that it will pose a treat to endangered wildlife and migrating birds and the obstruction of natural forests. As of right now there are many birds in the state of California that are at risk of going extinct due to things such incificitnt resources. Organizations cut down and destroy the habitats of these birds and leave them with no place to live resulting in the endangering of these species or worse, extinction. Birds are also in danger because of these windmills because they have lond blades that spin fast so it may be hard for a bird to determine whether flying near them is safe or not.]]>

There can be no obstructions so that means trees and the like must go. They aren't small little turbines, they are huge and you need a lot of them to make a significant amount of energy. This means you will have to destroy acres of natural landscape. Wind is never ending but our wildlife is. Windmills are in danger of lightning strikes. So if you plan on creating a windmill farm, you better look out areas that have a lot of lightning storms. This narrows down the extremely narrow areas in which a windmill farm can be placed. Now you can't put these farms in a windy place because there is a terribly high amount of thunder storms. You just wasted all that time and money.]]>

The disadvantages of wind power are the wind doesn't blow 24/7, it would endanger wildlife, and it has to face many obstructions. This leads to it causing more harm than good. First of all, wind power becomes a waste of money and resources because the wind doesn't continually blow. When the wind doesn't blow, no energy is created and it is not as effecient. These turbines are obviously dependent on the wind, that is sporadic at best. The wind is unpredictable and it is a fact that it doesn't blow all day. This makes it a risk and causes those who invest in wind power to lose money. The turbines used for wind power would endanger wildlife, specifically migrating birds. The massive blades would obstruct the flight path of many birds thus creating a hazardous situation. This endangers them and hurts the enviornment when ironically, its purpose is to help the enviornment by inhibiting pollution. Another aspect of the enviornment that it endangers is the obstructions it faces that need to be taken down, in order for the turbines to be in place. That includes forests and things of nature that would need to be removed in order for the turbines to be used. This hurts the enviornment more than it helps. Also the objects that can't be removed are a problem wind power would face. You can't remove permanant things of nature like mountains or anything of the sort. Lastly there are man-made structures, like buildings, that cost money to make and would cost money to take down. Add in the money it takes to make these turbines and you are looking at the expense outweighing the profit. In conclusion, wind power is a innovative idea with good intentions but its disadvantages hold more weight. The turbines used would endanger wildlife and the ecosystem because of obstructions and its placement. Also it would cost more money than it would produce because the wind doesn't blow constantly and the man-made structures it would have to go through.]]>

This may cause some disadvantages to many picky and fancy people. Many people may even call it a waste of space because of the way it looks and its design. Not to mention all the racket it makes. It may even cause you your sleep. You never know when it is going to cause all the noise distraction. That isn't the worse part. There is always migrating birds, what if their species is endangered?

Turbines are huge, ugly, and very noisy. People will not want to live in a community powered by wind if they have to live next to a disgusting wind farm. Wind farms also create many probems for the environment. They can endanger wildlife and migrating birds and they also cause a lot of noise pollution becasue windmills are powered by small jet engines.

Wind energy is not completely efficient because wind is not constantly blowing 24 hours a day. They are also hard to place because they loud, big, and need to be in an area with little obstructions and high wind speeds. Creating more turbines with large blades can endanger birds that are migrating to the south. This will happen increasingly often, due to the fact that in order to make it a viable source of energy there will have to be giant wind farms all across the country. Wind energy is not the solution the the energy crisis.]]>

Wind is not an entirely predictable force; wind speed varies by 10% in most locations. Other obstructions, such as forests, mountains, and man-made structures, can serve as barriers to the wind-flow, cutting off wind from the turbine locations. Wind is not constant, and times of stiller air could result in a loss of energy, especially to a population entirely dependent upon wind energy. While wind energy is hailed as a &quot;green&quot; alternative to current energy sources, the turbines necessary for generating Wind Power bear their own ecological implications. Turbines create a very real threat to already endangered wildlife, especially migratory birds. These bird are not familiar with the turbines and are often injured by the large propellors. Wind farms also present complications to human populations. The noise pollution produced by a wind farm is equivilent to that produced by a small jet engine. Turbines are bulky and almost agressively contemporary, and their presence often scars previously rural landscapes. The complications associated with Wind Power override any benefits Wind Power might provide.]]>

Wind can't to relied on as a source of electricty for people's homes becasue it doesn't blow all day long.

Another, reason why wind isn't a good source of energy is that it is noisy and creates noise pollution. These turbines aren't wanted around homes and businesses becasue they are as noisy as a small jey engine. Noise like that is unwanted around homes becuase it disturbs the people inside. Another disadvantage to wind turbines is that they are very big and aren't wanted on rural landscapes.

For instance since windmills are not a natural structure but rather man-made, they are endagering wildlife such as birds. We choose to destroy trees and other plantlife in order to place these large obstructions in the ground. As a result the trees that once acted as the homes for thousands of birds are now chopped down and obliterated. Therefore the birds have no other choice but to migrate to other places. Not only do windmills cause harm to animals but also to forests as well. Trees and the natural habitat that deer, rabbits, and of course birds once lived in are gradually being torn down and destroyed. Although this is deemed beneficial for powering the country, it does more harm than good. Eventually, if we continue like this animals that we see everday will be nothing more than a distant memory. One other drawback about windmills is that they are not blowing 24/7 thus power becomes little with wind speed varying at 10% and power varying b 25%. During the night or on particularly calm days, wind will not pass by the windmills. As a result there is no power being introduced to the windmills. Now even though these structures were created to sustain clean, natural power they are not always reliable.]]>

Wind turbines are ineffecrive largely because of their size and installation process. Wind turbines are very big and obstruct rural landscapes. Due to their size, they can only be placed in areas with few obstrctions, making it difficult to power large cities. They are a danger to wildlife in the area and can confuse migrant birds. Turbine effectiveness is also disputed. They do not blow at all hours of the day, and even the their effectiveness can vary up to 25 percent. Fore these reasons, turbines are diffcult to use in a practical setting.]]>

One might think that wind power helps decline our use on non-renewable resources, however, the large size and number of windmills destroy natural habitats for animals. It also forces us to obstruct forests and mountains, other already declining areas. Lightning damage, noise polution, and as ugly design are also factors that would have to be tolerated. On top of the danger it poses to wildlife, their habitat, and its inconveinces, the windmill's power is not certain. It depends on unmanipulatable factors that can never be relied upon. If our energy source depended solely on wind power, it would fluctuate between being able to support citizens to being forced to ration and even live without power.

Although the idea of a renuable energy source such as windmill energy is good in theory, the blades are large, noisy and unattractive. This type of energy also costs more currently because experimenting with the technology is so costly. Although these windmills claim to be the most enviormentally friendly option, the windmills themselves take up a lot of space in rural areas, endangering wildlife. Finally, the wind does not blow constantly, which means the windmills will be collecting less energy on calm days. We cannot be reliant on only having energy when the wind blows.]]>

Wind is a force that no one person can control, and in most climates it doesn't blow 24/7, therefore there could be hours upon hours of the day where we would not have energy. Also, the people who live near wind mills often complain about how noisy they are, if they move at all. Another thing residents complain about is the sheer ugliness that the mills bring to the area they inhabit. Once you had a beautiful mountain, and after the mills are installed you now have a mountain with hideous wind mills. It also prooves hard to even find a place to build them, it seems. If you want to build a wind mill, tyhere would need to be no obstructions that would block the wind flow such as forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. After this, and you find an eligable place to build the mill, you would set it up and discover that wind speeds varies by only 10%, while turbine power varies by 25%, which is incredibly low. This being said, you would need to either take the mill down or to build at least ten more. The wind mills are also known for killing or endangering the life of already endangered species of migrating birds.]]>

The truth is the wind doesn't come every minute of every day, it comes whenever it wants to- which isn't the best way to rely on energy that we desprately need. Another issue is how we build them, nature is everywhere and if we decide to cut down trees to make room to build these unreliable windmills, then we get nowhere fast. So the next time we think whats the best way to better the environment we should rethink loud noisy windmills and go with something more efficient.]]>

The only way for the windmills to generate electricity is for the wind to be blowing, if there is no wind there is no energy. For example, Southern California is acclaimed to have a lot of wind, so California would be able to harness this energy, but what about Colarado? Colorado gets little to no wind. Also, Colorado is home of the Rockie Mountains, a setting not suitable for windmills. Windmills would not be able to be constucted due to these obstructions. Lastly, the turbines that generate electricity are very loud. Many people complain because it is a nuissance and disrupt their peace peace and quiet.]]>

They pose a threat to wildlife and make the environment look like it is stamped with the mark of modernization. The blades also pose a problem due to the amount of noise that they produce. This, along with its intimidating stature can cause aniamls to stay away from areas utilizing windpower energy.

For example, wind power has been raved about as being a great and new way of obtaining energy but it has many problems that are overseen. The turbines that create the power are ran by the wind and wind is not always blowing which could lead to the turbine stalling and not generating energy. Another flaw is that the turbines are extremely large and ruin the rural landscape when they are placed into these new areas. The turbines also put wildlife and migrating birds in danger as they take up a large part of the sky and the birds could be injured by the blades.

However, questions still arise as to how substantial wind energy have actually reduced pollution as well as provide a consistently clean energy source. Wind power is widely limited by geographic boundaries and degredates wildlife. Wind power needs to be located in areas with a large amount of wind flowing into the area. Most windmills are located in rural areas where wildlife may have thrived before these urban generators came to use. The blades of windmills are not protected by any gate, thus making birds vulnerable to flying into the blades. Although wind power reduces pollutants in the air, it further endangers ecosystems and its inhabitants. Furthermore, windmills need to be located in areas that get a persistent amount of wind to power the mills.]]>

Wind mills certainly have the power to bring in significant amounts of energy to industrial and recreational machines, but are they worth it? Given differing weather patterns and daily fluctuations, the amount of wind energy that can be harnassed varies by the hour, decreasing reliability for anyone depending on only one or two turbines. Of course, if wind power generation becomes more popular, there will be wind farms across the U.S. and maybe the rest of the planet, but a great number of private property owners will want to take advantage of the resource for themselves, which will leave them with an inconstant energy supply. On top of the reliability issue, there is the matter of cost. Every single would-be wind farm requires many powerful turbines, which are not cheap. Each turbine will undoubtedly save money that might be spent on more traditional energy sources, but that money will need to be spent on maintenance and development of the turbines. With the high costs of wind energy equipment, it would take -at least- decades to reach a point in time where the low energy costs would compensate for the extreme initial costs. So, in a time of severe national debt and government concern over international social conflicts, mass spending by government offices for the sake of a long-term, somewhat experimental project can wait.]]>

These Turbines are far too big, taking up much needed agricultural space and they ruin the land they stand on. They prevent any real growth, of industry or nature. It relies soley on wind power, making it a shot in the dark each day. The propellers move the blades, causing the deaths of birds that migrate.

It does not blow all the time so the power it is producing is also inconsistant. Also, if there is a lightning storm it will ruin the turbine and they are not a cheap replacement. Another problem with turbines is that they are not the prettiest design in the world and they ruin rural landscapes and could possibly endanger wildlife that migrate. Birds could get harmed by the turbine and they could harm the turbine and that will just be more expenses the tax payers will have to pay. While we are on the topic of tax payer, wind turbines are not cheap at all! It will cost the average person more each year and some families can not afford to pay higher taxes.]]>

In today's world, there are thousands of obstructions to get in the way of the turbines, and it wouldn't be cost-efficient to allow the turbines to operate below maximum efficiency. Another reason that wind energy is harmful to the environment is that it endangers wildlife. Any birds that may be migrating could get pulled towards the turbine because of the gravitational pull generated by the blades. Animals wouldn't know any better to avoid the blades and this could cause damage to the turbine itself and possibly death for the animal. Another key reason that wind energy is a bad idea is the noise pollution it generates. ...]]>

The wind doesnt even stay constant, wind speed vary by 10% and the turbine power varies by 25%. People place winmills on top of hills and in places free of obstructions, but most of the time we take down forests to place our wuindmills.

Windmills turn in the wind and generate energy, however they do not blow at all times of the day. Without wind they cannot turn, thus no energy can be generated from the windmills. There are wind farms, places with vast amounts of windmills to generate energy. These windmills have large and noisy blades, leading to noise pollution. This would be a large problem especially for people who live in areas with wind farms or even live nearby. Noise pollution is a distraction and a nuisance. Wind energy is also a danger for birds. Migrating birds can fly towards the windmills and get caught by the blades. They may even think it is a nice resting place while migrating. This has led to endangerment of many birds and several other wildlife species near wind farms. Wind energy is a clean source of energy, but it is not always reliable, or noise-free, or a safe, harmless source of energy.]]>

There is multiple reasons why windmills should be used. For instance, there is usually wind that has the power to spin the mill, which causes electricity to happened; however, the wind may not always be there, thus created few to no electricity. But the source of electricity comes from water and sun that is also not as destructive to the environment/animal habitats. This would eliminate the &quot;endangering wildlife&quot; because animals are not as dumb as people portray them to be partially because they have adapted in order to survive. There are millions of people alone in the country of the United States and we use a lot of energy. With this knowledge we know that the winds cannot produce the amount of electricity needed to keep the population happy. Ultimately, there must be other resources to keep the continual flow of electricity.]]>

They also endanger the lives of migrating wildlife. The killing of these endangered animals is not worth the extra energy it provides. These big, ugly designs ruin the landscapes and beautiful countryside that we pride ourselves on, not to mention that they dont even work one hundred percent of the time. These windmills need a certain amound of wind that they dont even get! The noise pollution also contributes to the list of environmental disadvantages they have. Another reason why wind farms are not a great idea is that they cause obstructions of forests, mountains and are replaced by ugly manmade structures. They are also easy lightning targets and will get damaged often. Windmills can be helpful in certain ways but the disadvantages are just as important.]]>

Not many people in the country have access to wind energy, only the western and mid-western part of the country leaving the east coast to find alternatives ways of energy resources. Wind energy is not a source that is vary long lasting that we can actually depend on all the times; wind mills don't blow at all time everyday. And the wind speeds only go up to 10%-25% turbine power, making the wind mills not fast enough to produce enoug energy.Wind mills can also cause noise polllution, creating a disturbance to the area surrounding it. Not only do the turbines not having enough speed, they aslo cause lighting damage around the surrounding area, making this source a hazard for life around it.Wind mills also can cause animals to be in danger with the amount of hazards that come with having wind mills. Installing windmills can put a lot of wildlife into danger, for migrating birds. The speed that the blades are going at can kill an innocent bird in seconds. Not only do they effect bird but they can ruin the landscape around, where wildlife can be found destroying their homes, and ultumitaley killing the wildlife. Overall wind mills isn't the best source of energy because of its effects on the enviroment can lead to dangerous consequences.]]>

But obstructions such as forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures exist everywhere. When the wind speed varies by 10%, the turbine power varies by 25%. The wind doesn't blow 24/7 so there will be a such long time that the generators don't work. Wind energy has bad effects on environment and human too. The noisy blades lead to noise pollution. A wind farm can produce noise the same as a small jet engine. And turbine also produces lignhning damage. Turbines are too big and ruin rural landscape.

On rainy days it can help by blowing the rain around so it can water are food sourses well. It says that the wind isnt blowing 24/7. Well with the help of the windmills it can blow all the time. Now days things are advansing everyday. Over the years if we do start using windmills than can always update them and make them diffrent ways. I dont see why it would endanger birds and other wildlife. I think the wind would help them fly. Not strong winds but mild winds.]]>

The opposing point of view is that wind energy is, in fact, not that good. Wind power may be free and efficent at times, but what about in the world we live in? Our world of constant technology usage and needing electricity 24/7. A wind turbine would not be able to blow 24/7 due to many obstacles that it has to face. Wind energy wouldn't work as welll if there are mountains, forests, buildings, and simply just man-made structures along the way. Imagine having to do something extremely pivotal late at night, and the electricity dying because there is a storm. This would be an awful experience. This is just the basics of the disadvantages of wind energy. Another negative argument is that it could disturb the environment. Not only would turbines look ugly and be loud, but they would disturb the wildlife of birds. Birds wouldn't be able to freely roam around with turbines trying to chop them. Wild turbines would overall just be a disaster for the generation today. There was a reason it worked back in the late 1920s, when people weren't constantly transfixed by phones, social media, and the start of it all: electricity. One cannot take if the electricity goes down once every year, how can an individual take an unreliable source into account?]]>

For example, these extremely large fan like wind power promotors don't blow 24/7. What does that mean? you might ask yourself. Well this means that when the large fan isn't rotating you wont have electricity. You won't have light and you won't be able to use anything that requires electricity like the Tv or a curling iron. Another downside to wind power is that due to their large complection they require a large amount of space to be made. Therefore obstructions have been made in forestest or man made structures have been brought down to set up these large fans, causing endangered wildlife or lost jobs. Could it be that we are paying a bigger price we can afford for Wind Power?]]>

Yes on the shoreline and at the top of a hill wind is constant, but there are only so many areas we can fill up with these turbines and most of them happen to be National Landmarks or National Parks. By putting these turbines in the middle of these areas we would be disrupting the natural habitat of the animals that live there, and we'd be imposing a definate threat to the birds in the wildlife in which we place our turbines. The wind turbines would also pose a huge threat to forests or dry areas due to the fact that they are basically large conductors waiting to be hit by lightning. The turbines would also just be an obnoxious addition to any landscape due to their largness and how loud they are when operational.]]>

Wind Power is pretty self explanitory, but if you dig a little deeper you will realize only certain areas contain the abundance of wind speeds needed to make wind power effective. Even in certain locations where wind is abundant the wind is normally not blowing 100% of the time. It would be difficult during a time where the winds are not up to speed with what is needed.We need to be prepared for all types of weather in vast locations not only concerned with one region. Windmills are the source of wind energy . They were used long ago by the American colonists to grind wheat and corn, to pump water , and to cut wood at sawmills. If you hae ever seen a windmill you would know just how gigantic and unappealing they are especially in areas where landscaping is a huge pride. They have a basic design and take up a great deal of space.Due to the huge size of the windmills space needs to be made for them usually taking away from forests, mountains buildings, and many more structures. Though windmills do not creates certain types of pollution it is the source of noise pollution. The blades used to generate energy are so disruptive, I could not imagine living near a multitude of windmills. It is not only horrible noise wise but also can be a huge danger to wildlife especially migrating birds . These are all issues that need to be considered in deciding if wind energy has more disadvantages than advantages. The last thing we would need is for the bad to out weigh the good .]]>

Windmills can ruin the beauty of natural landscapes with their dimensions and color scheme. Natural landscape will compose of simple plantlife and hills. The large design will lure your eyes away from the natural beauty straight to the large structure with its loud blades. This design is not only disgusting to lay eyes upon but it can endanger the wildlife that may rome near. Though the power of wind energy is eviromentally friendly for the reason that it creates less pollution to the envioroment, it places danger in the direction of migrating wildlife and for its ability to draw lightning. Migrating birds can be placed into danger due the windmill's large exposed blades if the birds do not fly high enough or far enough from the mill's location. What makes things a whole lot worse for the wildlife that roam near, is that not only do the birds get blended but during a storm sometimes these windmills will act as a lightning rods. So, not only do unsuspecting animals get injured but the community will have to pay for the cost of repair during a storm. The previous flaws of the windmill can be over looked due to their helpfulness, but how helpful are these mills when there are very meak winds that day? Nature is unpredicatable, no person is capable of controlling the wind to ensure that the mill's blades are constantly turning. Wind is not consistant so these mill's will sometimes need to be substituted with fossil fuels for the days where there are no wind.]]>

A rural area has beauty from the emptiness of the landscape but if we add wind energy the turbines are so big with an ugly design that it will ruin the rural landscape. It can cause obstruction to forests,mountains, buildings, and other man-made structutres. If the speed of the wind changes about 10% then 25% of the turbine power varies as well. It will hurt endagered wildlife and can cause death to birds in migration. It can cause turbine lightning damage. Wind energy is one of the ways we can produce clean and efficient energy. The design of he turbines don't cause much noise because it has been improved over the years and will keep improiving. It will not cause obstructions to rural landscape it will enhance the landscape with the design and will cause admiration. Birds that migrate technically fly higher so it wiuld not cause as much damage to wildlife. The wind does not blow constantly 24/7 but it does blow enough to keeo the turbine going.]]>

For one, wind energy cannot blow cosistantly, thus creating abnormal energy patterns. This issue can cause low energy power for quick energy usage. Although the article states that wind power can &quot;generate engery for large number of people,&quot; it does not state how long the energy takes to create; this time limit can play a huge factor in why windmills are not efficient. Windmills can also be a huge disturbance to cities and wildlife; cities will be disturbed by the constant noise of the machines and the pollution caused by the wind wiping all the dust, trash, and unnecesary things to one spot. In order to have a windmill or a windmill farm, farms, forests, buildings, and other areas most be cleared. This sacrfice is not worth trying to alliviate 3% of the U.S' energy; places such as forests and mountains cannot be replaced.]]>

But wind is not always reliable, how can one trust and rely on the wind to generate the electricity of over seven billion people. The wind also does not blow hard enough in certain places, how does one expect the people who live in the city to receive energy rather than the people who live on the countryside, or on the mountain tops where the winds blows consistantly. The U.S. needs a reliable source of energy to power this country, and wind that only comes every so often is not reliable. Not only is the wind not reliable but who wants to have windmills and wind farms and the big, noisy turbines around to ruin the landscape. For the creation of these windills to happen, they will need to destroy the seldom wild life and nature we have left]]>

For instance, the wind turbines used to produce energy are huge and bulky structures that are unappealing to the human eye. To add to that, wind turbines are not used 24/7 it is only used when their is an actual current of wind. Their could be no energy produced at all on certain days. In case some of you haven't noticed we are in debt right now and making these turbines would require us to create new jobs for Americans. While that does seem like a good thing, it is not it creates more debt because for all the money we make from the energy it goes to the payments of the turbines, the jobs created to keep these things running, and the constant repair of damaged turbines do to lightning strikes or other natural causes. Lastly, this is not a noiseless idea it creates tremendous amounts of noise pollution. We are basically putting hundreds of small jet engines together and letting them run all at once. Now imagine how pleasant that must sound?]]>

Windmills are big ugly machines and need a lot of room so we ruin beautiful landscapes and inhabitats. Birds have to change their migration patter which has been apart of their nature for generations. These big ugly machines are not the best solutoin for clean energy and are not worth the money for such little results.]]>

For example , without wind there is no point in using wind as a source.It only blows in certain times when there is wind which isnt 24/7.Another disadvantage is the blades are very noisy , and tend to have an annoying sound.People who pass by might get irritated by the way the blades run .If you live near a windmill , you will probably have lack of sleep unless your a real heavy sleeper and does not get disturbed by noise often.Windmills are usually located on top of hills , along the shoreline , or somewhere in a high position which doesnt really create a nice view for some people. The turbines can be too big , have an ugly design , ruin a rural landscape that wont look attractive . To install a windmill there has to be clear space for it to be located at .Forests , mountains , buildings , and other man-made structures would have to be tooken away in order for a windmill to have space to be there . People enjoy nice clear views to spend time at , but with a big windmill making so much noise and not bieng attractive-looking , it wont be a nice clear view afterall for such .Even though , windmills could look harmless , they endanger wildlife , and migrating birds.The wind source disrupts the way the winds goes and can get anything that flys stuck in the blades if it happens to fly by. Another disadvantage is Wind speed varies by 10% , and turbine power varies by 25% which with wind makes less power than a turbine.]]>

It is obvious that wind turbines depend on the wind blowing, so we should consider the fact the wind may not be blowing 24/7. These turbines can also cause different types of pollution than the type of pollution we normally consider; noise disturbance to local wildlife, ruining the scenery in rural landscapes, as well as obtructing views. Wild animals that fly also become in risk of getting injured by unknowingly flying in the mills. Wind speed also varies by 10% while the turbines needed power varies by 25%; this lets us know that that the mills have a chance of not being provided with sufficient of not being able to run at all. There also is one more factor to consider, which is damage to the trubines themselves; lighting and g-force winds can both respectively damage the already exspensive and time consuming technology.]]>

Each year, wind turbines are the cause of death for thousands of birds worldwide, including some very rare migrating birds. These turbines pose a threat to endangered, as well as non-endangered birds. On top of that, the spinning of the turbines is very loud, causing a large amount of noise pollution, which isn't only annoying to people, but a problem for animals as well. Furthermore, the wind does not blow 24/7, so wind may not always be a 100% reliable source. The sheer size of the turbines also causes problems: they are not aesthetically pleasing; they require a huge amount of land for a wind farm; they can't be obstructed, thus limiting the number of available spaces for them to be placed; etc.]]>

One such disadvantage is the possible damage that could be done to the enviornment. Although using wind to generate power wouldn't produce any waste products (polluting gases, ashes, etc.), the building of the generators themselves could harm the enviornment. According to a credible source, wind turbines take up a lot of space, so natural obstructions, such as trees, would have to be removed or relocated. Another source reported that while the turbines are active, they could endanger wildlife, or more specifically, birds. Especially during migration periods, birds travel in immense flocks, and an accident wouldn't be too surprising, since the sheer number of birds would cause obstruction of vision. Not only is using wind power potentially harmful, the act would also pester human society. For example, one reliable source reported that wind turbines are simple too loud, while another wrote that they ruin rural landscape. There exist many disadvantages in prioritizing wind power over other sources of power, and the act should not be carried out.]]>

Many people feel that this phenomenon has been of great help to the american population, however there are many negative side effects to the use of Wind Energy. This source of power does not work all the time, makes too much noise and its construction affects land resources. Since this resources depends on the wind speed it is obvious that Wind Energy is not generated 24 hours a day 7 days a week. there are moments when the wind practically stops thus the power produced by Wind Energy is minimal. Also the amount of noise produced by this source of energy is unbarrable. teh blades used in this system produce a loud noise that is polluting the once calm environment in tha areas around wind farms. Those in favor of using Wind Power argue that with this new power source generates energy for a large amount of people and that the large turbines will allow even a larger amount of people to be benefited by Wind Energy without owning a wind system. However the turbines used to install the Wind Energy systems are still too big and ugly in design causing damages to the rural landscape when being installed. This also causes obstruction of many foressts, mountains and man-made structures endangering wild life and migrating birds.]]>

As late as the 1920's , Americans used small windmills to generate electricty in rural areas that lacked electric service. Over the last decade ,wind energy has become one of the most cost-effective emerging technologies. Windmill blades are likesails that turn into wind and generate energy.]]>

With the increase of electronics and new advances the is more of a need for a source that can support the amount of energy that is being used. The downfall of the windmill is the fact that there is not always wind blowing all of the time. The amount of energy that can be produces by the windmill is also inconsistant. The amount of energy varies from 10% to 25%. This energy is not nearly enough to support cities or even towns of growing communities. The age of the windmill has reached its limits.

While positively helping people get energy it is actually harming the wildlife that surrounds the turbines. It is not worth harming animals that already have trouble living in the wild to block out their homes with big machines. Although the turbines create energy they do not actually affect enough people to be used.

According to research the windmills were first used as late as the 1920s to generate electricity in rural areas tha didnt have much elecric service. The wind energy today has become one of the most cost-effective technologies which is used in areas such as the mid/western USA. This has taken over the innovative technology which has created windmills called wind farms.This energy resource like blade that turn only in the wind to generate energy (like solar pannels without blades)! As mentioned by the student, this wind flows over the blades creating the lift to make them rotate. This produces electricity and energy which is fantastic to communities. Fortunately, this source of energy is clean but because it is wind, it was less impacts for the environment unlike other sources of energy. Unfortunately, this source of energy also had disadvantages just like every other innovation. If an individual lives too close to the windmills, the blades are extremely noisy, however this power does not blow 24/7. This invention is not the mos attractive sight also; they are &quot;big, ugly design [which] ruin rural landscape.&quot; This source of energy destroys locations too like forests, mountains, building, and oher man-made structures, oh my! Sadly this puts wildlife in danger which resuls in birds having to migrate and make a new home somewhere else. This blade spinning creates pollution which can lead to the cost of lives of both human beings and animals.]]>

With having the windmills we'll be able to actually have something to make energy and be a positive effect on Earth. Like in the article it says, &quot;Wind Power does not generate pollution or radioactive waste&quot; which shows that having windmills doesn't harm our planet. Instead it helps us more green and hurt our mother nature. A lot people argue that it's not blowing 24/7 and when it does blow the blades make too much noise. Well obviously it's not going to be blowing 24/7 because wind doesn't blow forever. We would put these wind mills in the Western and Mid-Western of the United States where more winds are blown. Having noisy blades isn't much of a problem. You're not going to be living next to it, it'll be placed a not so close to your house so you wouldn't be hearing the noise. Also as time passes they'll be able to create a windmill that doesn't make much noise. Another reason why people might not want to have windmills is because it's too big or ugly. Well many of the factories or other buildings are big and ugly too and we don't complain about that. The Turbines will be helping us make energy to not play so much electricity, be more green, and avoid brown outs. Plus the windmills will be more in rural areas where not much buildings are built.]]>

It is not a very practical option due to numerous factors that could create obstacles all around the world. For example, it is not practical in seasons where there is little to no wind or places that have tall buildings like New York. Also, in places with tall trees, mountains or other tall man-made structures. And the little wind, if any, will be obstructed by the tall trees, mountains, and buildings. Wind Power is also not practical because it is too big and ruins the natural design or rural areas and lightning which happens very often in places like Florida can damage the turbines. Using wind power can also endanger wildlife like birds and can be noisy and npractical for people who do not live in big cities.]]>

The wind is also not blowing all the time which can cause an energy crisis. In the end it is up to the people to decide if these disadvantages are worth it or not.]]>

Also wind speed varies by 10% while turbine power varies by 25%. but sadly that's not the only problam with them, they also have noisy blades that you wouldn't want to hear while your going to sleep or trying to relax. If we made a lot of them in one area as we would and a lightning storm broke out because they are so tall lighting would easily strike one of them and most likely start a fire desroying not only one of the windmills but quite a few as the fire spreads. Yet another problem is the design of the turbines are huge and ugly and take up a lot of space. A lot of people wouldn't want to see them everyday let alone have them ruining rural landscape that they could put to good use. To collect all the energy we use we'd have to build a lot of them and that would mean having less beautiful landscape such as forests, mountians, and even buildings along with other man made structures. They windmill would not only destroy land but migrating birds and a lot endangered wildlife that live or oass by the area we make the windmills.]]>

If there were machines powered by wind in a factory, workers woukd not be able to attend their daily jobs and would not gain as much money as they are supposed to. Not only does the wind not blow daily but many obstacles block wind as well. Mountains and skyscrapers may block wind and not let them take path to work whatever is powered by wind.]]>

The large blades which rotate on the windmills when the wind is blowing create a lot of noise. This problem is then multiplied when there is an entire farm or group of them spread across an area. Fortunately the blades are not spinning all the time because wind does not blow all the time.... In addition to noise pollution, these large blades do not only create noise but they also impact passing birds. While the birds are flying by, there is a big chance that they will not see the blade going towards them, this creates a hazard to the birds and can potentially damage the windmill itself. Finally, the strange and out of place design of the structure. The generic windmill is a large structure with three blades rotating around the top. The structure is also painted white, a very bad choice of color compared to the background of lush mountains, hills, and plains.]]>

One of the different sources of energy they are looking more towards are wind power or windmills. In some ways they are right it helps the environment more and it is a great source of energy but people dont look at the disadvantages of having wind energy. Some of those disadvantages are that the windmill wont blow 24/7 and once the windmill stop blowing then the energy starts to get less and less. After a while of no wind the willmill wont turn and wont give out energy. Another one of these disadvantages are that the blades are way to noisy for poeple. If the windmills dont stop turning then the noise will continue on day and night, people will start to get frustruated and will want to get rid of these windmills. For people at are really attached to nature and like the free wild life and the natures of life, a disadvantages for them would be that the windmills would be endangering the wildlife such as migrating birds or any kind of birds that pass by the wind farms. These creatures wont know what is ahead and might get caught in one of the blades of even just crash into a windmill.]]>

Windmills can be annoying when they are in use. If there's not enough wind to move the blades, you wouldn't be able to make as much electricity as you would on any other day. Also, you're open to noise from the moving windmills almost in relation with a small jet engine. Since the windmill will be nearby on your property, having to hear the jet engine almost all the time can be such an annoyance. Windmills which are towering in size can be able to hurt wildlife. If a flock of birds were to fly into the blades, there would be major casualties especially if these flock of birds are endangered. Windmills being huge enough to be seen from far away, they can be obstructing views of natural landscapes. This obstruction can ruin a tourists days to find out there was a windmill blade poking into the corner of his picture of a mountain, builiding, or a forest.]]>

However, there are some disadvantages which makes the use if wind energy in the American society a troubling idea. First, there are concerns over the wind mills such as not blowing 24 hours everyday, the blades in the mills are too noisy, and the turbines are big while the design is ugly. The other concerns consists of the enivironment such as runing he rural landscape, obstructing the enivrionment as well as man made building and structures, and endangering the wildlife especially the brids who migrates. The other disadvantages are the variety of the wind speed and turbine power, damage of the turbine, and noise pollution in the wind farms. Wind energy has advantages for the enivrionment and the society, yet it has disadvantages that could turn the advantages against them. Since the use of wind enrgy means building wind farms, then that would mean that the farmers and other people who live in the rural areas will lose their homes. Wind energy is also meant to save the animals who are endangered, yet it brings more danger to the animals particularly the birds who fly through the wind mills in order to get to their locations. Wind energy means using both wind and turbine to genrate electricity, but the wind comes depending on the wheather of the wind mills' location and the power of the turbine has unpredictable changes as well as lightning damage that could also damage the environment. The use of wind energy has both advantages and disadvantages, but in the end, it all depends on how the energy is going to be used.]]>

Some of the advantages are being able to be used for grinding of wheat,corn,to pump water and wood trimming for sawmills. Back them wind power was highly used since electricity was rare. Many western and eastern parts of the united states took the advantage of the technology in wich they created wind farms. As you can see wind useage was big back in the 1920s but is it highly used know that we need to creat more wind power useage. There are also many of the disadvantages to wind power. Some of these disadvantages are that it doesnt blow 24/7, noisy blades and obstruction. If having wind power and it doesnt blow 24/7 why is it that we need it. Also have alot of wind farms close to homes and cities can cause for pedestrians and buisness to be agetated cause of the noise that the wind powers give off. This will cause for many buisnesses to move to another place or close and this will cause many money lose which will not only affect us the people but also the government. So do we really need wind power even though its not being provided to use 24/7 and can cause obstructions.]]>

Thus not as a sufficiant amount of energy can be collected. The blades of the turbines do make a lot of noise which can cause a disturbance. The turbines must be big which causes an unsightly view for the area. Wind turbines only produce rates of 10-25% power, so there needs to be many of them in one spot for it to be effective.]]>

One of them being that the wind isn't necessarily blowing 24/7 for the windmills to work all of the time. Mother nature does not always work to our advantage, there are times when the wind doesnt blow at all for months at a time, and times where it's so windy it feels like your house will blow over. Another disadvantage to having windmills is that they are always too big, they are always too noisy, they have an ugly design, and their presence ruins the rural landscape. Windmills are very noisy, they cause noise pollution, and they happen to sound like loud jet engines. Windmills are very ugly, think about it, you have this luscious green fields and hills, and then you have these giant windmills that take all of the attention away from these hills. Although windmills are a great source of energy, they are not all that reliable.]]>

They state that they will cause a noise disturbance, and will serve as a rather ugly addition to such a rural landscape at which they are built upon. Also, they will take up space where other things could be, like forests, mountains, buildings and other man-made structures.

Using wind power is free, better and easier to use and get than most energy resources we use today, but there is many disadvantages to using wind power. For example: wind may not be blowing 24/7, the blades on the windmills will be to noisy for residents living around them, it can possible endanger widlife (specifically migrading birds), and wind speed can always vary. In many parts of the United States, not many states get strong blowing wind, that are hard enough to move the gigantic windmill blades in wind farms. If wind speed isn't strong enough to push the blades around than it would be a total waste to have these there. Thats why wind speed that can vary a lot is a huge problem as well. In addition, if these huge gigantic blades do have enough power to move, it would make to much noise for the residents who live around wind farms. Not only that, but it also has a potential to ruin widlife animals such as migrating birds. These are just a few examples of way we shouldn't use wind power. Inconclusion, win power can cause a distrubince in animal wildlife, can distrub the people living around them, and can not work because wind doesn't blow 24/7 and the speed can vary. It is a good idea to help save energy and help reduce fossil fuels to the lowest that can be, but until we solve these problems, it's an idea that is not going to work.]]>

These may include the fact that these they are inconsitant and their size and design get in the way of natural habitats and endanger wildlife. Wind power can be very good at keeping pollution out of the air that people and animals breathe, but they do not provide consistan energy because of their lack of ability to blow 24/7. These windmills are made to produce wind in a way that energy will be produced. If they cannot blow 24/7, how will sufficient amount of energy be produced? Wind is not abundant in every area of the world, so even if it works great in one region where there are vast amount of wind, that doesnt mean that windmills will work great in other regions or areas. The fact that windmills may be inconsistant with teir production of energy shows that they are not the best source of energy, even though they help minimize the amount of polution in society. Another flaw would be the fact that these windmills may not entierely benefit the enviornment and its wildlife. The large and odd shape of these things cause enviornments and habitats to be cut down and so animals are forced to look for other homes which might put them in danger.

I agree with the student that windmills are not worth the time or the money that people put into their placement. They affect many birds migration patterns which causes the bird to fly into the windmill blades killing the birds. This has even killed whole flocks of birds causing too much damage to any type of species of birds. These windmills are noisy and are not very effective and sometimes depending on the wind not even work at all. This is why I agree with the student that windmills are a waste of money and resources.]]>

First of all, wind turbines create sound pollution, as the blades are very noisy. This can upset people living in areas by the wind turbines. Turbines can also be aesthetically unpleasant, and can ruin a rural landscape. Additionally, the turbines pose a threat to endangered wildlife in surrounding ecosystems. This mainly applies to bird populations that may fly through the area, and be struck by the turbines. Finally, wind power is an ineffective source of energy because it is completely reliant on the presence of wind, which can be inconsistent.]]>

Old inventions are improved or thrown away because they have not enough good use in them. Wind Energy is one example of something that must be thrown out or greatly improved upon. Wind turbines are big and quite nasty when seen on a beautiful countryside. They ruin the landscape surrounding them and create a lot of noise. Also, they aren't very efficient. Many other sources of energy can run all the time providing lots more reliable energy for the homes of America while the turbines don't run 24/7. On the environmental standpoint wind turbines can cause a shift in the migration of birds and effect the habitat of endangered wildlife. Without looking at many important facts, Wind Energy can seem like a very logical use of area and labor, unfortunatley with their poor design, loud obstucting blades, and negative effect on surrounding wildlife: they are not the solution to America's energy.]]>

People say that with the development of this new technology the usage of energy sources such as coal and mine can decrease. However, wind energy has its flaws. Firstly, wind energy cannot be the sole source of energy because it is not dependable. Wind is not blowing all the time which means that when the wind stops, which is often, energy will not be available. This also leads to a meriod of variation in regards to the power that is produced causing a very risky situation. Wind energy can also decrease the quality of life by causing niose pollution due to the niosy blades, and obstructing scenery such as forests, mountains, buildings and other man-made structures.

Windmills do not create pollution or produce radioactivce waste, but did you ever stop to think about all of the pollution and waste caused by making these massive structures? Windmills are massive structures assembled by manmade machines and vehicles, which tragically produce pollution into clean countryside air considering that most windmills are located in country regions. Once assembled they continue to harm country regions with their noise pollution, scaring animals and disturbing residents. These massive spinning structures also endanger wildlife, such as migrating birds. Lastly, they aren't even that efficient; wind speed varies by 10%, while turbine power varies by 25%. Clearly, windmills are not as good a source of energy for us as they are commonly made out to be.]]>

WIndmills are only fully efficient when wind is blowing on them constantly. But in many rural areas, wind is not consistently blowing and making the windmills rotate, therefore they are not the most efficient way to provide power. And even when there is wind blowing on the blades, it is very noisy and causes a lot of noise pollution to areas surrounding the wind farms. This noise can bother the environment around it and can be a significant strain. Windmills can also hurt animals, especially birds. When birds migrate, they usually migrate in big flocks. And if the entire flock enters through a wind farm, then that entire group could get hurt or even killed. Although wind power is one of the cheapest and most resourceful ways of providing people with power, its efficiency does not compare to other ways of generating power.]]>

Over the last decade, wind energy has become one of the most cost-effective emerging technologies. Wind is a clean source of energy, and overall, the use of wind for energy has fewer environmental impacts than using many other energy sources. Wind power is free and in abundance in certain areas especially where wind speeds are always higher such as on the shoreline, at the top of a hill,and in places free of obstruction. Wind Power can generate enough energy for all the people in town and wind turbines generated about 12 million households in the United States.

These disadvantages include fluctuationin in wind speed, if it is even blowing, public disturbance and endangering the wildlife in the area. The use of wind energy pales in comparison to the uses of solar or water based energy. This is because wind is inconsistant and unpridictable. The sun will always shine, on an exact schedule, water always flows, but does wind always blow? No, it doesn't. So if we rely to much on wind energy and suddenly there isnt any wind for a while, what then? Even if there is wind, what if there isnt enough to supply the needed electricity, or even turn the blades? The reliability of wind energy needs to be taken into account when trying to discern its worth. Another issue comonly faced with windmills is that there arent safe for wild life. Birds in the area of a wind farm would have a high chance of being hit by a blade, because they dont understand the concept. To add to that when birds migrate in large groups, entire sections of a flock could be killed. Beyond the fact that we are taking mass amounts of land from these animals with the wind farms, they are just dangerous. Plus we arent just taking the land that the farm takes up directly, but an enourmous amount of surrounding land won't be happily occupied by man or animal do to the sound. A wind farm generates sound equivilent a small jet, probably terrifying animals and annoying people into leaving. All aound wnd energy just isnt a safe, consistant source of energy.]]>

If there were any natural disasters they would be the first to go and fall which could cause huge damage and maybe even death if it lands on the house. Wind Power is great for large hills or flat areas but we cannot make them anymore useful in other areas. They also would be very difficult to fix of something went wrong with them.]]>

Food is more important than engergy. Also birds can become endarngered if enough of them are killed by the blades, espcailly if they put the turbines in the forests or moutains where there is a lot of wild life. Lastly wind turbines are to big and take up to much land which is why it ruins rural landscape. Overall wind turbines are ruining our land and wildlife.]]>

They do not make energy 24/7 due to there not being wind 24/7. They would also need to find a place where there was more than a 10% wind speed that would make it more profitable. At a 10% wind speed the turbine power varies by 25%. How is that going to help in the skyrocketing electricity bills in the 21st century. It's not going to help much. It also affects the nature in the surrouding areas. They are noisy, ugly and are obstructons to everything around them, such as moutains, buildings, or forests. Wildlife endagerment is also a flaw to this energy saving plan. An animal could get hurt by the blades moving through their paths.

Another reason why wind power can be sustainde is if a power grid is created, which would mean that you wouldn't necesarily need to own a wind mill where you lived, that would also mean that they wouldn't be an obstruction.

It does not blow every hour of the day, which doesn't support 100% of the energy being used. Windmill blades are also very noisy and loud which can implement problems to nearby communities. Wind energy sources also endanger wildlife by sending wrong wind patterns or directions that make birds believe the direction of the windmill is their migration route. The wind speed also varies by 10% and the turbine power varies by 25%, which is a problem because power shouldn't have to overpower speed. Speed creates power, so if it doesn't, there wouldn't be any point in using wind as an energy source. Besides the inside sources in which makes the windmill work, the outside features gives it also a disadvantage because it is a big and not preferable design. In which most cases, ruin the rural landscape.]]>

For example the wind does not blow 24/7 and that can be a probem especially in the summer where the summer breeze is felt for a slight second and not felt withen the next week or so. The speed is of the wind is another factor towards this down side of the wind energy. The speed of the wind is important as to calculating how much wind power will be produce for the household that will need this electricity. Also if the wind is moving at a rapid pace the windmill could break leaving the household totally in the darkness with no power. The endangered wildlife could have no where to go beacuse the windmills will be placed in the area of the living creature and causing it to move somewhere when it can adapt to the environment causing it it's demise. Are fying friends woud be blown away because of the wind being created by the mills also making them move somewhere were they must adapt or fly off to some place far away where they can survive. The windmills must be placed where it can't disturb anything ike a dessert or very cose to one. They must be in well condition and must have a repairman of some sort having a check on them and knowing wether or not will be abe to make through a rough wind storm. That wi be the best spot for these windmill and not causing trouble.]]>

It would also endager many life forms that have come to be admired by all in addition to ruining a beuatiful landscape. I believe that using windmills as energy sources would result in many problems throughout the nation. Windmills do not blow all day. Some families might need energy and light to accomplish the things that are necessary for everyday life. Many high school and college students are staying up after sunset and they need light and energy to complete their tasks. A windmill cannot create enough power for all students who need excess energy. Many people have come to love their countryside landscapes, but that is where a windmill would be placed. To have enough energy for the United States it would require a vast amount of windmills. The number of windmills would cover the beauty of a lanscape. The power that we attain at this moment suits us well and there has been no need to change how we gain our energy. The windmills are not necessary and do not need to be attained as a new energy source. It would only change how the United States feels about themselves and the way that they use power.]]>

Another factor that needs to be considered is the possibility of engangering wild life or migrating birds. These helpless animals absentmindedly fly straight into these treachorous blades and are killed. This posseses a great worry within the community as well as animal activists. There is also the fact that these blades are designed with an immense structure and the designs of these windmills can be terribly unattractive.

He first uses the historical background of wind energy by including how it worked and how it was more reliable than other sources. He then the good things that come out of using it, the student does a great job of comparing it. To finish the editorial off he uses a plethora of statistics to bring about more information to get the ready to completley understand why wind energy would be a better option. From the students editorial I have noticed the student does not add anything about a down side, only the positives. With everything there comes good and bad, so i would say that they're are better options then wind energy for different things. Sure, you can use wind energy for windmills and such but to operate a car sounds a bit ridiculous and unreliable. Over the decades our world keeps finding out about more and more ways and reasons to better our environment. We need to realize that one solution isn't going to fix everything, we have tried that before and we need to be smart enough to learn from our mistakes. All in all our world has an abundance amount of energy sources and we shouldn't just focus on one, wind energy, and waste our time. Our world needs to think bigger, not just today but the future. To focus on the sources that are more reliable and we have a good knowledge on, it doesn't seem like we are like that for wind yet.]]>

In order for the wind power blades to generate you need wind. Wind is not always blowing 24/7 so the blades will not be rotating all the time like we need them to. Even if the wind is blowing that does not mean that it is blowing hard enough to activate or move the windmill blade. If the world were to use the wind power generators everywhere then the sound of the blades will be a problem and disturb neighborhoods. The turbines of the windmills are huge and ugly, it will make a town look unreal, noisy, and unorthadox. In order to bulid and place the turbines anywhere you need space, this means that we would have to destroy the nature and cut down trees and many natural enviroments to create the ugly turbines. All these reasons support the disadvantages of having a windmill.]]>

Wind is not availible every single day, and when there is no wind when situations become dire, then energy is non-existent. Strong dependability is a bad idea in general in life; depending upon some ugly, loud, and huge landscape mark that isn't even guarunteed to work on any given day is horrible thinking. Windmills aren't convient in placing or building. It also doesn't truly help nature at all. Yes, by using wind, it lessens it's effect on the enviroment, but endangering species and taking their natural habitats doesn't help nature at all. Energy is a necessity and integral part of everyday life. When the wind stops blowing, daily life is affected. People will not stand to be dependent on windmills if it means they have to adjust their lives to when the wind blows. The contraption ruins the natural breath-taking beauty of the landscape, it is unbelivebly loud, and it's efficency is also based on not just the wind, but the turbines. Turbine power varies by twenty-five percent; wind speed by ten percent. Even in a world where wind does blow strong enough to produce some kind of energy everyday, it's still not guarunteeable that the effciency meets the minimum. With huge metal structures, man can't simply place these windmills where ever he wishes. When he does find areas suitable, natural habitats of species are destroyed and migrating birds are also endangered. Advocating a lesser impact on the enviroment is a strong point, unless that point attacks the enviroment in a diffrent way.]]>

First, wind is not a reliable source of energy, it never blows for a whole year straight. The design for most turbines today are, without a doubt, going out of business. The two most reliable alternative natural energy sources in the world are solar and nuclear power. With a nuclear the risks are obvious, but for the most part it may soon replace oil. As will solar power unless people live in a place where its cloudy year round.]]>

Sometimes you will not be able to cool off. Also, it has noisy blades, so sometimes when you just want to relax and have peace and quiet you won't be able to because the blades are too noisy. Next, the turbines are too big, which means it can be dangerous at times for children. Finally, it can cause turbine lightning damamge which can leave you with a poweroutage.]]>

Sometimes they don't run 24/7 due to the amount of wind that blows. There mostly located on upper parts of A mountain. Wind mills before were used to grind wheat and corn, but now there used for an energy source because it shortens the use of other environmental impacts of energy sources. They shouldn't be put next to a electricity pole which can possibly cause a lighting damage or an electricity damage for all the electricity to be out. The design of the wind mills shouldn't be a concern because there not put up to beautify a place there put up for a use of energy by wind. They also should be small not to small maybe in between so they don't attract birds or any sort of animal to a point which can harm one. The noise of the wind mill should not be heard because what if a wind mill is put next to or close to a house up on a hill then the people living in the house may be disturbed by the noise level of the wind mill, but it can be a disturbance no matter where the wind mill is put up at.]]>

ANd the engergy that they produce is not nearly sufficient for use. with only about a 25% energy output, its no wonder we dont have these in our backyards. Windmills are not reliable. They do not suply the energy needd to run a city, or power up a black out. In the long run, they cost more then they earn. reparing windmills cost a fortune. Its hardly worth the time if its such an eyesore in the first place. Since the blades are not silent, it constantly causes a disruption to anyone in its vacinity. With all its faults it hardly seems like a worth investment, compared to all the other options we have to suply our citys with sufficient energy.]]>

Our scientists are only going to build and make better windmils in the future thta will only be cheaper and more eficiant. Once put in they will go and create energy as long as there is wind or some force that is making the windmill rotate. windlmills do not create any sorte of waste wich other types of energies do such as nuclear energy wich produces nuclear waste wich stays in the evirement for years apon years. Oil creates greenhouse gasses wich are causeing global warming. they may not create alot of energy only being depenndent on wind but they do create enough that when there is an emergency everybody can tap into that energy so the town is never in the dark and will always have some form of nergy avalible. The cons to windmills are that after somebody builds them and puts them in an area the area that they are put into has to have a good amount of wind to make them worthwhile to have otherwize if they are put into a place that doesnt have alot of wind they wont create much energy at all. if windmills do not have general mantenance on them thye can not be working to there full potential or could get rusty and then be a saftly hasard if there is anybody else around in the area, once they get rusty they have a higher chance of falling over.]]>

The areas chosen for these wind mills to be constructed on will only be burdened with the eye sore that is these turbines. It could also be possible for the turbines to end up disturbing wildlife and their homes. The other statement that I agree with would be constant fluxuations of wind that it meant to be powering these turbines. It should'nt be ignored that the wind is stronger some days, and others not so much. With these fluxuations of wind, it gives the country an unstable amount of energy being produced. So there is no guarantee that these turbines would be able to constantly produce the amount of energy that its supporters would hope they could.]]>

Many areas in the western and mid-west united states have taken advantage of tghis technology bycreating large collections of windmills called wind farms.Windmill blades are like sails that turn in the wind and generate energy. wind becomes the sole source of power during times when the electrical grid is out, especially when enduring hurricans, power outages,or brown outs. wind power can generate enough energy for large number of people. in 2012, wind turbines in the united states generated about 3% of total u.s electrical or the equivalent of about 12 million households. with new technology, the cost of residential wind power turbines has decreased over 60% since the 1980's while their efficiency has increased.]]>

By having more turbines connected to the electrical grid, it could save you money, and allow for the large white turbine, to be off of your property. It may be thought that these are big and ugly, but if it was saving you money and helping the planet, I think that more and more people would use it. The wind farms created, are noisey and very powerful, as I know from experience driving from Southern California to Las Vegas, Nevada, and passing that giant wind farm, but to think that those turbines are potentially providing me, or could save me money in the future, gives me a positive look on the future of the wind turbine.]]>

My grandparents live in the high dessert where there are a lot of wind farms and they are really noisy, to the point where their house is one to two miles away from the nearist wind farm and we can hear the turbines. Secondly there isn't a lot of places where there is just a big open field with no obstructions. there is always mountains, hills, trees, or some building or structure. Also what about birds when they migrate? I concede that most birds are smart enough to stay away from big noisy fans, but there are birds that aren't as smart and they can get killed if they get sucked into the blades. Lightning is also a concern, they build some of the windmills out of metal and if the turbines are creating electricity then lightning is more likely to strike at them. My final arguement is that wind is not blowing 24/7 and when it does blow it doesn't blow at the same speed all the time.]]>

The muffling of the wind blades spinning can cause some noise when they do move make a buffetting as it chops the air. As the advance of technolgogy continues turbines, being tall and big as they are, may be able to of smaller size and generate more electricity since wind speed is varied by 10% while the power generated is 25%. Smaller ones can be less of a cost with continual use and minor fixing. Wind turbines do make the rural landscape less enjoyable even though the towereing turbines are made to be sleak and future like. Also it adds to the ever growing list of obstructions that block the a scenic view of travelers. Another reason would be the endangerment of wildlife, such as birds who tend to flock or migrate to another place. Lightning presents an even greater threat, for it could overload the wind turbine and cause it to malfunction and quite possibly explode causing a damaging amount of costs to replace the engine entirely. Noise pollution is generated from wind turbines. Even one can cause such noise as desribed above. It causes a buffetting sound of chopped air while the engine itself, comprised of a small jet engine, would have a higher mechanical sound. Even though there are many disadvantages, wind turbines are nessacary to generate clean, sustainable, and partially free energy. Excluding the cost of building and maintainance.]]>

It's reliability is compromised when there is little to no wind blowing and isn't always capable of providing energy 24/7. The noisy blades and haggard appearance can become an annoyance, especially to those cultivitating or living in rural areas that are being taken up by these windmills. It can obstruct land, cost too much maintenance, and can block natural and man made habitats such as forests, mountains, or buildings. The amount of variation characterizing the speed and turbine of the wind makes it unpredictable as to when it's going to productive or slow down energy. The obstruction of land and space can endanger some wildlife including migrating birds, forest dwellers, and other nearby organisms. The cost of insullating and relying on Wind Power is too heavy for the outcome. Natural disasters such as lightning, storm, or pouring rain may easily compromise a windmill's integrity. The small jet engine enpowering the windmill may not be able to withstand heavy measures. The possible risks will far outweigh the benefits, electric or solar energy may be the only reliable source.]]>

So putting this turbines or even creating them is not a very bright idea since the wind doesnt blow 24/7. And also there isnt much wind in some parts of the United States.]]>

Wind power is far too inconsistent to be a promising form of energy. Wind doesn't blow for the entire day, so wind turbines are not making power for the entire day. In addition wind power often varies. It is known to vary by about 10 percent. At this var ience, the turbine would be down to only 75 percent of its maximun power. The technology to make wind power also puts a fa r too heavy strain on the enviornment.Turbines are known to suck in flying birds and are responsible for thousands of b ird deaths each year.

Wind is not something that has a constant flow, sometimes the wind is not as strong or is not there at all; this makes wind power unreliable. Another disadvantage is the effort it takes to find a good place, free of obstructions to build the wind turbines- there are often trees and buildings that interfere with the wind. The idea is that wind energy is a better source of energy for the enviroment- however, while it does lead to less pollution, the wind turbines may be a danger to the flying wildlife. Wind energy is a good alternative to the fossil fuels that pollute the enviroment, however they do have their own disadvantages and flaws.]]>

Characteristics of wind turbines that cannot be prevented such as noisy blades and their ugly appearance ruin the serenity of the area that they are placed and also serve as a vsual eye sore to the surrounding community. In addition, the fact that they cannot operate 24/7 due to the nature of wind means that there is a large portion of thir time where they are doing nothing but consumng space and serving as a potential hazard. Their extremely large size also makes them vurlnable to lightining strikes and con cost more money that they are woerth depending on the extent of the damge done to them if they are hit by lightining. With the amount of serious downsides cmopared to the meager amount of energy wind turbines can prodice, it is safe to say that they are not worth the risk. In addition to their flawed funcuonality they aslo pose a major threat to natural wildlife sich as igrating birds, that are not accustomed to such onjects in their path. Non ntural objects such as wind turbines placed in the routes of mirgrating birds can serve as a terrile disaster, seerating tons of birs and lowering the overall population. They also generate a large amount of oice polution as they sounds like small jet egines going off to the neighboring area. Just how airportss have devauled property due the the noise that planes generate landing and taking off, these wind tubrines would do the expact same thing to wherever they are w=placed, which is unfair to people already licing there/ The effeciency of these turbines can also be greatly reduced eebey natural objects such as mountains or forests which greatly stop wind from reaching certain areas. The possibility of certain wind turbines receiving little to now wind and rendering them useless only to server as an eye sore and be a potential hazard in the case of a storm makes the idea of wind turbines highly unappealing.]]>

But sadly wind doesn't blow 24 hour 7 days a week. Wind tends to decrease at night so it wouldn't be able to keep producing as much for the people in a different time zone then where the wind mills are and wind speed varies by 10%-turbine power varies by 25%. Basicly when the wind is blowing it might not be enough to produce the amount that we need. A major downside is that if we were to make more wind mills we'll have destroy forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures, and isn't the whole point of using wind power to produce energy for the buildings that we do have? With more wind mills we would be putting more wildlife and migrating birds endangered. We the people will be responsible for the countless life of innocent anamials that were simply in the wrong place, at the wrong time.If we were to be making or using more wind mills we wouldn't be making enough powers because wind doesn't blow all day, we would have to destory forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures, along side putting innocent wildlife and migrating birds at risk.

To preserve earth, we must lean towards clean reuseable energy sources such as wind energy. The advatanges that come along with using wind energy is its free and abudant in places where their are high winds. Also wind energy does not generate pollution or any non renewable items such as coal, gas, or oil to power it. In the case of natural disasters, wind enegery will take the place of electrity when the electrity power begins to decline. In fact, in the year of 2012 wind energy powered 3% of us households. If we create windmill plant sites all over the world, that number will nearly double. The pollution rate will have a major decrease and it will also create new job opportunities and more money flowing throughout or economy. Also being that wing energy is free and not cost effective, it will allow the government to spend money on other major problems that need to be tended to. The impact of using windmills to generate energy is a great way to preserve earth and our economy. It is a widespread of positives waiting to happen.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Windmills provide an excellent source of energy for our country, and helps us save money too. Wind power can also be annoying due to the disadvantages of wind energy. They are also beneficial in many ways. From my point of view everyone in the United States should have a Solar system in case of an emergency, like if the power shuts down. Who knew that wind could do so much, when many think it's noisy and cold. With out any wind then the windmill can't function. I mean everyone should recognize the importance of wind. From my perspective, our house has a windmill and it produces energy. Of course it will not be turning 24/7 but it gets pretty much energy. A windmill is a benefit everyone should know about.]]>

Although wind is a never ending source of energy, winds strong enought to blow these turbines dont blow 24/7. Winds may be stopped by obstructions such as forest, mountains, buildings and other man made structures. With the advancements in this time era it may be likely that soon enough there will be way too many obstructions causing the winds to not reach the turbines with full effect. As for wind speeds vary by 10% and the turbine power varies by 25%, already not reaching its full potential. In addition, due to its massive size, these windmill's can be very dangerous. The huge design of this windmill can be very dangerous in the aspects of something going terribly wrong. For one, turbine lightning may occur. Not only is that one turbine going to malfunction, but what if it were to fall and hit another one, then that one were to hit the one next to it and so forth. Anything around the turbine may be destroyed as well as anyone getting hurt or killed. And because these things are so big, obviously the noise it generates is gonna be far greater. People around these windmills may even hear these very loud noises from their own home 24/7 for the mill's are left on all the time. These turbines are made to be enviormentally friendly and to produce energy without any damage to the ecosystem. But while saving the enviorment, the windmill's themselves are beginning to destroy it. Their large sized portions are placed in rural landscape such as mountain tops or desert fields. Thus, in order for them to be placed, the land they are taking up, as well as the animals must be cleaned out to meet the needs of these huge machines; destroying the landscape. Not only do the animals face danger before the construction, but these huge turbines effect the animals after the placements as well. Migrating birds often times may have to travel across the turbines when they're at high speeds, causing the birds to be hit by the very machine that was supposed to help their enviorment.]]>

Wind power has plenty of pros, but it does have it's disadvantages. The obstructions of the windmills that are quite big, would have to be on mountains, forests, buildings and other man-made structures. If they were to be placed in mountains or in forests the windmills could endanger the wildlife that was around where they placed the windmills. It would scare away certain animals like deer or it could really scare away the migrating birds that try to pass by where the windmills are, no bird would try to pass through the huge and noisy blades. As for the windmills that would try to be placed on buildings or other man-made structures, it's just ridiculous. They would be way too big for them to be on a building and it would most definitely ruin the rural landscape. Also, if they were to make more buildings it would be a high cost and making new buildings would mean knocking down the habitats of some animals.]]>

Let me tell you why . First of all , these areas have there own set of species who know to survive on thier own . These obstructions dont need the wind energy to make it a diffrence in the forest the climax is refreshing and there are many trees which gives us clean oxygen to breathe . On top of these huge mountains wind energy isnt needed because it is a cold area covered in snow , humans wont live there, and by adding more wind to it , it makes the weather more intence. Buildings dont necessarly need any type of wind power , its just useful and helpful to us such as living under a roof top , jobs , clinics , schools etc. If it gets hot during some point of the day then we turn on the air conditioner to make it cool. Yes opening the windows would be a great idea that you can do but the feeling of the cold a.c blowing is satisfying . Working in Man-made structures is a tuff job beacuse you get tired easily and you realese so much energy in one day. But, manifacturing things that are really huge are usually outside just an example of the statue of liberty . Your hours of hours outside but because your a certain level above the ground when the wind blows you feel it more than if you were to be on the ground. Wind energy isnt really needed, our envirement provides it for us already . For the wind to not blow 24/7 isnt really a big deal. I understand that it sometimes gets frustrating when its hot but thats ok , theres always a way to fix it. Going to the beach , a lake would be a clever thing to do . Some of you may say well &quot; what if i dont have a ride&quot; theres always a pool , invite some friends over and youll forget about the weather . We dont even need the wind to be blowing every second , think about it say you go out to a fiest weather your a boy or a girl and you have your hair done you wouldnt want the wind to mess up your hair, or if your playing a sport you wouldnt want the ball going to a diffrent direction . The endagered of wildlife and migrating species doesnt have much to do with this wind energy . If an animal cant adapt to were its living then they move to another area . It's called survival of the fittest . There are many diffrent kinds of species that produce themselfes every year . Well that concludes my reason of the disadvantages of wind energy.]]>

Also known as Wind Power, it can generate enough energy for a large amount of people in different areas. In 2012, the United States wind turbines generated about 3% of total U.S. electricity of about 12 million household. Even though windmills were used to generate electricity decades ago, like in 1920 Americans used small windmills to generate electricity in rural areas that lacked electricity, todays windmills are much more advanced. With new technology, the cost of residential wind power turbines has decreased over choice to pay more for electricity that comes from renewable sources to support new technologies. Growth in wind power has been encouraged by tax breaks for renewable energy. However, Wind Power is free and in abundance in certain areas especially where wind speed are always higher such as on a shore line. Wind is an excellent supplement to other renewable resources such as solar and hyroelectric power, but it does not generate pollution or radioactive waste. It also does not consume any of the non-renewable resources such as caol, natural gas, or oil. Although, it is the sole source of power during times when the electrical grid is out, mainly when enduring hurricanes, power outages, or brown outs. Overall, wind is a clean source of energy, the use of wind for energy has fewer enviromental impacts than using many other energy sources. Even though it may only be used for one major effect, it is a great reliable source for this effect.]]>

If a town relied only on energy from a windmill, how would it manage itself when there is no wind? Wind doesn't blow every single hour of the day. Windmills are a sufficient source of energy, but it also endangers wild life and ruins rural landscapes. Since windmills are elevated, birds are endangered because they fly straight into it. Not only are windmills tall, they also happen to be big in size as well. Actually, they're too big to where they ruin landscapes by taking space and by just being an ugly design. The blades are the size of airplane wings. This adds on too the annoying noises it makes. The wing noises prevent the people from sleeping at and distract when working.]]>

Windmills are seen from afar and while driving, however, they have an ugly design, they are too big, and can ruin the look of rural landscape. Wind power objects are seen as an obstruction to forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. Although wind power is very effective, the wind speed can vary about 10% and the turbine power can vary 25%. These windmills have been endangering wildlife and birds who are migrating. During severe weather, there is possibility of turbing lightning damage. Lastly, wind power creates noise pollution on wind farms with small jet engines.]]>

Itsays that the windmills dont blow 24/7 maybe because there isnt wind. What are we going to do when is summer time theres harly any wind how are we supposed to have energy. The blades are nois we really dont like noisy things how are we supposed to relax when there are noisy blades. The blades can be danger for the birds as well as for annything that flies.

The design of the windmills does not matter, what matters is that us humans will be getting energy by a better way.

The wind turbines also creat an obsturuction to forests, mountains, buildings, and other man made structures. These wind powered turbines are not a very reliable source of energy. They are not blowing 24/7 witch means they are not producing alot of energy throught the corse of one day.

While changing to wind energy it will give a boost to society to &quot;go green&quot;, therefoe mkain the environmen more apealing. Yes there are disadvantagese of wind energy, such as: no having a 24 hour wind, the blades beeing noisy, and obstrucing landscapes.

Wind is something that will always be there and if nature is doing us the favor of giving us a resource that we can and have been using it who are we to stop from using it. So much of the things we use cause lasting effects to the enviorment which will eventually end up effecting us by using wind power no pollution or radioactive waste will occur. A reasonable compromise would be to only install the wind mills in the peaks of where most wind occurs therefore not distracting or desturbing the landscapes as much and benefiting all of us.]]>

Another problem is that the air isnt always blowing hard 24/7 so we wont be getting as much energy as we get right now, but we wont need to use any oil, coal or natural gas that damages our eco system. We would also have to chop down a lot of trees t make space for the windmills and that would mean less homes for he birds to live in wich can lead to their extinction.]]>

Wind energy is an extreme danger to endangered wildlife, especially migrating birds. Many birds need to fly to another environment for a season to have a better sustainable life, and they cannot do so if many windmills are in the way of their flight path. This is very likely, and there have been many incidents where birds get stuck in the windmill. Wind power is also an obstruction to forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. Since many windmills are needed to generate enough power, area is cleared to make room for them. Windmills take up a lot of room and is therefore not sustainable if area needs to be cleared for it.]]>

One of the thing that he said that might be most helpful is, &quot; that the wind power can gernerate enough energy for larg numbers of people. In 2012, wind turbines in the united staes generated about 3% of the total U.S. population&quot;. just by him stating that that should give people things to think about even if your not into wind turbines and other things like that. In california its not as windy as it will be in manny other places like chicago. But if you was to ignore something like this and your a crop person and you are growing vegetables like corn that doesn't grow well in chilly temperatures theey might even be able to get nocked over by the winds if there strong enough to do so. Also other people that should be into the wind stuff are the astronamers. And see what and how things are going in space like... we never know the strong winds they be happening may be a result of things in space and maybe winds might be dangerouse int the fututre we will never know unless we put people to start thinking of the thins that need to be tooken care of. wind speeds in deserts are about as high as they can be in california like thats why we are having more and more wind storms and sand storms.]]>

Some reasons include the fact that there is not wind blowing 24/7 which means they are not always effective. Those who have to live near the windmills also have to deal with the noise caused by the blades. On top of all those issues windmills are very ugly and ruin rural landscapes and obstruct nature. They destroy forests, mountains have to be damaged to build them and other man made structures can be in the way or obstructed. With nature being obstucted so is wild life and their habitats.]]>

For example, wind does not blow all the time, which means that wind power will not be sufficient to generate enough energy for everyone. Some may argue that larger turbines would solve this problem; however, their ugly design will ruin the rural landscape, and the noisy blades can also disturb residents. In addition to the aesthetic disadvantages of turbines, there are also many obstructions to building such structures such as forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. Another supposed advantage of wind power is its efficiency and its ability to be environmentally friendly. However, wind speeds vary by 10% and turbine power varies by 25%, proving that this efficiency is not consistent or stable enough to warrant widespread use of wind power. In addition, there are also many environmental hazards to wind power. For example, the large turbines can threaten endangered wildlife and endanger migrating birds. In addition, turbines may succumb to lightning damage, requiring maintenance costs. Finally, the turbines may also contribute to noise pollution. Thus, while wind energy may seem beneficial in theory, in practice it is not a plausible source of energy.]]>

I feel that it would be a good idea to start replacing these bad environmental things for cost efficent and clean, waste-free energy sources. Putting in multiple windmills would not be a bad thing, clearing the room for them could do some damage if you aren't careful. They would be noise-free, good for the environment; even though it doesn't generate power as fast; with the time they will eventually be the perfect thing needed to produce the energy, and they would not be ugly to put in if you place them in spots where they won't be seen by the public but will have the best outcomes for societies and be a better idea then putting pollutants or more waste on our Earth that isn't necessary.]]>

But there are many things that could obstruct the nature of people and animals and having a constant flow of energy such as; the wind not blowing 24/7, noise pollution, could potentially endanger migrating wild life (ie. birds), and much more. Instead of just looking at just having practically free energy many should also consider the following: As people know, the wind is not blowing perfusly constantly, yes, there may be a breeze all day in some parts but would that really be enough to move the big turbine blades? The margin for error is too wide to just hope that wind will blow all day long and have it be strong enough to actually move the turbines. Without that constant wind, power could be lost for who knows how long, cities could go without power for days maybe even weeks. Windmill's are a wonderful source of power, but it would not be logical to rely on it completely and throw out the standard means of electricity. These turbines that are used would be tromendously loud, it would be similar to having a field full of small jet engine's going all day long. This would disturb the peace of those living remotly close to the wind farms. Not only would it disturb the peace but put migrating birds at risk of getting harmed. The populations of birds could and most likely would fly into these propellors (practically) and could run the risk of endargerment of an entire important species. This means of clean energy should be looked into a bit closer before being applied.]]>

Wind does not blow the whole 24 hours in a day, meaning that the turbines will not be getting constant electricity. Also the blade may be loose or squeaky which would cause un-pleasant noises for the people near the windmills. The desigh of the turbines can be very large and clunky. They aren't much to look at and aren't appealing to rural areas. It obstructs the view of a natural look. They ruin the look of possibly beautiful landscapes. In order to build a windmill, people may have to cut down trees which could leave endangered wildlife without a home. Since the turbines are so tall and usually built on hills or mountains they tend to get struck by lightening and could be costly to repair.]]>

When creating wind mills, workers need to clear a big patch of land to create enough wind mills to be effective, and to make sure that location has enough wind to rotate the blades. The workers are obstructing forests and mountains, rural places, and other man made structures. By destroying the forests, more damage is done becasuse trees are a source of oxygen and fresh air. They provide us the air we need to breath in order to live. And although wind power is powerful and useful, energy only leads to pollution which can only harm to world. Though people think wind mills actually help this planet, in the end, more areas of land are destructed and more pollution has entered the earth.]]>

American colonist used wind mills to grind wheat and corn, to pump water, and to cut wood at saw mills. The wind mills did not blow 24/7 it had an effect like airplane wings, wind flows over the blades creating lift and causing them to rotate. Windmill are like sails that turn in the wind and gernerate energy. The downfall about the windmills is the noisy blades they are most likely really annoying. The blades connect to a drive shaft that turns an electric generator to produce electricity, and wind is a clean source of energy, and overall, the use of wind for energy has fewer environmental impacts than using many other sources. The turbines are too big, and have an ugly design, but the worst part about these windmills is that the turbines ruin rural landscape. The authors point that he is coming across is why have windmills when they cause so many problems they are ruin our envirnoment and there not always blowing wind the wind speed varies by 10% and turbine power varies by 25%. The turbines also cause noise pollution, wind farms, and we use small jet engines. We have endagered wildlife, and migrating birds nothing at all comes even successful out of these turbines we are waisting are money on and effecting our things around us that we do not see with our own eyes so the author is explaining to americans we need to stop this and make a change.]]>

First, if you don't live in a windy area then you won't be getting electicity and even if you do the wind isn't going to blow forever. There will be days where the wind doesn't blow at all and you will be stuck with no power. Another thing is that the turbines are really big and ruin the landscape. Imagine the fields with multiple turbines, it would'nt be really romantic now would it? It wouldn't also be getting the most power of air. With forests, mountians, buildings and other manmade structures these can get in the way of trying to gain power. Also you need a lot of wind to power a big turbine for electricity becasue a little breeze is not going to cut it. Plus the electricity is not produced by the turbine varies from by 25%. So the need for a lot turbines is curcial. With more turbines also cause another issue, which is the endangerment of wildlife and migrating birds. Blades can phyiscally hit the birds and cause damage to these birds. Also the turbines take space on the ground which could have been homes for wildlife.]]>

Imagine walking through a peaceful forrest with your partner and admiring nature's beauty. Now imagine turning a corner and seeing a huge, ugly, metal wind turbine right in the middle of a daisy field. Instead of running through and enjoying the field, you stand disgusted by the loud machine. For reasons like these, wind turbines are not a good solution. Nature is supposed to remain untouched.

We're so use to our lights turning on as soon as we move the light switch. The windmill is NOT blowing 24/7 which means your electricity relys on the weather.What if it is not windy some nights? You would have to go with out light, the blades that are attached to the windmill are very noisy. Not only might there be an absence of light in your home, but you are also endangering wildlife! Migrating birds might crash with the windmill. It also come with the disadvantage of noise pollution thanks to the blades attached to the windmill.]]>

For one, unlike regular energy wind energy is not available 24 hours a day! Just imagine if a city only ran on wind power. What if a pregnant women surrounded by para-palegic patients are on an elevator at 2 in the morning? For one the elevator would be stuck and there would be no working phone lines to contact authorities. So as a result there would be a women be giving birth in the midst of unconscious and possibly deceased paa-palegic patients! Also these wind tubines look about as aeshetically pleasing as the behind of a donkey! If one were to enter a supposedly &quot;modern&quot; urban city, they would immediately turn back and go to whatever primitive village they came from at the sight of these big hulking and ugly turbines! It's no doubt windpower is a bad choice for energy and nuclear power is the way to go!]]>

Wind turbines are believed to have minimal environmental impact because they don't produce waste, don't create pollution or radioactive waste, and they don't consume non-renewable resources like coal or oil. Even though they are believed to have no negative environmental effects, this is simply not true. The blades on wind turbines are incredibly noisy, and create large amounts of noise pollution. This noise pollution disrupts the surrounding environment and can cause wildlife to migrate away from the area. This noise pollution disrupts the balance in the ecosystem. Besides causing animals to move away from the area, wind turbines can also endanger the wildlife directly. Often times birds will be flying and be struck by the enormous blades. The blades cause a real danger to migrating birds and can kill them in large amounts. The noise pollution created by wind turbines, and the danger they pose to wildlife are two ways that wind turbines are not as useful of an energy source as people believe. Besides being a danger to the surrounding ecosystems and wildlife, wind turbine farms ruin rural landscapes. Wind farms must be placed in open, unindustrialized areas to catch the most wind and be the most productive. This means that wind farms need to be placed in rural landscapes. In placing wind turbines in these areas, we ruin the beauty of the surrounding nature. Turbines are large and ugly in design and cause an eye sore where there could be extreme natural beauty. The last issue that wind turbines pose is that they are not as resourseful as people believe. Wind does not constantly blow, and thus wind turbines are often not generating any energy at all. Even when the wind is blowing, the windspeed can vary by 10%. This can cause the wind turbine power to vary by 25% which does not make it a stable energy source for the entire population, or any population. Wind turbines are limited in where you can place them as well. The area can not be obstructed by any large buildings, man-made structures, forests, or mountains. This means we are very limited in where we can place these wind farms. Over all, wind turbines are more trouble than they are worth, they harm the environment through means other than pollution and waste, and they are not a reliable source of energy.]]>

If there's a turbine lightning damage there could be another one near by which was caused no damage and could become the sole source of power during times when then electrical grid is out, especially when there are hurricanes, power outages or brown outs.

There are many disadvantages shown as for the wind not always being constant and also could endanger the wildlife. Wind energy is very useful in many cases because of the fact that the energy that is being consumed is not harmful to the environment. The power that the windmills release is very resourceful for each household, but there has to be a wind current in order to create the electricity that is needed. Without wind, the windmill would be useless and the power it dissapates is very low compared to a turbine. Another note that the student states is that a turbine can cause noise pollution. The meaning of this disadvantage states that the noise the turbine releases would disrupt the peace of the area it's in. Also, the turbine releases a low amount of energy; even though it is higher than what the wind would produce. The wildlife would be in grave danger if a turbine engine were to take the living space of the animal or species.]]>

Or say a plane crashed into it for some odd reason they would also be dead to they are a hazard for people and animals. Turbines also take up so much space , they put sometimes like 20 turbines together and it takes up like an acre with 20 of then , so that is so much wasted space. if we speaded them out more it wouldnt be that big of a problem. also they are really distracting an ugly.]]>

It is true that windmills can generate electricity however, to do so there must be a constant wind, which there often is not. Without strong winds constantly blowing windmills will not be able to produce sufficient electricity to feed the ever growing need of it by a rising human population. Further more windmills may be clean energy but require much destruction for their construction, windmills need large open areas to be built and to operate, while this may not be a problem in areas such as midwest America it can lead to the devastation of scenery and natural resources in areas lacking plains. This destruction of environment for the construction of wind farms would be devastating to the populations of many species of animals whose numbers are already in decline. Lastly wind farms would have to be placed farther from populated areas than general powerplants due to the noise they make which would bring great disturbance to the occupants of areas near them. Overall while it may be clean energy, it is to complicated and difficult to rely on as a main source.]]>

Another reason is that they are very noisy when you are living among the windmills. Turbines can also cause lightning to strike in rural areas throughout the country. First of all, The windmills arent always turning day and night. Which makes the energy that they produce good for nothing. The windmills are also very noisy which makes it hard at night for people to sleep whoever lives by the machine. For the machine to work it relies on a jet engine which causes collution just so people can have a little energy. Nuclear reactor facilities gives energy to the whole country but also pollutes more. The windmills would only power one city. Second of all, Turbines can cause lightning to strike in a rural area simply because its a metal behemoth in a land with only grass or rock. Lightning could cause fire to a farm nearby or even destroy some crops or livestock.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Though wind power is a cleaner source of energy than, say, burning fossil fuels, it has several drawbacks. For example, wind speed is not constant. Wind does not blow twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Winds are the outcome of moving cold and warm fronts, which are the outcome of uneven heating of the earth's surface by the sun. We know the earth's surface is heated unevenly, so how can we expect the winds caused by this to be even? A variance in the speed of wind by ten percent can change the turbine power by twenty-five percent. This makes wind power unreliable. Today's consumers are accustomed to reliable energy sources, and the fickleness of wind cannot satisfy those demands. Another argument against wind power is the effect of wind farms on the surrounding area. &quot;Planting&quot; wind farms uses land that could be used for agriculture or urban/suburban development. Also, migrating birds are endangered by the turbines, because they may be struck by the windmill blades. In addition, the noise pollution from a turbine is close to that of a small jet engine, which may frighten the wildlife in the vicinity, and will definitely disturb any humans living nearby. Add to all of this the degradation of the aesthetic value of the land. The turbines' design is seen as ugly by many, and wind farms take beautiful, natural landscapes and make them into dull and drear views of mechanical objects.]]>

Workers in the electrical field have presently debated all of positive and negative effects of wind turbines. Many people see wind turbines as an excellent supplement of power compared to natural resources such as coal and fossil fuels. However, there is a large majority of people who believe that the disadvantages of the wind turbines outnumber the advantages of them. Wind turbines are large machines that take up a lot of land and air space. Many people are concerned with what trees and forests they would have to take out to create more room for the turbines. By removing natural habitats, animals and wildlife can become endangered. With them being forced to leave their habitats with no where to go, their species are put in danger. Another concern is for migrating birds. With turbines taking up a large amount of air space, birds passing by or migrating could run into a turbine. Turbines pose an ultimate danger for birds, and endagered wildlife who are forced out of their natural environments. Another concern is the sight and the sound of the blades of turbines. Turbines are very large and stand out on rural landscapes. Wind turbines could be a disclaimer for lowering estate prices because of how loud and bulky they are. Turbines produce loud noises from the wind making them turn. This could lead to noise pollution in areas surrounding wind turbines. Ultimately, wind turbines have many advantages and disadvantages that should all be considered.]]>

There are plenty of other places to get our energy from that are more beneficial to our society. Wind energy is not an effective way to produce power because the wind is not always blowing, and the turbines create an obstruction. The wind is not always blowing making it hard for the turbine to do its job. It can't produce energy meaning we'll have to go use something else to get our energy from. Also, some places get more wind than others making it hard to distribute the energy. Not only are the turbines a bad way to aquire energy, they create an obstruction to forests, mountains, and buildings. Nature shouldn't be filled with huge turbines that make a lot of noise. Along with nature, they shouldn't be in cities because of there bulky design.]]>

For example, it may not always be reliable. The windmill blades on wind farms are, of course, powered by wind. If the wind is not blowing 24/7, that results an entire area of people without electricity. Also, wind speed has a tendency to vary by 10%, turbine power by 25%, so the power of these windmills is not always predictable, either. Implementing these large windmills on wind farms can also be a hassle. There is the hassle that comes in the form of obstructions such as forests, mountains, or buildings when deciding where to place the windmills, and once placed, they may be too big or ugly for the simple rural landscape and the families occupying it. Noise pollution following the noisy blades will also be a large inconvenience. All in all, though it may be cheaper, wind energy is not always be the best alternative because it is far too unreliable and uncredible.]]>

It's just so cost effective and i feel that we should start implementing this technology now before fossil fuels start running low and those prices sky-rocket. While the wind might now be blowing all the time, It's still very effecient when it is blowing. These technologies are advancing at a fast rate and the design of the turbines changes all the time. New turbines have nice, sleek, modern design that fits in with the land scape and does'nt give the landscape an industrial feel. There is best suited, rural areas where the turbines can be built so there isn't and obstructions, the energy generated can be transported to where it needs to go. Lightning damage is more of a &quot;cost of buisness&quot; but since technologies are advancing they can probably withstand these strikes, like airplanes do mid flight . Wind energy is the simple solution to the energy crisis we are currenty facing.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Many advocates of wind energy ignore, sometimes deliberately, the plethora of disadvantages of this emerging technology, including but not limited to: limited efficiency; aesthetical damage; and danger posed to wildlife, the ecosystem, and the environment. The principal argument negating the benefits of this new source of energy is the limited efficiency of the turbines themselves. Wind energy, of course, requires wind, without which turbines cannot generate energy; however, there is no location where the wind blows all day, everyday, thus producing energy 24/7, the first of many issues negatively affecting energy output. Furthermore, maximum efficiency would be reached where there are little or no wind obstructions - for example, forests, mountains, and man-made structures - but there are few such ideal spots, thus decreasing efficiency again. Even in chronically windy locations, wind speed varies by 10%, which equates to a 25% variation in turbine power. When taking the extremely limited efficiency of wind turbines into account with production costs, even advocates must acknowledge the foolishness of attempting this venture on a grand scale. There are, no doubt, a few locations ideal for wind turbines, but by definition they must be located somewhere distant from urban developments or civilization, in remote regions with not only no man-made structures, but no obstructing, naturally-ocurring geographic obstructions as well. This immediately increases production and development costs, which can be compounded with the cost of maintainence. The turbines must be continuously replaced or repaired due to damage inflicted by nature, especially lightning. Thus the output, energy, is not worth the input, money and resources. Efficiency aside, these turbines have a significant impact on the environment as well. Although the most appealing benefit of wind energy is its supposedly low impact on the Earth, this belief is ill-founded. Although there may be a limited carbon footprint, in its stead, there is a significant ecosystem impact; the turbines, placed in remote locations with plentiful wildlife, endanger wildlife, especially migrating birds. This is worrisome because of the already diminishing wildlife diversity because of humans' impact. Furthermore, they create significant noise pollution, and unnecessarily blemish what remaining testiments exist of Earth's former glory. Thus, overall, wind energy in theory has its merits, but the complications that accompany real-world scenarios clearly negate any and all benefits of this budding technology.]]>

The windmills were back then used to grind wheat and corn, to pump water, and to cut wood at sawmills, and now they are used to generate energy from the source of wind. Ever since the 1920's windmills have been used effectively, it has become one of the most cost-effective technologies in which people are taking advantage of in some areas. Using windmills gives you free power, especially in areas where the wind level is alot higher. Windmills have grown as a powerful source due to the fact that they do not generate pollution or radioactive wastes, they do not consume any of the non-renewable resources such as coal, oil or natural gas. Wind mills are also very effective when it comes to hurricanes, power outages or brown outs because they continuously give off energy. It is however a proven statement that is 2012 wind turbines in the United States generated almost about 3% of electricity and was equivalent to a total of 12 million houses. If larger turbines were ever connected to an electrical grid, it would give the people the benifit of wind power without having to own their own system. Overall, windmills are a postive outcome to our society and continue to create great things and help people.]]>

There isn't any natural source of continuous wind, so what happens when the wind goes away? When the wind mill blades aren't turning, energy is not being generated for domestic use. Wind mills are big and tall things, since they have to be high up to catch stronger winds. This could potentially be a threat to the lives of endangered wildlife such as certain types of migrating birds, and any other birds for that matter. Birds are animals who have had migrating formations and routes that have been used for hundreds of years, and they are acccustomed to follow them year after year. So what if wind mills were to be built just in time for migratinig season, birds could be hit by the swinging blades od the mill and get injured or die. Endangered species of birds could also be victims and their injury or death from possibly being hit by wind mill blades which could then lead to a decline in their already at risk speices.]]>

The turbines that generate wind energy rely, obviously, on wind, and because wind does not blow constantly, the turbines cannot generate energy reliably. This is similar to the effect of solar panels, which can only generate energy during the day. Wind speed and turbine power vary as well, by 10% and 25%, respectively. Furthemore, wind can be obstructed by forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures, exacerbating the unreliability of wind and therefore wind energy. Turbines have a high likelihood of being struck by lightning, due to their height and metallic composition, creating damage and costly repairs. Turbines are also rather large machines, and since they are often placed in remote or rural areas, their noisy blades and incongruity with a natural setting can ruin a landscape. Though wind energy is often hailed as a &quot;green&quot; and non-polluting source of energy, turbines' spinning blades are a danger to migrating birds and their placement in a natural habitat may be detrimental to endangered species living in the area. They can also be unpleasant for any humans living nearby, as turbines create significant noise pollution and groups of them in wind farms can create the volume of a small jet engine. Clearly, wind energy is an imperfect source of electricity, and its disadvantages may very well outweigh its advantages.]]>

In order for wind power to be effective, wind obviously must be present for the windmill blades to turn and generate energy. However, humans cannot create their own wind- sure, they can place windmills on areas exposed to more wind, such as the top of a hill, but it will not ensure that energy can be created 24/7. This is quite ineffective, as a lot of energy must be required to keep a household running. If no wind is present, there is nothing to be done, and the windmill is rendered useless. In addition, the blades are extremely noisy, adding on to the fact that noise pollution will be added to the already polluted Earth. To anyone living near windmills, they will have hours of noisy windmills outside their houses. Peace and quiet will be disturbed and it will be hard to continue to live in the area. Morever, wildlife will also be affected by the windmills becuase of their wide surface areas and ability to seriously injure any animals.This must be prevented as animals cannot tell what kind of trouble they will find themselves in. Protecting wildife is always something to keep in mind, as humans have already destroyed thousands of animal habitats with existing windmills. Installing more windmills will simply increase the amount of bird deaths, which will cause a rupture in the ecosystems and balance of life on earth.]]>

But when you have them it doesn't blow 24/7 so that isnt good about them because they would just out there doing nothing if they aren't being used. If the wind power isn't on the landscape of the high hills would really look awkward and really mess up the view of how it was orginally suppose to look at. Having wind energy could be good but i find it really dangerous for many flying animals that aren't from around here and they might think they can fly through the windmills but if they do they will die. Adding the windmills takes a lot of work to do because they would have to cut down forests, rearrange some mountains, and even ruin how things look.]]>

Yes, the wind energy caused damage to the environment. It has taken away the natural resources which has lead to a dangerous amount of pollution today. It makes a great amount of space, replacing mountains with building that had no place in being there in the first place. If they would take that amount of place, it should had build with less noise that scares the animals living around scared and move into the city where many get harm there. Wind Power only have enough power for people but need to thinkabout the animals that are surrounded. The turbines are way too huge that ruin the landscape, not only huge but a foul design that no one in the right mind want to see. Neighbors or just anyone passing by wouldn't want to see something like that. I can say that it does not blow 24/7, in that state we would loose pur energy. The wind speen varies by 10% as turbine power varies by 25%, not that mush power we are getting from them.]]>

Now with all of the technology that we have the energy is not that all from natural sources. We would still using the wind energy as uears ago. That's how we, the humans, are creating polution for our world, our lifes. We have to have in mind that if we were using the wind energy for just one source of energy, the world were not too contaminated as how it is now. Opposite points about wind energy. Wind energy is not a great source of energy. Is not too powerfull for the entire world population. It also,the blowing is not blowing 24/7 or over.Wind energy is also too noisy because of the sound that cause the blades of te engine machines.The turbines that the wind energy need to absorb it, are too big, they have a really ugly design and it also ruins rural lanscape. Instead of it, the wind speed varies by 10%, while the turbine power varies by 25%. That's is not even too powerful for the energy sources that we use. If we were using the wind energy, with thoose turbines, we had to install many machines to provide the energy that we use in just one day. With that in mind, all of thoose machines in our towns, we were creating noise pollution. And the last thing, is that we had migrating birs or other animals species.]]>

Its stated that they don't blow 24/7, they're big and noisy, they &quot;ruin&quot; the landscape, supposedly endanger wildlife, cause damage, and other things. In reality, it sounds like the student is just complaining about wind farms. There is a reason the turbines are so big, is so they can catch more wind, thus generating more electricity. Ruining the landscape is not true, most people do not live near these windfarms. Power constantly varies because of the on and off movement of wind which is true. It still as to be taken into consideration that wind power isn't the only power we have thats renewable. Noise pollution is a problem that could be solved in the future. With better design of windmills, they could be made quieter, but for now, its something that you just need to deal with.]]>

Another factor branching off of the location of windmills is the fact that yes, they do contain noisey blades, but since they are in rural areas it shouldnt be that much of a problem or bother. Focousing on the design of windmills, is a tricky thing. We have made designs so the windmill can function properly in the way we need it to, in order to supply us with energy. But the fact that the design is ugly can honestly ruin the beauty of rural areas. So thats our big question, how do we create a sufficent windmill and make it look good for the landscape? Well the answer is, in truth, that we cant really do much without it looking like a ugly sore in the middle of a field, or hill etc. So the basis of this plan is to think more about corresponding the windmill to something not as bad as our original plan, almost complementing the landscape around it.]]>

Because of this, energy is not being made all the time which detracts from the fact that it is a renewable resource. Also, the turbines are too big, the design is ugly, and turbines ruin rural landscape. The way the turbines look would potentially make customers wary to purchase them becuase it will ruin the landscape and obstruct veiws that were once pleasant. Lastly, the turbines can hurt endangered wildlife as well as migrating birds. The turbines are definitely not worth using if they are putting lives in danger. A renewable source does not make a difference if it is hurting the wildlife and more importantly, an endangered species. Wind power should not be used as a renewable source of energy.]]>

For example, it can generate energy well, but only enough for about 3% of the world's population. They also don't blow all the time. Certain days they'll blow more or less than the previous. Wind speed varies by only 10%, turbine power varies by 25%. Turbines, part of the windmill, are too big, ugly, and ruin the areas they are put into. Wind energy is beneficial but very noisy and can damage nature and man-made structures. With such a big size, it can endanger animals; birds migrating can be harmed and many habitats would be destroyed to create the room for a windmill. Wind energy is a good way to be cost and energy efficient but it has it's disadvantages.]]>

There are extended periods in which the wind mills are stagnant and do not produce energy, proving that the consistency and reilability of Wind Power is shoddy and unpredictable. More over, the blades tend to be noisy and unpleasant, creating potential problems with neighboring towns. If Wind Power were to become the primary source of energy in America, then we would have to find more places to put these wind mills, and could potentially run into trouble with placement in regard to people already living where the wind mills would ideally be placed. Continuing on in a similar trade of thought, it would be difficult to find large expanses of flat, unobstructed land. America is full of forrests, mountains, building, and hundreds of thousands of man-made structures that would hinder wind flow, creating even more unpredictable variables that make Wind Power even more unreliable. Although Wind Power is often hailed as an environmentaly friendly alternative to other energy sources, Wind mills endanger wild life, specifically birds in migration. Yes, an alternative to oil and coal is necessary, but one that is relatively unpredictable and endangers wildlife is not exactly a step in the right direction.]]>

You can't count on wind 24/7 because it's not constantly blowing. Some close to the turbines may complain about the noise it emits. It not only affects the people around, but the wildlife around the area too. There are endangered wildlife and migrating birds that are being threatened by the turbines. On top of the previous statements, it ruins the landscape. Since the turbines need to have open space without any obstructions, they are put in large open fields and on top of hills. This ruins and takes away from the natural landscape of the country.]]>

And the people who have to live by them would be disturbed by the noisy turning blades. Also why wants to live by a huge un attractive windmill that could potentially be very dangerous. Putting these up and removing trees that provide us with oxygen would make our economy even worse. Also building of these would mess with endangered wild life and migrating birds. Trying to get energy through this way only makes our economy decline even more. With these huge windmils up in a thunder storm they are huge targets to get struck by lightning. If that were to happen the houses in the surrounding area are at risk, and puts the home owners at risk. Just to get energy this way it causes great pollution which will make global warming advnce. How is building these a good thing if all it does is destroy the Earth?]]>

Not only is the volume and size of windmills a problem, but another disadvantage of wind energy is that it affects endangered wildlife and migrating birds. This is a big red light.

It brings about many problems for people considering switching to this source of energy. Weather is not an element that humans can contol and wind doesn't blow all of the time. When relying on this source of energy, it could cause major issues if the wind were to stop blowing and the energy stops being produced. Another issue of Wind Power is the noise that the blades can make and the space they take up in the environment. These blades can make noises equivalent to those of a jet engine and when placed in rural places, can cause a surpluss of disruptions for residents and animals. It also obstructs the beautiful views of nature.]]>

Some improvements like the noisy blades, maybe they should find a way to decrease the noise as possible. Another good reason for improvement is that the windmills are not always blowing 24/7, which could be changed and keep them on much longer.

For one, the use of windmills can be detrimental to numerous types of wildlife, especially birds migrating in the winter. The inconsistencies in wind speed and turbine power also create an unpredictable source of power that can produce sufficient energy, and insufficient energy at times. These turbines can also be prone to environmental disasters such as lightning, earthquakes and tornadoes. The wildlife in areas of windmills can be harmed significantly. Animals that get too close to these windmills, primarily birds, can be absolutely shredded and killed by these blades. The noise that windmills generate can also disrupt the lives of animals and prove to be harmul to their health. The inconsistencies that these windmills have can also prove to be a major problem. With wind speed varying by 10% (a very significant variable), the amount of energy produced can prove to be insufficient at times, especially when supplying a heavily populated city. Coupled with the varying turbine power (25%), this can be a very risky proposition, especially for densily populated cities. The noise pollution can prove to be a very dangerous problem for wildlife as well. The noise generated by these windmills can disrupt the habitats of many animals. This could also affect their circadian rhythms and biological clocks, changing their behavior, which could make them more or less hostile.]]>

In all honesty it is going to bring us down. In a big city like Los Angels we have many distraction already; Cars beeping thier horns, people yelling acroos the way, even quiet Library's still face the unsafisfaction of noise. Noisey blades just to be added to our misery, what more noise do we really need. The noise polution not only disturbs the sleeping children, but it also stop that happy bird in a tree, that the Windmill had taken the place of. We are in need of more nature and for the windmills to destroy more beautiful land is just awful. Thus Bringing in windmills not only doesn't provide power but it also is very distraction to everyone around us and destroies beautiful land marks of nature. Bid citiies do not need any more noise, bird homes do not need to be taken and finally it would not be worth the little power it does provide for us.

It is very hard to hear when you are around them. The blades are very noisy, and people compare the noise to that of a small jet engine. Another thing that is flawed, is the fact that wind does'nt blow 24/7. It may be a good energy source, but it isn't reliable at all, and the wind speeds change, so we may get more energy on one day vs the next when the wind isn't blowing as fast. If the wind stops blowing for a long time, then we would lose a lot of energy. These wind mills aren't indestructable either. They have been hit by lightning veryt ofter, which causes a large amount of damage, anf they endanger wildlife. They are very big, so they take up a lot of space, and migrating birds will ofter run into these blades because they don't have enough room to manouver around them. Even though wind power may be successful, it has it's faults.]]>

First it does not exist in all areas and second, in the areas where wind is abundant, this wind still cannot be promised to last for a full twenty four hours every single day. Without the wind blowing, energy will not be generated and therefore the machines will not be able to work full time and may cause manufacturing of industries using the wind energy to decrease from its potential producing ability if energy from another source had been used. Wind Energy obtained from windmills or wind farms will create an abundance of noise from the spinning blades and therefore cause the area or environment around the wind farms to be disturbed. It may affect animal habitats and cause both humans and animals to have to alter their usual habits or schedules. The caused noise is compared to a small jet plane which when flying above a certain area, some people may even have trouble hearing each other talk. This is unfriendly to the people populating the area where wind farms are built if this noise can potentially continue on for hours.]]>

Wind energy has been used throughout history, allowing for ample amounts of data to be retrieved on the defecits of it. It can create large numbers of distractions for a society that harnesses the power of the wind. The wind energy can also create a surprising amount of damage to the environment, contradictory to a piece of the glamour of alternative energy. Wind energy is a hassle for a society to accept into its life due to its many shortcomings and distractions it provides for society. Since wind energy relies on being able to harness the power of the wind at all times to function properly, there is a significant lack of power when the wind stops blowing. In many climates there is a lack of wind flow, making the alternative energy of wind power virtually useless there. Along with the lack of function when wind fails to blow, there is a variance in the wind speed in an area, leading to a variance in the amount of power that can be provided to a society attempting to function with wind power. The wind power can also fail to function if the turbine suffers from lightning damage, requiring a repair to occur lest the society wish for less power. Wind power also suffers from the problem of having a far-reaching negative effect on the environment around. The wind turbines contrast the beautiful landscape of the natural environment and can even obstruct the road to natural and artificial landmarks, creating an incovenience for the society it supposedly benefits. the wind farms that would be necessary to power a whole town would escalate these problems and cause huge annoyances due to the excessive noise levels. Along with the irritating, but truthfully small, problems, wind power could cause a huge problem for the wildlife. The blades on the windmills could cause a serious hazard to any bird populations around the area or any migrating birds that happen to be travelling by. With an artifical creation so hazardous, it would not be easy for the birds to avoid this potential damage, leading to a decline in the avian populations, leaving more indentations in the natural ecosystem caused by humanity.]]>

For example, wind blades are big and loud! Wind blades generate a lot of noise which can be hard to deal with if you live near a windmill farm. Having more windmill farms in or around rural areas would not be ideal or in the best interest for those communities,yes,having windmill farms in or around rural areas would be good for the environment but it would not be good for the health of the people living in those areas.Some people have trouble sleeping and im sure it would not help having a noisy windmill farm close by.Lack of sleep can cause irritability and crankiness,leaving people angry or over-exhausted. Things like being exhausted can lead to driving hazards like falling asleep at the wheel and getting hurt or hurting others. Another disadvantage is the look of the windmill. Windmills have big turbines and ugly designs that can take away from the landscape around then such as beautiful mountains,or grassy plains,or near the ocean where there is a lot of wind. Taking away the beauty of such things by placing a big hunking peice of metal there isnt very well thought out! People should be enjoying earths beauty not thinking about it withering away. Also, having a big piece of metal in forest areas could affect the wildlife! The windmills could distract from the actual trees leading birds to fly near the windmiolls and get hurt or ignore the nature around them.This could affect there migrating patterns greatly and should be looked into before putting any windmills near nature.]]>

With the wind not controlled by humans, it is a variable which may not always be constant. Wind does not blow all day and all night and periods can go a while without blowing. this would cause the local areas supported by the wind energy to be deprived of necessary electricity. Also, it is great noise pollution. the large blades rip through the aiur making the sounds of a small jet turbine engine. For local residents for both thouse who own their own windmill or close to others, it can have noise pollution which disrupts their everyday life. Along with these reasons, the large manmade sturctures serve as an obstruction to the nature. They can be damaged by lightning and other means which would be expensive to repair. Along with damage it obsturcts nature which turn a once beautiful rural landscape into a forest of manmade structures. It can also influence the migration of birds and endangered species blocking them from their usual paths killing many birds caught in the wind turbines. Although the use of these windmills seems like a great way to get clean energy, the reality is too much of pain then they are worth dir=srupting humans life as well as the life of many species.]]>

To begin with, the areas where these windmills are located are said to be extremely noisy. There are plenty of people who oppose the use and even the structure of the windmills. The design of the turbines is said to disrrupt the view of the rest of the landscape. People use this energy produced but they also seem to carte about how the environment looks. It is said that these windmils are obstructions to mountains, forests, and other buildings as well. Even though wind power is free, the disadvantage to it is that it is not blooming a total of twentyfour hours, seven days of the week. Windmills were used to begin with in the late 1920s and as of now, they are still creating noise pollution. Not only is the noise they make a problem for the citizens, the fact that windmills are a danger to the wildlife, and or other environmental friendly animals such as migrating birds cause a disadvantage.]]>

It is completely free, and the wind power does not consume any non renewable sourses, so it also does not generate pollution or any radioactive waste. Wind Power is in places free of obstruction, they are placed on top of hills and at shorelines so they do not get in the way of everyday life or cause any inconvinience to society. The wind can generate enough energy for many many households, but if they were to be connected to an electrical grid it will eventually create more energy to more people without having to own their own system alone.]]>

The problem with wind turbines is that it is not consistent.If there is a black out and the only energy source that is available is wind enrgy that would be great but if there is no wind it will be useless. Another problem with wind power is the huge turbines it can cause damage to animals. For example if the town wanted to biuld a wind turbine they would have to construct it and that would mean to destroy animal habbitats. Not to mention it is a problem to birds as well many birds love to fly and a huge wind turbine can cause trouble to birds it can harm them or worse cause death.Wind turbines are a great source but it is it really safe to use?]]>

These drawbacks vary from the size, endangerment, obstruction, and reliability. Windmills actually, have more cons than positive outcomes for the environment. For example, the size of windmills not only obstructs the views of the environment, but also poses a malicious threat to various wildife, such as birds, that are migrating. The huge, noisy blades from the windmill can easily bring down birds, creating endangerment to that species and a horrific scene around the windmill. As many people obseve throughout their lifetime, wind is unpredictable. This factor is substantial to mark wind energy as unrelaible. Dependency on wind power is a high risk gamble because there is no gurantee that wind will be blowing throughout the whole day. If chances are taken and wind isn't present, those with windmills will have no choice but to sit back in the dark and hope for the best.]]>

Although it is renewable and permanent, it also has many disadvantages. The windmills are not blowing during every minute, so power would not be completely available throughout the day. The wind blades are noisy and could potentially endanger wildlife, especially migrating birds. Wind farms could cause noise pollution with their turbines, which could be damaged by lightning. If we are going to change power sources, we should find something renewable, entirely reliable, and won't eventually cause harm to the environment.]]>

Not only are turbines ugly, they are a safety concern as well, they act like lightning rods and could start wild forest fires. On top of that turbines cost alot of money, and your average every day person can not afford a turbine, even if they could it would not produce enough energy within even 10 years to have been cost effective, so for most people, it doesn't make sense. A better option would be to have turbine fields, in the deserts or uninhabitable places similar to solar panel fields. This way the general public does not have to deal with all of the noise, health concerns, and turbines in general, who wants to look out from there deck over a big field with turbines scattered everywhere anyways? Are'nt the telephone poles and phone lines enough? Not to mention the possible harm to endangered bird species flying through the area, if turbines were kept in isolated fields this could easily be controlled, with a large net surrounding the turbine field protecting it from birds overhead.]]>

The student is not considering that wind does not always blows 24 hours a day, the climate can variate througout the day, some days can be windy and some days are not windy. Further more, the noise that is produce by the wind farms can generate a problem if there is a community living near by these wind farms. the noise the wind can cause can interrrupt the labor of people. In addition, there other type of problems like the massive proportions of the blades, if something goes wrong whit this obgectis it can cause a serious damage, also these wind farms cannot be located in an place, there has to be an specific location were there is no obstruction for the blades and were the wind can pass fluidly.]]>

First of all, windpower can't be used everywhere. It can only be settled in areas where there are strong enough winds to operate the windmills, to generate electricity. Also, it mostly ruins the rural landscape when constructed. Because windmills are often built on the country side than urban areas due to their large amount of required land, they have the possibility to mess up a usable, fine land. Building windmills can also interfere with the migration of the birds. They block the birds way when they're moving from places to places and might even injure them in a way. With the chance of killing an endangered wildlife, one should consider of its use. Lastly, wind power lets out a lot of noises and it can be very annoying to people or animals that live around it.]]>

As stated before, wind is a permanent source of energy, however, depending on the climate they may not be blowing at all times. Places, such as shore lines and tops of hills are the most efficient places to build windmills because wind speeds are always higher on greater altitides, but, when spaces become limited, they will be placed closer to sea level, causing less generation of wind and problems in communities or commercial areas. Turbine power varies by 25% instead of 10%. When placing windmills in more areas common to the public, it may disrupt its surrounding. The noisy blades can disrupt conversation between families at their houses or eating in a public place. Tourist attractions need to provide the most energy and with big turbines, the design becomes ugly and may not persuade tourist to go to a place where it was one an attraction.]]>

Wind can become a very good source of power when we start to run out of other non-renewable resources. Replacing coal, natural gas, and even oil with wind will reduce carbon dioxide emmissions in our atmousphere, but also reduce other harmful air pollutants. Throught the past year alone wind power has already generated 3% of the United States electricity for 12 million househols. Although there are many benefits from creating electricity from wind, there are many side effects to building wind farms. The problem with wind is that we can't depend 100% on it. Wind dosn't blow 24/7 through a specific place. Although we do know where certain wind paths form, many birds also use these paths as a migration highway. With blades spinning through the air this affects the birds fight path and may even harm many. It is also said that wind turbines are huge conductors of electricity. When a lightning storm passes by these big metal turbines may be damaged by the storms. Wind turbines need to be built in areas where wind blows constantly, if these places were to have trees and wildlife, deforsetation would have to occcur to have these machines built. There are many controversies on this topic. Many say we should build these wind turbines and have them produce more electicity throughout the country and others ssay we shoudln't. Theres just to much negative effects to have this become a perminate replacement for the resource we use today.]]>

Some days it doesn't blow at all. It is also unfortunate for the people that work for the wind farms because the blades are very nosy that might be irritating. Also, building wind farms might cause animals habitats to be torn down and the percentage rate of those animals to decrease. Windmills take up alot of space so it is harmful for those animals. They are also not appealing and boring to the eye. Passing by in a car and seeing a windmill would not look very fun whatsoever.]]>

However, wind energy is not as flawless as it is made out to be. Wind energy is ugly and unreliable. First off, wind is not blowing 24/7 so relying on wind energy as your main source of electricity is unwise. Also the blades on the windmills are very noisy and distrurb nearby residents. The turbines are big and ugly and and ruin rural landscape. There are also many things that can obstruct the windmills including: forests, mountains, buildings, and other man made structures. When wind power varies by only 10% is results in turbine power varying by 25%. Windmills are unnatural, therefore they should not be allowed in nature. They endanger wildlife and migrating birds. Turbines often suffer from natural disasters and have to be repaired, such as from a lighting stike or earthquake. Wind farms also create as much noise as a small jet engine which can disturb animals in the nearby habitat.]]>

Wind does not blow all the time which means we can only have power when it is windy. The wind turbines would disrupt our enviornment because it would be in the way of forests, mountians, and other things that we have or made. This wouldnt only have birds lose homes, but it is a danger to them when they fly, it is possible for the birds to hit or get hit by the turbine. It may not create radioactive waste, but it would cause noise pollution. It is equal to the noise of a small jet engine.

The weather in many areas can not be controlled by human beings. This means that wind does not always blow 24/7, allowing an inconsistent amount of energy to be produced. Also there is no guarantee that the wind speeds will by reliable. Wind speeds vary by 10% and turbine power varies by about 25% causing fluxations in energy levels. What the people want in regard to their energy is to be able to depend on a consitent flow of power. Not only does wind not provide a regular source of energy, it causes disruption to the land around it. To produce wind energy, multiple turbines must be built on large amounts of land. These turbines are absolutely too big and have such an ugly design to them that they may ruin the rural landscape. There is also a possibility that there are obstructions in the land area because of forests, mountains, buildings, as well as other man-made structures. These wind turbines can endanger wildlife by disrupting the migratory patterns of birds as well as cause an ample amount of noise pollution. Those who have experienced being around wind turbines have compared the noise, that the turbines produce, to a small jet engine. It may seem like wind energy is a good choice for energy but in reality it isn't perfect. There are many drawbacks to having to rely on the wind and there are other alternatives that can be used in place of it. It's time for a change regarding energy. Wind energy isn't the best choice for everyone.]]>

It also depends where the wind turbines are located, because obviously if they are placed in a place where it is dry then it will not generate any power. The turbines are also too big and the blades make too much noise causing disruption. We can noit forgot that they have ugly designs! One can also argue that the wind turbines take too much space and obstruct from forersts, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. As a rersult this will cause for many endangered wildlife and migrating birds. Also turbine lightning damage. This will also cause noise pollution on wind farms they almost sound like a smalll jet engine. It is also good to know that the wind speed varies by 10% compared to turbine power which varies by 25%. So, they're are many counterpoints that one could run against, but wind power is still better.]]>

They used them to generate electricity in rural areas. But on the other hand, it had also had some disadvanges. For example windmills don't blow 24/7 and when they do blow it is very loud. Growth in wind power has be supposrted by tax breaks for renewable energy.]]>

Wind turbines woul be powered by large blades circulating. Because the wind is being generated by the motion of the blades, there is no harmful factor in pollution. Wind power is a clean source of energy. Proof of wind power being succesful, would be the fact that it is powering 3% of America. That is on average of 12 million households. Although wind power does not cause any enviormental pollution, one might argue that it does cause noise pollution. This would be caused because of the large blades constantly spinning. The wind speeds would also factor into the noise level. It is also possible that wildlife such as birds, could be caught inside of the turbine; Because of these possibilities, one mightconsider wind power, obstruction to nature.]]>

For one, wind energy is not a resource that can be used 24/7. No, it is only useful when there is wind around and as we all know some days are unpredicatable. If the energy of the wind is not going to be around all the time then why is it necessary to excel it when there is nothing to excel. If exceling something that is not there it brings up more bad things than good. According to research, wind speed varies by 10% and turbing power varies by 25%. These percentages are not a high perecentages but low ones that do not promise anything good. If anything turbine can cause lighting damages. They do not only cause lighting damages but are also too big that leads to a horrible design with ruin rural landscaping structures. Windmills help create wind energy; wind pushes the windmills to work. Windmills are not all that great either. Windmills, create noisy blades that bothers everyone or anything around one. Not only do windmills have promblems with keeping quiet but there is a such thing known as noise pollution. Wind farms are there to make wind energy and with the help of their small jet engine it creates noise leading to the creation of noise pollution. Pollution is not a good sign to our enviroment and if it can be stopped then why not stop it? The creation of wind energy does not only brake promises, have pollution of some sort caused by noise, but also is an obstruction to the wildlife. The creation of wind energy is an obstructon to forests, an obstruction to mountains. an obstruction to buildings, and other man-made structures. The creation of wind energy is not a good thing but a bad one. It shows more negative than postive. As said before, if this negative can stop then why not stop it. Why continue this mess?]]>

Many areas have taken advantage of this innovative technology by creating large collections of windmills called wind farms. Windmill blades are sails tht turn in the wind and somehow generate energy. Also wind is a continually renewable and permanent energy. In addition, wind power can generate enough energy for large numbers of people. Growth in wind power has been encouraged by tax breaks for renewable energy.The student note helps us know more about wind, windmill blades, and wind power. Wind energycan also have some disadvantages. In addition, it can give us some lightning damages.]]>

Although wind power may be very efficient, it is not available everywhere. Of course in the whole world there is wind, but there are many places that do not produce as much wind as others. This clears up the 3% of U.S electricity that was made. If anyone reads that fact again you can condlude that 3% is basically nothing, 12 million households? Out of how many there are in the U.S. I do believe the wind power may help in some aspects of our energy, but it shouldn't not in all, and it should not be our first reliable source for energy.]]>

Windmills have emerged in areas of the western and mid-western United States, where wildlife and big landscapes are abundant. The turbine that generates energy are moved by wind, causing them to rotate in a way that obstucts the mountains and trees near it. In contrast, the turbine allows clean energy to be produced without exerting harmful gases and materials in the atmosphere. However, wind doesn't blow 24/7. This means that without wind, energy cannot be created and this causes a problem in our society because energy is constantly needed to sustain life. These huge turbines also pose a threat to the wildlife around it because it can injure birds that accidently fly into the swinging blades. Not to mention, the blades on the windmill are noisy and the turbines aren't attractive compared to the beautiful rural landscape around it. Overall, wind mills do not mesh with the rural wildlife around it and cannot sustain soceity's need of energy because wind isn't constantly blowing.]]>

Windmill blades turn in the wind and generate energy. Wind flows over the blades creating lift and causing them to rotate. The motion of the blades is very noisy and even creates noise pollution. in addition to its' nosiness, the turbines don't function 24/7. Many people don't like the bulky design, claiming that is ugly and ruins rural landscape. Because of the ruining of rural landscape, many species and endangered and birds migrate. Scientists claim that wind energy is beneficial, but, there are many flaws that are unaccounted for.]]>

Noisy blades can cause irritation to people and it can either keep them up at night or be an annoying sound during the day, its something to look into and fix before it gets worse. Most of the things in this students notes are huge errors with this wind power espicially the pollution and the wind speeds those can cause some damage and lead up to injury in any way.]]>

First off, the sources for wind energy would not blow 24/7. It would only start working during emergencies. The blades are too noisy and may disturb people who would live by them. The turbines are also too big and have a bad design which can make a nice place look unusual. It can also ruin the rural landscape. The wind speed varies 10 percent than the turbine power which varies 25 percent. The sources of wind energy would also endanger the wildlife and the migrating birds. Some other disadvantages are that during a lighting, there may be damage caused due to how strong it was. Wind energy would also have small jet engines.

Wind energy does have it's pros and cons, but i believe that it has more cons than pros. There are times that wind does not blow at all. It is usually windy when it is couldy or after it rained or even just becasue high winds are coming in, but wind is not constant. People talk bad about the windmills because supposedly the blades are too noisy; that is a con but it can be turned into a pro. Many are always concerned about the landscape and that the turbines ruin the landscape, but in a sense they can be redesigned better. The wild life could be endangered due to the turbines. Specifically the migrating birds. In a case where there was to be a thunderstorm, the turbines can easily attract lightning. With that being said, the lighting could damage the turbines and other things around.]]>

It's the newest and cleanest way to still use sufficient energy in our society to keep stable. Winds might not be blowing all the time but when they are energy is being produced. Energy that can be used to power our daily appliances needed for todays daily life. The turbines might be noisy and big, but they are rare to be seen. I have never seen a turbine in the middle of a city, which means they are located in rural areas where it will not bother anyone, like maybe the dessert of the ocean. Wind energy is the best option there is to obtain enough energy, and better since it doesn't cause any pollution. We no longer have to be burning anything for energy, we just wait for the wind to do all the work which i think its the best option. They will not harm endangered wildlife since most turbines are located in oceans and desserts. There is a lot we can do with wind energy.]]>

One reason why wind energy has an disadvantage is because it does not blow everyday and all day. On the other hand, we do not need to depend on it all day, morning and night. It shouldd be used for good reasons such as in paragragh one the student states that its used to grind wheat and corn, pump water, cut wood at sawmills,and generate electricity. At night it does not need to be needed when going inside where the outside work is done and electricity does not need to be used as much. Another reason why wind energy is an disadvantage is because the windmills have very noisy blades when they turn and rotate and the turbines are too big,have an ugly design and would ruin rural landscape. THough to fix that problem designers that make and create the windmills can easily prevent them from having noisy blades. They can also design them to make them attractive to the consumer using it to make it colorful, attractive and beautiful as they spin on people's yards. The problem of ruined landscapes because of these windmills can be solved by putting them in places that won't destroy lands. Furthermore, windmills and turbines and wind energy have a wind speed varying from 10% when wind power varies by 25%.They can cause danger to endangered animals and migrating birds that are around these possible hazards. As a solution to these problems the consumer using these sources should supervise how much wind is being blown so that they have enough wind but not too much that will cause damage and desruction. People setting these windmills and turbines should be aware of wildlife they live around and the seasons of when birda migrate. Of these disadvantges of windmills, turbines, and wind energy, there are ways to solve these problems to make te world a better place, solve the problems to have an advantage of having wind.]]>

It is an alarming statistic that will test humankind's dependency on nonrenewable energy sources. Propsed solutions for clean green energies have long being debated. What would be the magnitude of benefits in comparisons to its downsides. The issues that one source of clean energy, turbines, are its varying uncertainty. The uncertainty in its overall effectivity can be quiet dissapointing, the ideal senerio that comes into mind is its consistent power generation. However this is not the case, wind speed varies by ten percent simultaneously, turbines vary by twenty-five percent. this means that the output may not neccessarily compenstate the needs of the electric consumer. Thus, the need for more turbines increases and consequentially does the cost. Furthermore, the fact that wind is not active twenty-four seven puts a stain on the whole ideal.The reality is that turbines are not implemented in the most ideal locations, due to the distance and convenience of the electric consumer. Therefore, the investment may not at all be worth it, the consempation may take decades to be received. During that time interval, much can change and the turbines themselves wont be needed as technology advances.]]>

They can ruin the habitats of wildlife and can cause possible extinction of a certain species. It disrupts the lifestyle of birds in the area. The birds can be migrating and get caught in the turbine that will lead to death. Many animals choose to call trees their home but how can they when acres of land is covered in tall metal posts. The possibilty of wind not blowing all the time is very high. Weather changes everyday and every minute. The windmills can create the wind habits in an area to hault and all of the money invested in the windmills would be useless. Also if they are too loud it will stop people from living near them because no one wants the sound of a small jet engine to be roaring at all hours of the day. It can ruin rural landscape and it cannot be disguised as anything since it must be moving all the time. With this people will not want to move by an area with a view of windmills. This form of wind energy can attract lightning during storms and raise the possibility of a person getting struck by lightning.]]>

One of the largest issues caused by using wind energy is the amount of space they take up and the problems this causes. Several hundred wind turbines are needed in order to create a suitable amount of energy, and because of the noise pollution they produce they are constructed in less populated areas. The disadvantage of this is that they take up space that was once occupied by wildlife, and their constructed causes a disruption in the local ecosystem. Along with this, the flight patterns of birds might cross the wind turbines, and the giant blades are deadly for anything flying through. One of the other serious disadvantages is the fact that wind is not a reliable source of energy. It fluctautes, and this unrealiability causes the energy produced by the wind turbines to be as such; unreliable. Even in places where is is commonly windly, the amount of wind is not gauranteed and energy is something that is always in demand in large amounts, so if the demand is not able to be met then problem occur. The final disadvantage of wind energy is obvious: the amount of money and resources it takes to make one wind turbine is large, yet even with the amount we have right now, they only generate about 3% of the U.S.'s total energy. Imagine how many it would take in order to get that number to a significant amount, especially considering the cost of producing just one. Overall, they are very inefficient and although they are seen as causing less pollution, they actually cause more harm to than environment than most people realize.]]>

Only during a certain time of the day does wind have enough force to move the blades and wind does not blow all day. Having them in the mountains where wind is more abundant will make the landscape less natural and more of an eye sore. While in the mountains they are in danger of earthquakes and other natural disasters. Wind is not consistant in speed and natural &amp; man-made structures will block and/or slow down the wind. The windmills will also produce loud noises interupting mating calls from animals. This is why windmills are not the best option for a renewable source of power.]]>

He has many statements that make sense and some that do not make any sense. He's opposing how there's plenty of tax breaks because they want to build new neergy fields. This student has many details on how these solar wind powers work and how much of a history they have. It seems in his article he is against getting new windmills and renewable energy. This student is referring to spending less money on re newable windmills and other power mills. I support this student because yes they spend too much money on the windmills and energy and keep replacing new ones with new ones i just think they should wait and when on of them is too old then replace that one and get a new one. There's no need to get new windmills and energy every second of the time when they can re use that energy to get less taxed in a year.]]>

They can be very enviornmental friendly but its pretty useless. We should keep the windmills as it is and just leave it. Theres no point of pursuing something that won't be look at from people that has the authority of even making changes to it. We should focus on bigger things such as the homeless and the schools dropout rate. Or even the employment rate. Things that actually matter in the world.]]>

In todays society, windmills have turned into giant turbines that are raised, high into the air. The problem with that, is that the giant turbines take too much room, especially in rural land scape and for a lot of energy to be produce, they'ed have to build more Windmills to do so. since the windmills are man made, some can argue that the massive structures are destroying the natural areas in the forest, mountains, and etc. Windmills put together, can produce quite a amount of electricity, but only if there is wind blowing the large noisy blades. The small jet engines can only produce energy, if there is wind being blown at it, then again, wind does not blow 24/7. allowing windmills to be only useful if there is a strong enough wind current to blow the giant blades to power the small jet engine. yet windmill usually see wind speeds up to 10%, which powers 25% turbine, producing a minimum amount of energy for certain areas. Even though turbine technology can produce green energy, the small jet engines, built inside, produce noise pollution, especially, due to the loud blades of the turbines which effects small wind farm, or where ever it is stationed. windmills can be a hassle and should not be used to conserve energy and produce green energy, because there are more effective ways that are green and can help store and produce energy to massive cities, farms, to rural areas.]]>

For example in order for wind turbines to work they require wind and wind doesn't always blow 24/7, even in really windy areas. Then even if the wind is blowing wind speeds can vary by 10% which causes turbine power to vary by 25%. In addition with the wind, the turbines themselves also have problems. The turbine blades are very noisy and causes a significant amount of noise pollution especially if they are gathered into a wind farm. Lastly the turbines can ruin a rural landscape and even endanger bird populations.

They leave no trace of radiation and is a clean source of electricity, also with this kind of energy it has helped replace solar and hydroelectric power and doesn't consume non-reusuable resources.Wind farms use wind to create natural, permanent, reusable energy that can be used when the electrical grid is down. Wind power only takes care of a small percentage of the US electricity but has a great effect on 12 million households. The cost of turbine power has decreased since the 1980's and the efficiency of these farms has increased, giving more power than thought to before. Though wind farms do produce clean electricity that the US is in dire need of, it effects the endangered, migrant bird populations and ruins the rural landscaping. Wind does not last 24/7 and doesnt produce as much energy as most would wish for. For other farms and people near by it is a source of noise pollution that no one is fond of and there could be damage to the turbines during most storms. When creating a wind farm there is obstruction of forests, mountains, buildings, and other man made structures changing the land to only make a small effect on the electric power. Even though these farms have noise pollution and can be a danger to migrating birds and wildlife there is more out there polluting thier habitats with electricity production as well. It seems that is is less risky to have a wind farm than produce power by using non-renewable resources and end up with the same amount/more pollution that will endanger migrating birds as well. Not all of the wind turbines obstruct rural land; usually they are seen in an open field or in a hilly coutry side that is not being used.]]>

First off, the windmills may not supply the ample amount of energy needed to provide for an entire area. Many windmills are unable to blow 24/7, especially when the proper weather conditions are not provided. For example, if there is lightning damage to the windmill, it may not function and provide the energy that is needed. As a result, many families may be without electricity during specific seasons where it is needed most. Furthermore, without the consistancy of electricities in households, many are unable to function regularly. In addition, the idea of windmills may not be practical in certain areas. Not only can they be unappealing physically, they can also be disrupting. For example, they can be obstructions to office buildings, causing safety hazards or even provide as distractions. On the other hand, windmills can also destroy natural habitats, by causing deforestation and other means that could possibly inhibit the function of natural organisms. Birds may also accidently collide or be injured by these windmills they are not used to. Furthermore, although the windmills may not produce chemical pollution, they give off noise pollution through their jet engine that could disrupt people or scare off animals. All in all, the disadvantage of wind energy outweight the advantages, and thus should be the reason why wind energy should not be relied on in society.]]>

Some windmills are hulking skyscrapers that can be a hazard to birds in the area, especially the endangered species. The turbines seem oversized and are not very aesthetically pleasing. The wind farms themselves look to be out of place and intrusive in the middle of windy plains or the center of plateaus. There are a limited amount of locations for the sites of wind energy plants since natural and man-made wind-breaking obstructions alike do not allow for effective energy production in many areas. Wind speeds also vary drastically, and they are not a constant, nonstop supplier like most other energy sources. The wind turbines themselves can also be an environmental hazard. They often attract lightning, being that most of the time they are the highest metal object in their vicinity. Noise pollution can also be an issue. It has been reported that the wind farms produce noise similar to that of a small jet engine. Noise at those decibels can severely and permanently damage the ears of wildlife with sensitive hearing within the proximity of the windmills. Wind power can solve some of our energy problems, but it can cause other problems for the ecosystem.]]>

Windmills are utilized to obtain energy source from the air however, they do not provide sufficient energy.For instance, the windmills utilized to formualte energy can not function 24 hours a day weekly. Thus, demonstrating that although this source of obtaining energy appears to be efficient it is not. In the 21st century humanity is no longer conservative it's constantly globalizing its self whether it be socially, economically, or politically. This impells society to use energy for exportation and importation of products; there is also ideas dispursing throughout countries. Due to globalization energy must be used for these exchanges. Although windmills provide energy they are perniciously hurting environmental species such as birds. Obtaining wind energy requires large turbines with sharp blades; these blades can easily slaughter migrant birds. Despite that windmills do protect the environment when regarding pollution however, they denounce harmless organisms such as migrant birds that ultimately make up the environment. Obtaining wind energy means that windmills must be used therefore, there are they must be placed in environments with minimal humans. These remote locations include forests, mountains and possibly islands. Either way the environment will be damaged therefore, using wind energy is ultimately harmful for the environment. In addition widmills do not provoide sufficient energy to a globalizing 21st century.]]>

Lightning damage is common with windmills, the lightning strikes windmills on cloudy days and frys the mechanical brain inside the windmill that generates all the energy. This damage hinders the windmill while people repair them, and no energy is being made. Another disadvantage are the obtructions that do not allow windmills to work properly. For example, a large amount of open space is required to be able to put windmills since they are big and spacie. Obstructions get in the way and make it difficult for wind energy to be able to function.]]>

First of all Wind dosent blow constantly and they are quite large and easily get in the way of migrating birds. If you havent seen one before they make land look horrible and dont fit any kind of setting especially rural. Above all these mills are loud, a farm is the equivilant to the noise of a small jet engine. Not to mention how easy it is for them to attract lightning and with that the repair of its damages. These mills are a waste of time. However these mills may still have some benefit to our enviorrnment, we are constantly looking for renewable sources of energy and this kind of energy may grow to benefit us in the future, but for now these drawbacks need to be resolved before we pour more money into these wind farms.]]>

If not placed properly the windmill will render inefficient and not be worth while. Just building the windmill itself would cost large sums of money and with the cost of transportation and building them the toll just wont be great. If the windmill is just placed in a place of no wind activity the use of it will not be greater than that of the price of placing it.]]>

New so called &quot;better&quot; strategies such as Wind Energy seems to be promising because of its ability to produce energy without supposably damaging the environment, but when you really pay attention and research how it works, its just as bad as other strategies. If you pay attention to turbine blades around your area, you might notice that the blades are not always blowing like they are supposed to be to make power. Some actually spin the normal speed, but makes a terrible screeching sound of a giant needle scratching a glass. This disturbs the wonders of nature and can damage people's hearing if they live nearby these machines. Turbines that don't move or hardly move are not worth it because wind speed varies by 10 percent while turbine power varies by 25 percent. What's the point of having big ugly turbines that ruins the view of rural landscapes if they hardly make any energy for us at all. It's true, they make energy without causing global warming, but the cost of that little energy is not worth the disturbance they cause in nature and rural communities. As mentioned before, turbines can really destroy the environment around them. In order to build turbines, forests must be cut down and mountains must be manipulated to actually build man-made objects on top of it. Not only does it ruin the nice rural landscape, it also forces animals to move out because they want to avoid the ugly sound it causes. Turbines also suffer from lightning damage, so when that occurs, anything around it can be badly hurt and the turbine is just left there to rot. Animals who commonly get reallly hurt by turbines are birds. Unfortunately, migrating birds are beat down by spinning turbines and most of the time, they don't survive this. It is very important to preserve animal life, especially birds because some species are becoming endangered and these turbines are not helping at all.]]>

The Wind Energy and the Windmill are both being compared to see which one would be beneficial for the Americans and the environment. The Windmill running on the wind, can only be used on windy days. Wind Power, only run in areas where the wind speeds are higher such as: shoreline, top of a hill, and places free of obstructions. Wind Power would be better used by Americans, because they would be in specific areas, and if there isn't any wind they'll be able to run on solar power. Having a Wind Power would also be good because it allows the people to have their own wind without owning their own wind system, and the cost of wind powers has decreased allowing more people to own wind powers. Not only can the wind powers be used in areas where the wind is higher but also in brown outs, power outages and hurricanes. Wind Power can only be used in these areas with solar power. Solar Power, is beneficial for Wind Power because if its a hot sunny day, the wind power can still produce wind because of the solar power. Wind Power, would be running on the suns sun rays. I agree with the Wind Power being the best option for wind energy because the wind power will always be running even in the wind especially if its windy and there is no turbine lightning damage.]]>

Everyone had the idea that windmills were perfect to produce electricity, but they weren't efficient at all times. Windmills did not always benefit power source and to the environment. Although windmills are a great source of electricity, it's not always efficient. Wind pressure and wind speed will always affect how much electricity is being produced. If it was a non-windy day, not much electricity would be produced. No one can control the weather and that's why it's hard to produce electricity. How fast the wind is blowing also affects how fast electricity will be made. If wind speed only varies by 10%, turbine power will only vary by 25%. Another reasdon why windmills are bad for the environment is because of the design and area of placement. Windmills are huge and placing them anywhere will damage rural landscape. Depending on the design, how big it is will take up space. Forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made strucutres could be taken down and ruined becuase of turbines. Animals could be endangered because of the buildings of windmills. Windmills will destroy animal homes, disrupting their habitats. Endangered creatures such as birds and animals who live on the ground or in trees. Contruction on windmills will destroy animals and their homes, causing them to migrat to a different location. The endangered wildlife should not be disrupted. Animals are living creatures who should be left in the wild and untouched. It would be terrible if someone destroyed your home because they wanted to contruct something on it.]]>

Some of the disadvantages to wind energy are the blades not blowing 24/7, they are noisy, there are already many obstructions such as forests, man-made structures, buildings and mountains, and endangering wildlife and migrating birds. If the blades aren't blowing 24/7, not enough energy will be created for use. Also, noisy blades could irritate some and get annoying. Since there are already many man-made structures and forests, it could be difficult to find an appropriate place for wind energy sources with dangering forests and buildings. Finally, the wind energy could endanger wildlife and migrating birds that are passing through the energy source locations.

For starters, windmills are oportunistic souces of energy, only producing when they are struck by a breeze at just the right angle, and most places dont experience 24/7 winds, time spent without wind is time spent not making energy, and throughout all this the turbines are just sitting there like ugly monoliths obstructing what could and indeed should be beautiful scenery. Then of course there is the issue of location. Most locations are not suitable for wind turbines, in fact anywhere where a turbine is built is going to be useless for much else, no one will want to live there because of the horrible noise they make,and they take up too much space to be alongside factories. &quot;Free&quot; is just an expression people use as an incentive without proper justification, windfarms are not free, they are in fact expremly expensive to maintain, they are prone to lightning strikes being the tallest strucures around and repairing them is a costly and time consuming process.]]>

For example, the noise power that may disturb the community but, in my opinion if it generates power and helps it out it is probally a good idea to keep them around. Another disavantage in the students notes was the wind not blowing 24/7 . Whitch is true because if the wind isn't always blowing where is the power going to come from? Well the times that it dose blow the power and the energy is free whitch is a great advantage. These students also pointed out the nature or animals that may be at risk to be harmed do to powerful blades. The animals such as birds who fly and migreat may be at risk of getting injured or possible death from the blades or windmills . Why start to harm animals or wildlife around just to have free power . This is a case where in my opinon is wrong animals or species can go extint. So all together there are pros and cons to this but if you are talking money wise I say keep them.]]>

The windmill blades are big and noisy and can be a distraction. Having ugly turbines will ruin the image of the beautiful rural lanscape. With the high amount of endangered wildlife, big windmills will create an even bigger death rate for migrating birds.

First of all, because the wind farms are not blowing 24/7, they have noisy blades, the turbines are too big with ugly desings, ruin rural landscape, wind speed is 10 percent which is not that fast, and also is endangered many animals such as migrating birds, the turbines also have lightning damage, they also have a noise pollution, wind farms have small jet engine. this are the disadvantages that students think based on what they reasearch. but based on the article the wind energy has become one the most cost effective emerging technologies in many areas like western and mid-western united states. specially in those places they have taken advantage of the new technology by creating windmills and wind farms which are very helpful because they create energy. it also say that that wind power does not generate pollution or radioactive waste. In addition, in 2012 wind turbines generated 3 percent of total US electricity which is alot because it cover about 12 million households. I believe the students make their notes based on the way the win tubines look and sound and not based on how helpful they are for their community.]]>

The wind energy that had occured then was not always blowing the air 24/7, when they would spin the blades would make a lot of noise. When they had built these models they didn't come out the way they had looked when they were drawn up; the models were poorly designed, the turbines were too big for the windmills and they had to make sure that they had to be on a specific landscape in order to get things running right or to what type of energy that would be able to move these windmills. The location of these windmills had a specific windspeed, the wind speed that was created varies to about 10% and with the turbine power varies by 25%. These windmills also endangered wildlife and the migration of birds, these windmills can be harmful cause, a bird maybe caught in the blades or the birds can do something that may harm the energy source in a way. The turbine lighting damage can be caused by an electrical grid that may cause lights and utilites to go out and have an power outage that we would have to fix and to re-power up to get it to run back up. Wind power does not generate pollution or radioactive waste, this does not consume any re-newable resources such as coal, natural gases, or oil.]]>

However, turbines require wind so if the wind isn't blowing as hard as usual, there can be as much as 25% less power being produced. Another good thing about wind power is that it'll work when there are power outages or other reasons for power from other sources of energy to be lost. Although this is a major benefit, the turbines can be damaged by lightning so there isn't a 100% chance they'll be there when needed. And lastly, the student says that wind power is produced away from people in rural areas so it doesn't really have an effect on everyday living. However, there are people who live in rural areas who have to deal with the noise pollution and general ugliness of the turbines by their homes. These people deserve to have their peace, because after all, the quietness of rural areas is one of their greatest attractions.]]>

This begins in nature, where the wind comes and goes. As it is not a consistent aspect of weather, there is no way to predict how long an area can be run with this method of farming the world's resources. It has been shown that a variance in wind speed of ten percent will result in a variance in turbine power of twenty-five percent. Additionally, these large metal structures will not last well in fields as they attract lightning. Moreover, they ruin the beauty of an open field with their massive, disgusting design. Not only do they ruin the visual experience, but also the pleasant silence of the country is plagued with the sounds of multiple turbines constantly running. It can be said that wind energy is a good renewable resource, but it certainly has just as many drawbacks as any other, if not more.]]>

Although there are many advantages to using wind power, primarily because it is environment friendly, there are many downsides to this method which is why it has not become a major source of energy used by households in America. The unreliableness, the potential it has of endangering wildlife, and the design are a few of the reasons wind power is not the best source of energy. If people rely on wind power, there is no guarantee that wind will be blowing 24/7. People do not have the sufficient amount of time to be waiting for wind to pick in order to be able to do everyday tasks such as use the washing machine or keep the refrigerator running. Apart from that, wind speed varies so one minute you can have plenty of energy making appliances work well and the next they wil be slow and barely running. As for when there is plenty wind, the blades are turning at a fast rate. If there happens to be a flock of migrating birds passing through there, they will be sliced and killed on impact. The innocent birds are unaware of these great big machines, and they can continue to fly into them until eventually an entire species is gone. The design of the wind mills is also a disadvantage because many people feel they are just too big. It ruins the rural landscape and makes it unwanting for people to live there. Also considering the size and the environment wind mills need, it is not in their favor to be in large urban cities where most people reside. Wind mills also add to an already existing problem, noise pollution.]]>

Forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures may decrease the use of the wind by obstructing the wind. Turbines ruin the rural landscape and are big which causes a a decrease in land availability due to these turbines. Turbines also hav e lightning damage from storms that pass over them. Also, another contributing factor to the counterview is that these man made objects that are used to conduct energy and electricity from the wind inhabit an animals territory. Wind farms encroach on indigenous animals space and cause them to become endangered. Although, there is a good and a bad side to wind farms and turbines, using wind for energy saves money and space.]]>

However people would argue that windmills are not the powersource they would like to use. Owning your own windmill can cost you upwards of 2 million dollars, they also only work some of the time. Windmills can kill passing birds and may even be damaged by a falling tree. Bottom line windmills do not seem to be as reliable as some would think. Turbines dont fit the rural landscape that you would want a windmill in, they are also known to be struck by lightning. Also they are really loud, a windmill farm sounds like a small jet engine. If i havent convinced you by now then go ahead and get a windmill, lets see how much you want a windmill once you have one.]]>

Windmills has many flaws of its one, other than it not being radioactive. Powerplants are working non-stop unlike windmills, which rely on wind to make the electricity is not as reliable. Wind may vary on, it is never constant at the same speed, the wind needs to be strong enough to move the windmills heavy pepellars to cuonduct electricity. While neuclear powerplants and other electricity sources rely on more reliable source. Besides the fact that windmills needs a reliable constant strong breeze, the location for these huge perpellars is very specific. These windmills farm are usually out in the valley where nature is at peace, but with the making of these farms more of earths nature is being destroyed. It is an endangerment to wildlife animals and migrating birds. Many birds flying over these farms get hit by the perpellars. No creature should move out of their home for these mills. These farms are built over forest, mountains, and even man-made structures. Windmills are not the only ecofriendly choice for conducting electricity.]]>

My opposition claims that wind turbines have already given power to 12 million Americans, which may be true, but to nationalize it into becoming one of America's primary sources of energy could be devastating to the natural enviroment. It is important to note that wind power can vary incredibly, just a 10% change in wind speed could result in a drop of 25% power, and because of that, it is simply not enough to have just a few turbines. Instead, turbine farms would begin to sprout up. Hundreds of these gigantic, blades would all have to work together in unison to create enough energy to compete with any form of modern energy. Imagine driving along California's mountain roads, seeing hundreds of these iron spires huddled together everywhere to turn. Add to that the fact that just a few of them could rival the noise of a Los Angeles airport. Renewable energy is without a doubt something our country should be popularizing, but efficiancy is something that needs to be accounted for. These wind turbines are all work, with little gain. Instead, we should be working twoards perfecting solar, and hydroelectric energy.]]>

First of all, having the turbines/windmills can affect obstructions such as forests, mountains, buildings and all the other man made structures with their position in areas that have everyday life to enhance. The location may be the difficulty due to the fact that if windmills are placed in a not preferable location disagreements may develop causing conflicts with the wind energy. In terms of the forests and mountains their landscape have a more rough outlook due to all their features and habitats included in them. Thei physical features can contradict with the design of the windmills causing destruction to the features and surroundings. The endangering of wildlife and the migration of birds has play in this technology that has been emerging. The reason to why animals may be put into risk is to traveling birds can come across this massive object costing their life and for the animals down below it can have risks even though it can seem it doesn't. To some people lives of animals may not be as important as our energy but in reality they are as important. The windmills are a positve turn out in our lives but who knows if little by little we will all come to be annoyed and distracted by the noises the blades shall give. Not all people have the ability to be concentrated and let such a noise get through their day. People are very needy and things have to go their way later on noises and such blowing porobably will be the reason for wanting to remove and go back to our regular energy sources other than saving money and making our community better as a whole.]]>

In the first paragraph he talks about how wind energy has been used since the 1920's and that a lot of people have started to use it because its a good way to power our things. Going into paragraph two the student explains how windmills work and how they are powered with their blades and the wind. Wind power is free and does not cause pollution or radioactive waste, it also does not consume any of the non renewable resources such as coal, natural, gas, or oil.]]>

Yes wind is free not only is the windmill really expensive but dont forget there isn't wind 24/7 to cunduct energy for you. most of the actual windmills are creating noise polution which is bad for lobal warming. Yes don't get me wrong you save money on yor electric bill but your light quality dims because of how low the energy source is working for you. let's not forget the blades they are the noisiest part on windmill they are annoying and wil not let you sleep at night. The only way that i know of that a windmill will actually help you is if you get atleast 3 but that must cost fortune. Yes othere people would rather go that way to save money on energy but lts not forget the windmill can be quite pricey. Now, the turbines on the actual windmill have the ugliest design ever and it will ruin rural landscape. Now there is lots of migrating birds the windmill is so hgh it is danger for birds passing by.]]>

Many believe that this technology has improved our lives and society, stepping towards the world of renewable and permanent energy. However, the wind energy has some negative effects of its own at the same time. Using windmills to create energy is just fine, but the production of energy is not guaranteed. Some of the disadvantages may be that the wind is not blowing all the time and the blades are noisy. Wind energy can be disadvantage because wind is not blowing all the time. To create energy from the windmills, we definitely need wind. However, we can never predict the future and the natural disasters. We never know when there might be a drought and when the wind might stop. The consequences will be significant if we only rely on wind to create energy. Also, the blades of the windmills used to create wind energy make very loud noises. They are hard to get near to. People who live near by the windmills nay have permanent damages on their ears.]]>

A reason why windmills would not work is because there isnt wind 24/7 so it would some parts of the day without electricity. Also because theres places that get no wind at all and then there wouldnt be any wind produced. The turbines from the windmills also endanger the wildlife such as migrating birds, the birds may fly into the turbines which would kill them and it would cause a great loss of bird life. To build these windmills it would be neccessary to cut forests down and clean out mountians and we would loss a great amount of fauna. Another reason why windmills are not a great idea is because of the problems they cause. One problem they cause is noise pollution. Many people would start to complain about the noise level the windmills create. Many people would want to get rid of them and then it would be a waste of money. Another big risk factor would be turbine lightning damage. if lightning were to hit the turbine it would cause it to explode and that would cause the surrounding turbines to explode to ending in a big firey explosion.]]>

Using a wind turbine does create clean energy, there is no denying that, but it ruins other enviorments that they are built in. Take for exmaple if a company built their turbines in a foresty area. In order to build those turbines they must clear acres of land just to put the infrustructure for the turbines down. While creeating this energy does not create all of the polution or radioactive waste it does hurt the habitats of animals that live in that section of the woods. Also since these are only being built in rural areas where there is not enough electricity it cause humans top move to these once isolated areas. The turbines create enough energy to power areas that normaly do not have any electricity, because they dont have any electricity no one lives in those areas. But if these wind farms are able to generate enough power for 12 million homes then whats to stop millions more from movng into tose areas. Eventually we would overrun those areas and basically ruin the enviorment some more.]]>

Noise pollution can be solved if you build the wind turbines somewhere were there is no wildlife and far away from human life like in grasslands in hills. That way endagered wildlife and migrating birds wont be affected. And we really don't use grasslands or hills that much to build buildings so why not build a few wind turbines to make energy. This way also wont affect forests,buildings,and other human made stuctures. We can also put them close to the ocean shorelines since there is always wind blowing around that area that way wind turbines can make energy 24/7.]]>

First of all, not every location is ideal for producing wind power, and even in windy places the wind is never a constant resource. Secondly, wind turbines often mar the rural landscape, as they are usually big, ugly, and noisy, generating as much noise as a small jet engine. Obstructions in the landscape also damage the effectivity of wind power, and the turbine power is not always a dependent source. On top of all that, turbines are dangerous to the avian species that might fly into them, which include many species of migrating birds and endangered wildlife. Lastly, the turbines themselves are not safe from damage; lightning strikes can damage the blades and render the wind farm unusable.]]>

There are many places where the wind might not come everyday and cause a brown out and then that area has no other source of power at the moment. The only type pollution that gets created is noise pollution. It may not affect the enviorment but it does affect those living around it which leads to either moving the wind farms away from the civilization, which may or may not have the same wind speeds, or having people move away if they are bothered by it. Another downside is the size of the windmill blades. Most of the time they are really big and cause obstruction to multiple things. They are also endangering wildlife, birds may fly through on of it scares away the animals that were living in that area. It can also ruin the view of a place and the tourist attreaction may go down beacuse the only thing they see are wind farms.]]>

Once these blades are spinning, they create so much noise that it is impossible for the areas around the windmills to be populated. This also counts for the wildlife animals, which lived in the areas before windmills were to be constructed there. Since windmills are constructed often on hills, mountains, deserted areas, the wildlife has no only been chased away from the loud noises of the blades but also because of the construction that seems displased and not appealing to the surrounding environment. Migrating birds, for example, could be chased away because of the windmills's loud and disturbing noises which could scare away animals. Windmills are not pleasant for people living close eaither. even though most energy windmills are far away from populated places, there are mills near farms. They create &quot;noise polution&quot;.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Using windmills to create electricity is not a new technoloy. However, modern methods of creating power through turbines proves to have several drawbacks when considering environmental reprecussions. As a result, utilizing wind energy as a source of electricity is a poor use of rural land. The emerging technology of electricity-generating windmills involve a massive set of blades, much like wings, that can cause damage to the environment and impact scenery. A large amount of space is required in order to construct a wind farm in the first place, as any obstructions entirely sabotage the construction of wind turbines. Construction of modern wind turbines also ruin the aesthetic of rural areas due to their unappealing, large design. These huge blades generate electricity, but they also generate deafening amounts of noise, disturbing the relative peace of the environment. The turbines themselves also cause noise pollution that further disturbs the surroundings. In addition, the spinning blades endager migrating birds and other animals, due to the turbine possibly interrupting migration by colliding with airborne animals. Efficiency of wind power must also be taken into account, as many characteristics of wind power leave it liable to failure. Wind does not blow all the time, as weather dictates, and thus a sustainable amount of electricity might not be generated. Turbine power also varies by 25%, in comparision to wind speed, which varies by 10%. Lightning can easily strike turbines down and prevent smooth functioning, further hampering wind turbine efficiency.]]>

Even in places in the U.S. where the wind blows constantly it is still not enough to have giant wind mills. Also it is virtually impossible to determine how fast the wind will blow. Wind speeds are never the same. The slower the wind speed the less power generated by the turbine. I personally know what its like to live in an area with wind mills and I gotta admit at first its a fascinating site. There are hundreds of wind mills not far from the town I live in. We live in the desert so there isnt much wildlife being endangered and the wind mills really arent in the way of anything. But it does get boring driving by and seeing nothing but giant wind mills.]]>

We can't always rely on wind power because there may not be enough wind energy 24/7. Sometimes when I walk outside I feel no wind or very little wind. There may be some people in the U.S. that use electricity from this source but it is a small percentage and I don't think producing energy using wind can be enough for everyone in the planet let alone a country. There are also a lot of man-made buildings and forests and mountains which cn cause a resistance and allow very little wind to pass through to where in needs to go to produce energy. Those who help produce wind energy use windmills and these windmills can be noisy and can put some wildlife in danger, for example migrating birds can accidentally get severly injured or even die if they get caught or hit on one of the blades from the windmills. Windmills are also too big and are an ugly design which can ruin rural landscaping.]]>

For instance, the windmills turn into the wind to make energy though, their blades connected to their small jet engine causes much disruption in the environment. Whether being their big turbines which, ruins beautiful rural landscapes or even thier blades that are too noisy. In contrast, natural gas or even oil has proved to be less destrustive to environments. Those two power resources haven't endangered wildlife as windmills do nor hurt migrating birds but, they have proved to be nothing but, effective and good power sources. As people that keep society going, working citizens even, they rely on transportation. And its apparent in technology that it'll be simply abusrb to rely on just wind power. Its almost as if relying on the unknown for wind comes and it goes. Moreover, wind speed varies by 10%. Now we do have the resouces available to predict the weather forecast but, even that isn't always correct. So, to rely soley on wind production would a mere guessing game becuase, you couldn't exaclty pinpoint wind speed but can give vague generalities. Unlike gas whereas though some energy is lost to heat most of it is used and, one could get a closer estimate on how much energy they have or need. To take a case in point if you needed more energy or gas for whatever reason you can go get more fuel by paying a small price. However, consider a society that ran on just wind energy you couldn't get more energy but, had to depend on the weather and living in California where the weather varies constantly it wouldn't be productive.]]>

Imagine having an open fan, then throwing paper through the back of it, what will happen to the paper? Of course the paper would be smacked. Now replace the paper with a bird, what will happen to that bird? The bird would be smacked and dead, along with other birds that followed that bird. It endages flying wildlife especially endagered wildlife. These leads to the problem of strutures around these windmills. Nobody who lives who works around the windmills would want to see dead birds all around the grass, I wouldn't want to see that. In addition that dead birds, it could create a jam in the mills if the birds were to get inside.

Even if we construct wind turbines everywhere, the blades would create an immense amount of noise so living around them would prove to be a challenge because there woud never be any peace and quiet. Another challenge would be, where would we place them, there are too many obstructions due to wind turbines requiring too much space, to build them we would need to destroy more forests to create enough space. If we destroy forests, then we would destroy the habitats of many birds and animals, which could lead to endagerment of several species.]]>

Wind energy does not blow 24/7 it is a disadvantage because Americans used the wind energy to generate electricity in rural areas, that lacked on electric services. Wind energy has environmental impacts from using noisy blades which disturbed peace and could disturbed animals, turbines were also built too big, and weredesigned to be very ugly, it could even ruin rural landscape. To use this wind energy it must be in a free and in abundance and in certain areas but by it being in a nature space such at forests, and mountains it could harm creatures, even palnts because of how strongly it generates the wind. With a wind speed of 10% which can increase highly in the turbine by 25% and cause many incidents such as endangering wild life like migrating birds. But if these turbines are placed in other man-made structures near mankind it can affect us too not only wild life but human life through lightning damage, and noise pollution which can annoy us and lead us to be cranky all the time thus causing us humans to react in a negative way.]]>

Although they do not create waste, they accessibility and usage of these wind turbines is not constant, and therefore cannot be counted on as a strong, reliable source. Wind occurs naturally, and will not always be blowing, so the energy guaranteed depends on the weather, which is constantly changing. Wind turbines cannot be built in any given area, they require an open area with high winds, and can be obstructed by such abundantly occuring objects as forests, mountains, buildings, and any other structures which could block the natural flow of wind. Also, wind turbines are ugly, making them stand out in the natural settings where they are placed. They can obstruct the migration patterns of birds and other wildlife. The disadvantages of wind power far outweigh the advantages, and we are better off using other, more reliable forms of energy.]]>

It could be the noise, the design, the dangers that it has on nature or even that the windmill isnt blowing all the time. It has been proven that during two am in the moring that is when most of the windmills reached there maximum goal of producing engery. The problem is that no one is awake around that time to use that engery is it is stored until it needs to be used. Then to top that it has also became a danger to nature due to birds migrating. Yes this is a way to produce clean engergy but this are reasons that you cannot look over. Either two things must happen. One improve the design so they are not a hazard to nature and produce energy all the time. Or just get rid of the windmills. It is that simple.]]>

Even though wind energy is would be more cleaner source to use it has it negative affects. Not everyone is able to buy a Wind Power generator. Wind energy is helpful to the enviroment but it endangers wildlife. A specie that is highly hurt are then birds. Birds migrate from place to place when the season changes. When they are flying to their destination they can hit a Wind Power and die. Birds most of the time can't recognze Wind Power to move out the way so they end up hitting themseleves with it. While Wind Power can be benefit us it can endager our bird specie. Wind is not in all place. In order for a Wind Power energy ro work you need air all the time. In some places you don't get wind at all or you get very little. In some places it just rain so Wind Power wouldn't work their. Having Wind Power in cities wouldn't be a goood idea because of all the bulding we already have. It would create a hazard. In California for example you get little wind so it wouldn't be useful.]]>

If you build one near homes or places of work the blades of the windmills or turbines are too noisy to live around. It also hurts the environment since it takes up alot of space to build one or even many which is a wind farm. They endanger birds that fly by and not notice that the winmills are there.]]>

Wind energy, you can always get it but does it blow all day? Or will it give you a headache? Or will you someday see a lot of dead birds on your front lawn? These are a few of the disavantages that wind energy has to offer. Windmills are a great source of energy but it still needs a lot of improvement to be done to make it perfect. If you had seen a windmill, you can see that they are very tall, make loud noises and that their design looks like a tall steel stick with twirling pedals. They create energy but people still have a problem with it. The people who has windmills as their view whenever they look out the window, think that the turbines are too large, and its design is far from beautiful. Other complains are that it makes loud noises and it make you annoyed. Also for the birds who migrate seemed to be in danger because of the windmills. A bird may not know what these strange machines are when the blades are running, the bird may get suck in and get killed. The next day, you may see piles of dead birds on your lawn or around the windmill. It endangers wildlife. Some days you have those windy days and others the wind is gone--at the moment.Windmills generates by the wind and the blades can't move without the wind pushing it. The problem is that the wind doesn't blow all day and people need energy to wash their clouds, or turn on the light or anything that you do with energy. When the wind does blow, it needs to be powerful enough. The wind's speed usually goes 10% but the turbine power varies by 25%. At times like these, you can't always rely on wind energy because it may not be powerful enough to generate the blades. There are many ways wind energy could be great but there are still lots of improvement to be done.]]>

Some areas recieve very little, if any, wind during the during the summer. The summer is a time of intense heat in more rural areas. Without out wind there is no electricity and that can be a danger in dry heat. Infants and elderly are at a higher risk of heat related deaths. With a constant source of energy heat related deaths can be lowered with the ability to turn on the air conditioning or call to for help. Although wind power is better the earth, it is not as reliable and can be a health hazard.]]>

Harnessing the wind to generate energys may have been a viable option a hundred or more years ago, when energy production methods such as nucleur power were still extremely underdeveloped or not even concieved of yet. However, in this day and age wind energy proves to be uneffective and unreliable. The main issue with wind energy is that it is not something that can be controlled, as the wind obviously does not blow every hour of every day of every year. Other technologies like nucleur power can be controlled, and can be harnessed at any time as long as the plant is operational. This lack of control results in an unsteady flow sof electricity, and is possible of failing when it is needed the most. Another issue is the environmental impact. While many lobbyists for wind energy may argue that it has very little or no impact on the environment, this is not true. They are large and bulky, capable of disturbing the natural environment of an organism. The spinning blades that generate the energy are also a large hazard. Any animal unlucky enough to fly through one of the turbines will have absolutely no chance of surviving, and this can be very dangerous for large migratory groups, especially when the area has many turbines present. Somewhat less negative are the aesthetic effect, or lack thereof, of the turbines. Designs for these machines are often as utilitarian as possible, sacrificing any pleasing design for the most energy that can possibly be produced. When large numbers of these ugly devices are set togethor, on what is called a wind farm, they often completely ruin the natural beauty of the location. Even if they somehow fit in with the locale, the noise they produce is bad enough, equivalent to a small jet engine. Combined with their environmental detriments, the many negative aspects of wind turbines render them an unprefferable choice for our evolving energy technology.]]>

Clearly, wind power is generated by the wind, which means that it will not be blowing 24 hours a day. Depending on a location, it is not promised that wind energy will be successsful in all homes. Wind Power can only generate 10% varies as opposed to turbine power which is at 25%. In any case, the very, few places where wind is blowing 24/7 would be for example, on the shoreline or on top of a hill. Also, Turbines, that come as enormous and with unsuccessful designs will ruin rural landscapes. Their noisy blades will create noise pollution as opposed to a small jet engine that a windmill produces. But both machines, will contribute more to the endangered wildlife since they are destroying and taking the place of forests and mountains. Man-made structures are also a distraction to migrating birds and can cause them to dismiss their fights in order to survive harsh winters and seasons.]]>

The blades connect to a drive shaft that turns an electric generator to produce electricity, which makes them very noisy. Theirs no possible way for them to be quiet which makes the huge blades a problem for most people living around the wind turbines. The noise pollution is a huge problem for the wind farms and because of the small jet engine their is no way to turn it off. Wind energy has tons of pros but for every pro their is 20 more cons. Turbines are too big, they're design is ugly to some people and they ruin rural landscape. They cause a lot of obstruction, you could be in the middle of a beautiful forest, or somewhere in the mountains and you'll find a windmill which will ruin the vibe. They also endanger wildlife, migrating birds might fly into them on accident, and obviously get crushed because of how much power the windmill has. Wind speed varies by 10% and turbine power varies by 25%, so you never know how fast your windmill will go which is a huge problem for some. If its not going fast enough, it won't generate enough energy to power anything.]]>

If that's the case, we might have to waste money, and build wind generators or turbines to put in front of the windmill, just to keep it running steady all day, everyday. Windmills and turbines are also noisy, which can be a problem for many, such as animals and people. If they're placed on a hill, the sound they create can be a problem for the suurounding neighborhood or shopping centers, you name it.

Windmills work by the wind flowing over the blades creating lift causing them to lift and rotate. in just 2012 wind turbines in the United States generated about 3% of the nations electryicty which comes up to about 12 million households being powered. Even though wind power has many perks, such as it does not generate pollution or consume any type of non-renewable resources, it still has its disadvantages. There are multiple disadvantages to use wind turbines because the wind is not blowing 24/7, noisy blades, endagered wildlife and turbine lightning damage. If one day it is windy but the next the day the air is as still as stone the turbines will not generate and form of electricity because the blades are not turning therefore no creating electricity. Noisy blades can also be a problem because it disturbes the homes of who surround it which can create a malestrom of conflict. Birds migrate every year and if turbines block the passage of which the bird migrates it may hurt the birds which pass through them. If one day there is a large thunder storm with mass lightning the wind turbines will be the items that get struck for being the tallest object in an open feild. The use of wind turbines should not be overlooked for it has many hazards]]>

Windmills in the end will only create a fuss with neighbors and un-neighborly welcomes. Windmills have noisy blades, causing families without a windmills getting distracted, lack of sleep due to the noise coming from the over-sized fans going outside their homes. Neighbors may have to consider moving because of their neighbor has a windmill. But what if the family does not have the money to move? The family, the workers in the home, are going to have a lack of sleep for the work day. With lack in sleep, the workers are going to go to work exhausted, tired mind, and slowed down for their lack of sleep, and with their lack in working behavior, that person is going to have to explain their home enivorment, with the windmill just next door. Maybe even their boss/manager is going to even tell them,&quot;I do not care about what your home situation is, you come to my restaurant, store, saloon,salon,etc, in working condition, well-mannered mood, and smile to greet MY customers or you will be gone.&quot; Not all managers/bosses are kind hearted about your situation, they care about their business, with or without you. Not only are windmills noisy, the turbines are too big, the design is ugly, and the rural landscape is ruined. With the turbines too big, it destroys the rural landscape. Now why would anybody want to go destroy mother nature to get what they want. If windmills were meant to be on the landscape, don't you think they would be there? Yea, don't think so. Windmills are man-made and not by nature. We already destroyed the outdoors with skyscrapers, factores, malls, huge un-needed building to get what we want, not thinking twice about what it may do to our enivorment.]]>

But, what people fail to recognize is wind energy has many more disadvantages. for example, the large collection of windmills do not blow twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, it has noisy blades, and the turbines are too big-- ruining rural landscape, according to my credible sources. They represent more of a model that takes up space in land that could be used for other projects. These windmills also obstruct forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures that do impact all of our communities in a positive way. These windmills are not of much use, due to the fact the wind speed varies by 10% and turbine power varies by 25%-- that is only when the windmills are blowing. Apart of not being of much use, they have also turbine light damage and noise pollution. And last but not least, this wind energy technology endangers wildlife-- for example, migrating birds.]]>

Wind turbines have massive blades that produce a lot of noise pollution so the surrounding communities would have to suffer with constent noise that they are not normally used to. Wind turbines are normally placed in spots that get in the way of migrating birds, which can lead to endagering that species if extent enough. Also, wind turbines do not blow 24/7 so they are not as reliable of a source of energy such as coal or natural gas. Wind power is a good idea but until methods inprove and grow, wind turbines are more of burden to the community than helpful.]]>

Windmills cost over $15,000 a piece. That is not very &quot;cost friendly.&quot; For the amount of money they are worth they should all be running 24/7. How often when you drive through a windmill farm do you see every windmill on? Not very often. The reason not all of them are on is because birds fly right into them. Not very friendly to the enviroment, especially in the state of California. I agree if wind was a cheap source of energy it might work. But it's just too expensive. Its too much money to charge taxpayers for windmills when only one out of three will be on at a time. Then again the government flushes money down the toilet left and right so whats another 100 million dollars.]]>

For the blades being very noisey it causes people to not want to be around that area where they are, which makes the towns population and tourism go down which effects the economy of the town a lot. With the economy being down in the town, the town will slowly start to get run down and they wont be able to afford to run the wind energy any more. Another negative bout the wind energy is the urbines will be to big and unapeling. With the turbines being unapealing that also might be a take away for tourism for the community they are in.

Wind can be unreliable, blowing only sometimes and not generating enough power to make it worth the effort. They can not only effect the migration of birds, but also kill them. Noise pollution is also a large problem, since wind mills are not quiet by any stretch of the imagination. The turbines take up too much space to be pratical and require large plots of land that could otherwise be used, as well as serve as obstructions. There is just too much variation for it to be a feasible long term source of energy-as much as 25%! Wind energy may be useful in small doses, but it should not be the only one used.]]>

Even if the intesions are for windmills not to polute the enviroment they already are by creating the windmills.

First, the fact that the wind does not blow continuesly most aptly supports this view. There are times when strong wind might pass by a wind trubine farm and generate enough electricity for houses. However, this is not the case for many times. We can not control the wind to where we want it to go, or how strong we want it to blow on the turbines. Therefore there will be days when there are no wind at all. What are we going to do when those days come? Second, wind turbines are enormous, and a farm of wind turbine would atleast take up a whole area of animal inhabitants. Many say that by creating these wind turbines, we could potentially save the planet and the animals from global warming and pollution. However, taking away the homes of many species for electricity coulf do more harm to the planet than to help it.]]>

There are many downfalls to wind power even though they do not consume any non-renewable rewsources. Us humans can not control the wind but we can react to it. The point of having these windmills is to have them in an area where there are no obstructions and high concentration of wind currents so they can be proven effective to our society.

Not only is wind power not an 100% eco-friendly option, but it also adds an unwanted unattractive look to surrounding areas.It can easily cause any population of birds to go extinct with its large blades that can easily kill the air beast. While it may significantly reduce AIR pollution, it adds another, more annoying, kind of pollution: noise pollution. The turbines, that are a widely suggested tool, may as well be the reason for loud noises people would have to endure, which isn't fair for the citizens there LONG before jet-engine-like wind machines. One major problem with wind energy is that people may need electricity/ energy at multiple times in the day and night. Because there is no 24/7 wind energy, people will be at a loss when they cannot use energy at a time they may need it. If wind energy blows mostly during the day time, then at night, a child will have no night light or a student finishing up their online homework will have no means of completing it. If the wind were to blow mostly at night, however, people during the day time would be completely lost. Men and women on their daay time commute would be in trouble. Children at schools would have limited learning means. In this century, electricity rules our lives and a less than 24/7 means of electricity wont work for us. Nor will a loud or ugly means of electricity. We can chose another method or stick to our current method but this method is NOT the best one]]>

As a clean and renewable energy, wind energy certainly creates less pollution and is more sustainable than other forms of energy like coal, natural gas or oil. However, although wind energy becomes more and more important for a green society, there are some disadvantages of wind energy we must consider before we use it in our daily life. First of all, wind--especially high-speed wind--does not exist everywhere. Wind is only abundant in certain areas such as shoreline, the top of a hill, or an open empty space. High-speed wind rarely exists in densely-populated areas such as the cities and suburbs. That being said, wind energy must be first transported hundreds of miles to our homes before we use it. Therefore, a certain amount of energy will be wasted during the process of transportation. Similarly, wind does not always blow continuously at the same speed. If wind energy is not sufficient enough to provide energy at any hour of the day, then it would be a hugh issue when people are in a desparate need of electricity. On the other hand, wind energy is not 100% eco-friendly. The size of those turbines that are used to generate wind energy is enormous. The momentum of the turbines can kill hundreds of birds that accidentally fly through. At the same time, since these turbines are mostly constructed in the nature, they might be obstructions or even the damage to the environment. Turbines might take the place of the habitats of some animals. Therefore, wildlifes could be potentially endangered. As a result, wind energy should be given enough thoughts and be well-developed before its actual application.]]>

Why I chose this first effect is because the wind does not come and go all day or night. Also the turbines are too big causing it not to rotate as much as not producing any energy. Lastly, I chose this effect because the building of the wind energy can cause the birds or any wildlife to migrate from their homes.]]>

One of the main reasons is because it causes noise pollution. It may not be as dangerous as air pollution but it is still pollution. The turbines that are moved by air, are very big and not presentable. If they are placed on a very beautiful peace of land it would make it look ugly. Windmills look old and rusty. no color or or anything nice about it. Also, the turbines endanger the wildlife, especially birds. since birds are the main animals that fly very high in the sky, they can be caught by one of the turbines and get killed. The percentage of bird deaths can start increasing and before you know it, birds will become #1 species. Overall, windmills can be great but not for many reasons. we should be wiser and not use windmills.]]>

These windmills are designed to save energy, reduce pollution, and allow areas to generate energy strictly from just wind fource. Alothough, windmills are a way for the enviorment to not only save energy and reduce the use of harmfull wastes, such as, coal, natural gasses and oil, however, there are negative side effects to the construction of windmills and the affects afterward, also in a fast developing society, windmills may not be officent to all parts of the country. When wind farms are made, it requiers large areas of land for construction, which leads to furthure consequences due to the construction of these large fans. When large areas of land are reserved for wind farms, wild life that used to use that land for a source of shelter are now required to finds a new source of shelter. This can cause some animals to become endangered, due to their lack of shelter. However, it is not only the animals living on the land, it is the birds in the scy that are also being affected. The windmills are disrupting their migration paternes, which can cause bird to go endangered or native birds to flee away from their native areas, causing affects to other regions. The constructiobn will cause land loss and large amounts of trees to be cute down due to construction. This again will causing a negative effects to the wild life that live under the trees and within the trees, causing animals to become endangered. The large amount of land for construction of the windmills is more of a negative effect to the land and wild life than a positive effect. With cites constantly expanding and advancing, windmills will not fit in, or keep up with the standors of a developing society. These windmill farms cause excessive amounts of noise that cites aready produce. Also cities are expanding at rapid rates, so the land that is left needs to be preserved for wild life and viewing perpouses. Furthure generations should have the ability to view open lands without seeing large wind farms. The terbins disrupt the natural beauty of nature due to their ugly structors and loud noises. Also the mills are not always spinning due to the fact that there is not always wind, causing the effect that energy will not always be produced. Windmills are not only a waste of production but a waste of precious land that could be viewed for beauty purposes.]]>

Scientists need to fully develope a system so we can use it for everyday use without using electric power. Electricity is a sure go when it comes to powering up machinery or technology. Wind power would be great but wouldnt be as strong as the electrical power. Planes need to get to point A to point B in a matter of time with the necessities of what it has on the plane; if for some reasons the wind powered plane gets cut short of fuel then people will suffer the conesequences.

A huge problem that is consistently causing problems with wind energy is that we can't control the wind. We don't know whether it's going to be windy or not. This creates a large factor in why wind energy cannot be used as a primary energy source. A civil problem that wind power has is that the turbines are ugly, they ruin a landscape, and the blades are very noisy. This leads to things like heavy noise pollution during otherwise quiet times. It also creates a large wild life hazard. The blades on the turbines are very dangerous to migrating birds and also act as lighting rods. This makes it extremely easy for wild fires to occur especially during dryer seasons.]]>

It can generate enough energy for a large number of people and generate about 12 million households. Eventhough it is cheaper and more efficient than some other energy sources, it also has its advantages. Wind energy is extremely beneficial to have in windy areas. However not all areas are constantly windy, or for that matter genertae any wind at all. if they were to build windmills in areas that have little to no wind, it would not be beneficiary. Also if we were to make room for all the large turbines, it would disrupt habitats in the act of creatimg enough space for these windmills]]>

The wind farms are large and can take up the rich furtle farming soil, ruin the beauty of a mountain side, forces the destruction of forests to build a wind farm and it obstructs beautiful views.As well as the turbines that come with the windmill. Who wants to sit there and stare at a distasteful turbine? The turbines also have that dangerous attraction to lightning which could entirely ruin all the windmills and turbines in the farm. Another problem with the Windfarms is noise pollution. It sounds like a jet engine is about to take off. A human wouldn't want to hear that 24/7 The wind also doesn't blow 24/7 in certain areas it does but like most it only blows a few hours a day causing the windmill to be virtually pointless. Even the wind speeds vary they don't blow 100 miles per hour every day. If they are not properly taken care of they can rust because they are man made and all man made things do break eventually causing that horrible screeching noise when they turn. A main reason that wind farms are a bad idea is because they endanger the life of migrating birds and other flying wildlife. A little bird couldn't fly though a wind farm and survive; those ginormous spinning blades will indefinatly maime or even kill that poor bird who was probably just looking for a worm. These are just a few key points on why wind farms are not a good idea.]]>

Someone could get hurt if they live by them. It wont give us the power all the time. Their is not always wind, so what that means is we wont get the energy all the time. People dont want their power to go out they want to have it all the times. Turbines are not the solution to have. The new technology will help us, in all that we need.]]>

The wind doesn't blow with the consistency required for a stable power source. Even when the wind is blowing, the speed can vary by as much as 10%, which results in turbine power varying by a quarter. The turbines also create a lot of irritating noise, with larger wind farms being as potentially loud as a jet engine. The shape of the wind mill can also act as a giant lightning rod in the middle of an open area. Lightning striking the wind mill could have disasterous, costly effects. Wind mills are also difficult to place. In larger cities, structures such as skyscrapers or other buildings obstruct the wind. On the other hand, in rural areas, the striking contrast between the tall, rigid form of the wind mill and the serenity of the natural landscape is ruinous, aesthetically. The only other option would be to put wind mills in smaller cities, but the intensity of the noise pollution would mean a strong public united against the idea. The wind mills can also be harmful, if not lethal, to endangered wildlife, such as migrating birds.]]>

It can be difficult to power cities with wind farms due to the lack of places to put them, free of obstructions. Also the power generated by wind turbines isn't consistent, because of either the wind not blowing all the time, or the turbine's power variance. Many people are also opposed to wind farms because of how they look. Sometimes cities do not want wind farms near them because they are thought to ruin the landscape. Another reason why wind farms aren't liked is because wind turbines produce a lot of noise, with whole wind farms being about as loud as a small jet engine.]]>

It has been used formany things but now it has been a phenominom to use this windmills as a energy source which is a good thing and eco friendly to the enviorment, but also had its disadvanteges. If the growing population had windmills in consideraton having in mind that not always will there be enought wind the blaides can be noisy, and they can be an abstruction to nature. Each day we have different weather all around the world. in some place it can be bright and sunny while at the oppisite side of the world can be cloudy. having this in mind not everyday will there be suffficiant wind to have the windmills running.If not suficiant strong wind is available the windmills will be no use but there will be days where wind is more than enought to keep these windmills spinning producing electrical power of other usage. Another thing to keep in mind is that the wind speed varies by 10% and turbines will varie by 25%. Lots of wind is necisary to make this plan of windmills to work. Another reason why not to hacve windmills is because it can be desturbing to the enviornment. Just like a colorful plastic windmill one would play when little, a real energy source windmill will function the same as the toy. when wind is been blown into it the blades will start to rotait in a circular motion that can make lound noise. Some might ingnore it and go on with their everyday life, but spme people will find it very disturbing and might not thing that this is a good idea. Finaly a windmill will take space where natural life can be growing. For instance in the middle of a forest where a tree can replace its step or home to a family of owles, or a bulding where one can make of a home or a buisness out of it. all in all the pricing to make this plan can be pricy and there is not enough space for natural resources and manmade matchines to be in the same place.]]>

Turbines can also obstruct the flight patterns of birds if the turbines are right in the flight pth of migrating birds. Noise pollution can also come from wind farms.

There's a lot of noise pollution due to the jet motor connected to the turbine, this gives it quite some speed. They kill plenty of birds annually and can damage the machine. The Noise is also really annoying, some scientists say it makes people go insane. During lightnins storms, since it's a giant metal object sticking out from our earth, it is likely target for the lightning. it takes up space and obstructs our envoirment. Who decieded on the design it's unappealing and makes people NOT want to have them. There's also leakage from the motor when damaged that can destroy the surrounding landscape. Thus making them unworthy of our time, it's too much to maintence, though they seem cheap the repairs make up for the cost and would most likely put the owner in debt! ???]]>

No longer are the educated able to strive foreward and continue their education at an advanced pace; rather, we must all as a whole succumb to the demise of average. The educated will be bored. Those who struggle will become frustrated and enraged and the average will be uncomfortable at the sight of the fighting views. Our society will be killed by the waste of time that is becoming an education system where teacher and student views are ignored and thus, saving the surrounding landscape is irrelevent. A small jet engine is far to noisy, and thus a wind farm would be too. We the people need the sound of silence in nature to distract from the protests of those who dissagree with the arragent blowhards who have to much power in our government. How dare some envirementalist suggest that we waste time saving the land that allows us to live. More importantly, these designs are ugly, which would so obviously clash with the decaying bodies of animals ravaged by Americas currently used crude oil spills and polution. There is a risk of lightening damage and we as a society of omnipotent gods should not have to succumb to the risks of mere nature. Finally, we should not have to deal with the inconvienience of these monstrosities getting in the way of our man made structures. The concept of saving the planet which we owe so much to, in fact our very existance, is proposterous considering our society of compassion, intelligience and hope will be extinct. I can only hope this response is published, I hope with all of my being that Jerry Brown and the other education-killing polititions see this in newspapers and in the news. Have fun killing our future society.]]>

Well the answer is that they are placed in places where one can't see them places where we are harmed unknowningly, but as the saying goes out of site out of mind. Picture a beautiful forrest where the birds churp and the moss grows wild where lies true serenity. Places like this are getting harder and harder to find due to the abundance of windmills placed all around the nation for energy consumption. Large construction crews go into forrest to destroy the natural beauty for their own personal malevalance and greed. This should stop not only for us but for the planet that we are harming.]]>

The mere function of a wind turbine exudes the sound and volume of a jet engine, disturbing wildlife and human occupants alike. Aside from noise pollution, wind turbines also often contradict the rural setting they must be placed in, and obstruct any chance for consistancy in a given location. Wind turbines also require extremely specific conditions to operate at optimal capacity: the surrounding landscape must be virtually barren of obstructions, and even then, wind is never constant in any location. There is also the issue of weather variance. Wind turbines are too cumbersome to relocate in the event of a large storm, and the required conditions for efficient functionality of wind turbines leaves them exposed to the elements. Although they can be cleaner and cheaper than other energy sources, wind turbines are for too fickle and obtuse to be utilized on a large scale.]]>

Its been recorded that in 2012 wind turbines in the united states generated about 3% of total U.S electricityor the equivalent of about 12 million households. first of all the turbines are not created for fashion or impression so it doesnt matter if theyre ugly or not thats not the focus on them. they are not here for a anyone to be impressed they are here for living purposes. yes they are big but look how much electricty people use those are much needed. Ugly design? well if it was based on looks than im sure they would have updated them but thats not what they are made for so it doesnt matter how they look.]]>

However, they aren't as safe, and efficient as people deem them to be. For example, birds are constatntly migrating from one location to another, and these wind turbines are high up in the air, in birds reach. If birds aren't being alert, especially the younger ones in a flock, the wind turbines, while spinning, will kill them off. This is a significant threat to bio-diveristy in the area, which could potentially put certain species on the endangereds list. Moreover, these wind turbines produce noise pollution, which then disturbs the people living in that area, as well as the animals.]]>

One of the major ways society can create this change is through the production of clean energy. Rather than burning carbon fuels and releasing gasses into the atmosphere that destroy or ozone layer, we have found ways to harvest energy from the forces of nature. A seemingly popular method to harness this energy is through windmills. However, the reality of the implementations of the windmill is not all that it is chalked up to be. There are multiple defects to the windmill. The major flaw in this design is that wind is not a constant force. It varies greatly with weather patterns, and does not even always blow in the same direction. Even if it is the windiest day of the year, if the wind is not hitting your windmill head on then the amount of energy absorbed will be greatly reduced. Not only is the windmill unreliable, it de-beautifies nature and our communties. When the blades do catch the wind, they tend to make a lot of noise. No one wants to plant a big and ugly windmill in their front yard that will create constant noise pollution along with damaging the image of their house.]]>

For example it has very nosiy blades so it can be a disturbance for families or people who live near it. Also they are so big and usually have an ugly design; therefore windmills often times ruin rural landscape and the beauty there. Another reason why windmills are not good is because they endanger wildlife such as migrating birds. There are many other negative effects from windmills therfore they should not be used.]]>

How effective are these wind energy mills exactly, if they cannot run 24/7? Considering the fact that wind power is available virtually anywhere like rural areas, its loud motors cause disruption to a peaceful environment. Windmills are also eyesores as they look and appear to be obstructions blocking landscapes.Not to mention the migrating birds that come acorss these mills may get misled by landing on these electrical currents. Not only would the birds get electricuted but also wildlife in general is put in risk by implementing a machine that is seen as unatural. With local farmers living nearby, it is without a doubt noise pollution to them. It sounds like jet engine that could drive others wild and away from rural lands. Windmills destroy the true beauty of land.]]>

Over the last decade, wind energy has become one of the most cost-effective emerging technologies.

We also cannot always count on there being wind and unless we could create reserve power, if it was not windy for several weeks we could have mass power outages. Another problem would be creating power in areas with geological obstructions like forests, mountains, buildings and other large man made structures. Ontop of all that, if you dont care about the ugly landscape ruining massive windmills that would litter the enviroment, or the noise dispuption, the animals would be put in danger.

The wind may be a green cost efficient way of gaining energy, but the wind is not blowing every second. The wind might only be whistling by for a few hours or even a few seconds. It is an unpredictable pattern that is not very efficient. Energy needs to be reliable all the time. Wind turbines can not provide this. Along with the wind not blowing all the time, when it is windy outside, the wind might not be as strong as it could be. the wind speed varies by 10% while the turbine power varies by 25%. The wind turbines are not the most attractive things to look at. The turbines are massive white structures that can be visible from a far distance away. The turbines do not blend in well with the enviorment because of there design. This makes the landscape not as natural. Along with the look of the turbines in nature, the turbines could effect the wildlife in the are. Birds might get caught on one of the roating blades, the turbines might be built on some of the wildlifes home habitats. There are many good uses for using wind turbines for a source of energy, but there are alot of negatives that have to be looked at as well when deciding on whether to go along with this massive project or not.]]>

The primary use of windmills is to generate energy, and many claim that it is an extremely effective source; it may be at times, however the wind does not blow every hour of the day, and its speed varies by 10%, while the turbine power varies by 25%. In addition to its inconsistent effectiveness, the blades themselves have been known to be very noisy, and the turbines are far too large with an unappealing design which ruins the image of the rural landscape. Aside from the image of windmills as well as their effectiveness, the usage of Wind Energy has several faults by its effects upon nature as well as nature's effects upon itself. Due to the large sturcuture of windmills as well as their placement in high altitudes, windmills have recieved turbine lightning damage, which may or may not greatly effect their cost for repair and efficiency. It has also been noted that they have endagered wildlife especially those of migrating birds, that may be obstructed by the large turbines.]]>

For that reason most Windmill blades are set up in unpopulated areas because of the amount of noise and space it needs.Not only does it disturb humans, but it can disturb the wildlife in that area. Migrating birds can accidently hit it while flyimg.Overall it is a great invention, because wind will blow no matter what, we might aswell use it to our advantage.We just have to be aware of the consequences it can have on daily life.]]>

Similarily, even though it is considered better for the enviornment, the turbines are too big with ugly designs which can ruin rural landscapes. People travel from different areas all around the world just to see some landscapes, but to only be dissapointed by the turbines that cover up all the wonders of it.

One flaw in Wind Power is the idea that wind will not be blowing all day, every day. Wind Power is only produced through the amount of wind blown through the windmill baldes. Thus when there is a point in time where there is a stalemate or a long period in which there is no wind; the windmills will not be able to produce enough power. Secondly, the windmills cause an obstruction in the environment around them. Windmills today are massive, in result there needs to be a large space constructed for the windmills to thrive. However there is never a place wide enough to support the amount of windmills that need to be produced. Thus the idea of destroying forests, mountains or other man-made structures is put into play, in order to make way for these monster windmills. By destroying these enviorments it has casued many endangered wildlife. Due to the many destructions of natural habitats in order to make way for windmills, animals who have lived in theses areas have become endangered. By destroying one's home, the animals have become scarce and leads to more and more animals becoming endangered. However, not only by destroying habitats, the windmills have caused a disturbance in the migration of birds. Having massive technology standing tall, it causes birds who migrate have an obstacle that prevents them from returning to their homes as well.]]>

Some of the best places to put a &quot;wind farm&quot; are also the homes to thousands of animals and other wildlife. Demolishing a forest to erect a wind farm could make many animals become endangered or even go extinct. My guess is that no wind power company wants the blood of an entire species on their hands. Wind power also seems like an amazing &quot;long term investment.&quot; Wrong. Guess what places with a lot of wind also have a lot of? That's right, storms. Wind-mill turbines are very expensive and also very conductive so when a storm starts up the first thing to be struck by lightning will be one of those turbines. A broken turbine is not very benefitial to anybody.]]>

One of the problems with this new source of energy is the fact that wind does not blow consistently throughout the day. This variation in wind pattern makes windmills seem unpractical due to the absence of a consistent flow. Without the wind blowing the massive structure is useless. Windmills without wind are just huge ugly turbines that take away rural landscape. Having these built and not used to full capacity endangers nature and the wildlife that lives there. This so called clean source of energy is not as helpful as it seams. Noise pollution is caused by the wind farms that are created and that is just one more thing that disturbs the surrounding areas. The countryside becomes the city with these loud windmills occupying land. Wind energy is nothing but a disadvantage for those who use it.]]>

To begin, wind turbines cannot provide us with energy at all hours of the day. The wind isnt constantly blowing and when it is, it sometimes still isnt strong enough to actually push the turbines and generate electricity. Another problem is that wind trubines require special landscapes, they must be in area where wind is fairly constant and stong and where buildings wont block the wind. They take up rural landscape space. They also pose a threat to migrating birds who can easily be hit by one of the giant blade swinging through the air or get sucked in by the jet engine or simply run into the giant pole standing in the middle of what use to be an open field. Wind turbines can be helpful but pose as a nusince.]]>

For instance, there is no guarantee that wind will be blowing at all hours of the day and obstructions such as forests, mountains, buildings and other man-made structures can decrease turbine efficiency. If wind speeds vary by 10% then turbine power varies by 25%. This huge difference creates abnormalities in energy production and causes wind energy to be unreliable. In addition, the big, ugly design of the turbines disrupt the natural flow of the environment. Migrating birds can fly into the noisy blades and therefore lead to endangering wildlife.

Just because it is a consisstant source doesn't make it the best option. Wind energy is noisy, the turbines take up a lot of space, and is damaging with its obstructions, turbine lightning damage, and even endangering wildlife. With wind motion comes sound. The sound is a noise, bothersome to the people near or around it. If wind power becomes increasingly popular, there will be more and more windmills installed around people's homes, causing chaos. People will complain and even potentially protest. With protests, there could be an end to the windmills, causing the only success being waste of people's times, damaging land, and wasting money the U.S. can't afford, seeing as it is already in billions of dollars of debt. When the windmills are installed, they have to be placed in specific areas, even if it means tearing down mountains or digging into Earth's soil. Connected to the damage of Earth is endangerment of wildlife and endangerment to migrating birds. Wildlife that lives in an area can lose its home to a newly placed windmill for the people of the area. Also, with more wind, it can disrupt the migrators trying to fly freely from one location to another.]]>

Windmills are only there because we need energy and it doesn't mean that we literally need it. It can be good thing and also a bad thing. Windmills also don't blow 24/7 and that means that it can't be needed. Windmills are also noisy for example if you want to a quite place and there's windmills around where you live then it would be hard to get some quite sleep. Windmills can also destroy your neigborhood, for example what if let's say that there's an earthquake and everthings falls out and the windmill of course heavy falls on where you live. Windmills also ruin a good cost of landscape. They take on too much space. Some people would actually need land but due to the windmills taking too much of a landscape it's hard to build what you want to build. And it's too big it waste too much space. It is a wate of time to build a windmills when sometime it can't be use. Lastly windmills move very slow and there's no need for it to be use. If it doesn't move that fast then why use it? Windmills speed varies by 10%-tubrine power varies by 25% which means it is super slow for a big use thing. It can also ruin the enviorment because of all the space it takes up. For example birds won't able to fly around because of how ginormus it is.]]>

First, there is the question of cosmetic appeal. Many turbines are too big and ugly, ruining the astetics of the rural landscape. Turbines can also be obstructions for man-made structures and make a large amount of noise. Therefore, nobody wants to reside near the turbines. Wind turbines generated about 3% of U.S. electricity, but the supply constant. Wind energy could never fully supply all the energy. Turbines are not running all day, they are sometimes stopped for maintenence or for a break. This causes fluctuation in energy supply.]]>

We can't guarantee that the wind speed will be fast enough to create lift thereby turning the blades of the windmill. There are plenty of factors that need to be considered. Back in the 1920's, a windmill was perfect for generating all different types of sources when you place it in the country or near a mountain. Nowadays, it's a mission to find a nice spot to put a windmiill, let alone a wind farm. You have to take into consideration the noise that the blades will create and the other wildlife that inhabit the very same area the wind farm is being placed. It is true that Wind Power is clean and helpful, but can you guarantee that the wind will forever blow where you put the farm? Today, I imagine it is very hard to find a perfect place to put a wind farm, and I have only seen one or two myself in my travels through the U.S.]]>

Also, turbines have noisy blades, cause noise pollution from wind farms with small jet engines, and have a big, ugly design. These structures can also ruin the rural landscape which endagers wildlife and affects the migration of birds. Due to industrialization, many wind turbines will be obstructed by forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures.

Just like everything in life, there is always a positive and negative effect. Wind energy is improving in efficenty and does produce a significant amount of energy, but the effects on the enviornment are not to go unnoticed. Wind turbines are a rotating knives in the sky. Birds migrating or simpily flying by can easily be sucked into the pull of the rotating blades. Never before have birds seen a giant white mill in the sky, and if they are bold enough to check it out, its too late to turn back. As well as the presence in air, the stem from the ground requires that matenance be acessible on a regular basis. The mills have to be built on ground that is somewhat flat. The point of having a rural landscape is to keep it rural. Adding unnaturally white windmills to the beautiful natural landscape will make it no longer completly natural. The urban domination is penetrating the rural life in the first form, disguised in a socially acceptable manner. If the turbines have to be in rural places, the energy they produce has to find a way to the city. Constructuion of underground or above electricity wires would have to be built.]]>

They claim it is abundant and cheap, however the fact remains it is not a viable choice. Wind energy is infact a disadvantage over the abundance of oil and natural gas. Wind mills are loud and cannot blow 24/7 because of the lack of technology inside. They are an eyesoar for those looking to check out the countryside during vacation and ruin the landscape but cutting down anything in the way of the mills. It is not viable especially for places that do not generate enough wind power so the variations would not be cost effective due to the low amount of energy produced. They must have technications on hands because many birds fly into the turbines because they are following the wind gulf, creating a hazard. Anyone who lives near these giant turbines will complain about the extreme sound of the jet engines as if they live in a city airport. All in all the disadvantages of this outweight the pros.]]>

If all of our engery is coming from the wind and then one day it is not blowing then what do you do? It is relying too heavily on something that is unreliable. Also, it endagers the wildlife. If birds are flying over and they can not see the blades, they will fly into it and probably die. If you set up the wind mills there were animals that used that land before. That may be where they got there food or where they went to sleep. You are taking them out of their area and forcing them to move somewhere else. A lot of peopple move to small farms in order to get away from noise. If you set up these big wind mills that would be disrespecting them and their wishes because they wanted to get away from that.]]>

The truth is that this device does, maybe not while in use but to create it. this windmill need a lot of new technology to create its components and most of these devices that create this device use our natural resources like gasoline, which we know that it can damage our outmosphere.

Just as any other source of energy, wind energy comes with a price to pay. For example, they aren't as transparant as one might have been led to think. They're large structures that require excessive space. Wind power is also unreliable, as the speed and direction the wind blows is unpredictable. These are only two examples and they're just scratching the surface! Windmills used to produce wind energy are poorly engineered and unconventional. Weather-wind especially- is an unpredictable thing. The speed of the wind significantly varies the speed in which the turbine's blades rotate, altering the amount of energy able to be produced. Even more problematic is the case of no wind at all-no power! Sometimes, during heavy storms, a turbine may be struck by lightening, cause damage to the machine. Wind turbines need to be erected in large grids to produce a profitable amount of energy, meaning they consume quite a bit of land. Windmills require land without any obstructions(often natural, preserved land) to achieve maximum exposure to wind. Ironically, the large, unsightly turbines become an obstruction themselves. They taint rural landscapes with their industrial and out-of-place structures.Wind power also isn't as innocent as it's often portrayed. Surprisingly, it does produce pollution-noise pollution, that is. A grid of turbines may generate an equivalent amount of noise as a small jet engine. The destruction of wind energy doesn't stop their either. Tall, closely aranged windmills present a tremendous hazard to any creatures in the sky, particularly migratory birds.]]>

The fact that these turbines require wind to blow through the them is an unconsistent thing to rely on as climate change and other factors can cause wind to not blow sufficiently. Another factor is that wind turbines require flat open spaces with little or no obstructions around them, there are very few advantageous sites where this is possible because the turbines still need to be close to the places they're powering. People are also unwilling to use them not because they don't work, but because they're noisy as well as ugly to most people.

In paragraph three the student says that in 2012 wind turbines in the United States generated about 3% of total U.S. electricity or the equivalent of about 12 million househoulds. That can be seen as a positive, but what about the other 97% of the world that is still living of non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels. If we are going to use a source of energy it should be abundant enough to support the whole counrty not just 3% of it. Another drawback would be wind not being forceful enough to turn the windmill's blades all the time, not giving sufficient energy. This is a drawback because, it is not supplying a countinous source of energy to the place its trying to power. Windmill energy is a nice source for a backup energy source, but it can not be relied on to support a country.]]>

The outcome of expanding wind energy is that it will only deal damage to the country. The most promising disadvantage of expanding wind energy is that it works well if the turbine is free of obstructions. By now the wind turbines have already took up a good precentage of the free wide open areas. With no more areas, the government will need to get rid of space, so that would mean that they would need to buy people out of their homes. But who would want to leave their homes.

For example, an issue arises how wind mills are soley dependent on wind. Wind is a natural process, and therefore is not consistent. Wind mills would would not be pragmatic in areas where the climate does not consist of much wind. In addition, wind mills would also not be as effective in areas with low wind speeds. Even if there are good wind speeds, the consistency of the winds plays a role too. This goes to say that wind mills are not reliable to an extent that it could be used by the whole nation. Another issue is that the wind mills are noisy and obstructive. This would pose a threat to the posperity of an area because people in general will not like to live where they can hear the constant mechanical hum of the wind mill. Wind fasrms are supposed to sound like a small jet engine. People in general do not want to be disturbed in that way.]]>

When the wind blows you dont always know how strong it will be. If the wind blows strong enough it tends to drag things with it. For example, lets say that today it is very windy outside and the wind ends up knocking over your trash can. Since the winds are strong it drags the trashcan and by accident it ends up on the road and the car who is coming ends up having a car accident. Winds don't only cause endangerment to wildlife creatures or to just our rural landscapes but it endangers our life. Winds can cause damage to migrating birds. It can cause them from staying stable in the air as they fly from one place to another. Winds may not blow 24/7 but when they do they cause damages and risk the lifes of animals and people. Winds cause too big turbines which can lead rural landscape to distruction. Houses can get dirty with the the things the wind picks up as it blowing and leave us with pollution. Sometimes the wind can be so strong that it could break our screen door. Move our patio tables and chairs from one side of the porch to another or even right off to the ground. Turbine power varies more than the wind speed does. Trubines varies by 25% and winds speed varies by 10%.The power of the turbines can damage the wires to our lighting. When winds are strong it damages our wires and our light goes out. Light is needed in our houses to be able to do the things we need to get done around the house. Because of winds buildings and forests are often left with obstructions.]]>

Wind power is free and in abundance in certain areas especially where wind speeds are always higher like on a shoreline, at the top of a hill, and in places free of obstructions. So if you live in any of these areas your windmill will not stop blowing it will go all day 24/7. Also windmils may be a little noisy but you wouldnt be able to hear it beause of the energy its bringing to your home, your home will always have electricity and power. Wind power does not generate pollution or radioactive waste so the energy your reciving is good for the earth we are helping the earth by using windmills.]]>

A common complaint is that it would be to noisy to be placed but in actuality it is the pefect thing and can be placed at such a distance that the noise wouldn't effect people's daily lifestyle so often. It may also be a very huge machine but, if well constructed and built it wouldn't be a burden on rual property.

Sure it is more economically friendly than using oil or coal, but it still harms the environment and I don't think that energy is worth using if it is still going to affect the economy in a negative way. For one thing, it endangers wildlife and migrating birds. It negativly affects wildlife because the animals may be curious about the windmill and approach it and they may get harmed by the blades.]]>

By haveing more windmils we can have more natural energy helping us get electricty for our houses and other things we maybe need. All thought they wouldnt be blowing 24/7 they would still making engery for us to use. The downside to the windmil is that it has noisy blade but, you can only hear them if your within a certain distance of them. It doesnt matter if they are really large and have an ugly set up, they help us in the long run. The large windmils have a attraction to lightneing with is a downfall but overall i think windmils should be a part of our world.]]>

Even though wind power does not generate pollution or radioactive waste, it does destroy our forests, mountains and overall our environment. The residential wind power cost has decreased but what if we need to pay more if something happens to these windmills due to lightning and other weather hazards? We'd have no other choice but to raise taxes just to get them back up and running again. Effective they may be for a certain period of time, but are they blowing 24/7? These windmills depend too much on our environment and the wind speed varies by 10% when turbines need 25% to run. We also need to consider how this affects not only us, but the wildlife.

Then that means lots of people would be out of power. When people don't have power they are not very happy about it. What about when there is wind outside but not enough to power the windmill for energy. What will the governmenment tell the people? Lets consider the fact that most people just dont want them there. Some feel like it is not a pretty site to look at. Who would want these big and ugly turbines messing up the landscape. People live in beautiful places why should that be ruined because of these big turbines. Then the fact that these blades could hurt animanls also. Traveling birds could get hurt by the blades and animals that live in the area where the turbines would be put would be out of a home. There are a lot of thing to consider with these.

However, many people do not know the harmful, even life altering affects of wind farms and single turbines. These turbines cause things such as the death of thousands of birds each year and also noise pollution from the wind farms. Wind turbines can be put into large groups called farms and they have a more detrimental effect in those areas. First off, wind energy poses a great threat to many bird populations and even some endangered species in those areas. The farms take up a lot of space and in some cases even destroy natural habitats for these animals. Just like hydroelectric power it is killing thousands of species in order to get electricity. Lastly, the wind turbines are extremely loud and cause a lot of noise pollution which also causes animals to leave the area. The constant droning noise that disturbs the sleeping patterns and circadian rhythm of animals. These disturbances can cause delayed birth, unusual behaviors, and even different eating habits. Noise pollution causes the same things that light pollution causes.]]>

As early as the 1920s we can see that Americans used small windmills to generate electricity in rural areas that lacked such electrical power. Despite this, there are many disadvantages that come with the use of wind energy, especially if it is used as the main source. Unfortunately, this innovative energy source is entirely reliant on the weather. One can see clearly that wind does not blow 100% of the time unlike other sources such as running water. Studies have shown that wind speed will vary greatly even in proven windy areas. Thus, wind energy is not dependable and almost luck based. Even the transfer energy varies in the wind turbine itself and causes inconsistencies. Finally, it is etremely apparent how noisy the win turbines are. The moving blades and transfer of energy causes noise pollution. It ruins the rural landscape and is an annoyance.]]>

Does it really stand as a beneficial source, or just a way for people to spend more money? No doubt, energy soucre does no good for the people. It has noisy blades, it effects the endangered wildlife,and can cause turbine lightning damage. First, wind energy has noisy blades. It has big blades on it and they move in a circualr motion, which causes noises, and those noises can be irritating. Especially if you live in a close vecinity of one, itll bother you when your trying to sleep, or even when your just having quiet time. Who wants somethig like that near them? Second, the wind energy effects the endangered wildlife. Those endangered species are already dying off so why would you create an obstruction near them that could affect their population even more? The wind enegry especailly affects the migrating birds, since the blade are high up in the sky, sometimes the birds could fly into one of them and die. Which also will decrease the bird popualtion in that area. The existence of those endagered species is more important than creating more energy from wind mills, when there are many other ways energy could be created. Lastly,the wind energy can cause turbine lightining damage. Since the wind mills are so high up in the sky, when lightining occurs those would most likely be the first targets to be hit. This will cause damage to not only the wind mill, but to any thing or person near it. Unfortunately, also causing the town further money to be paid. This isn't good because if it was a small town who invested in this wind mill, half their money was spent towards that. So what happens to the expenses of the damgae done. In conclusion, all these factors point to valid reasons why wind mills shouldnt be invested in. They have noisy blades, it affects the endangered wildlife,and can cause turbine lightining damage. Energy can be created in many other safer ways, and wind mills aren't one of them.]]>

Wind, while renewable, is not reliable. Wind does not blow every hour of everyday as coal burns. This could create droughts of electricity when there is no wind. Looking further into wind fluctuations, the gearing inside the windmill creates an effect which multiplies any drop in wind speed. For example, if the wind speed drops by 10% there will be a 25% drop in electrical output. This further eccentuates the problems with an inconsistent breeze. Many green energy advocates say that these windmills will help the environment, however, the mills are actually a nuscience. The wind turbines are big ugly masses that asthetically pollute the rural landscape. They cannot be built anywhere near any buildings, mountains, etc. Another consideration is the offensive noise of the monstrosities. They create a noise akin to that of a small jet engine which takes away the tranquility of rural landscape. These mills are not even designed to withstand lightening which is very common in most windy areas. While considered a practical, green solution to the energy crisis, windmills actually are an impractical stain on rural beauty. The mills even kill migrating birds, how is that an environmentally friendly solution?]]>

One reason is that they're so ugly that they couldn't even stand looking at themselves in the mirror if they could. They have awful design and they are way too big. Also, the turbines don't function all day. Unlike the McDonald's Drive Thru, the turbines aren't open 24/7 and eventually stop blowing. Finally, they destroy wildlife. If one wants to build a wind turbine, they would have to cut down trees and they would affect the flying patterns of birds, endangering them. That is why wind turbines aren't good for using power.]]>

The blades of a windmill can become quite loud, but it isn't always in areas where many people are at where the wind speeds are higher such as the shorelines, at the top of a hill and in places free of obstructions. In the areas that windmills are placed, there aren't many people around to hear the loud noises that they produce. They are placed in the obstructions, swuch as forests, mountians and buildings, but no one is usually around there and that way they can produce more energy without the blockades. Even though wind speed is lower than turbine power by about 15%. wind speed provides safe and non polutting way of producing energy. Many wildlife that fly are seen as being able to be seriously hurt by the windmills, but the windmills will be lower than most birds line of flight and many birds have eye sight that allows them to see far enough into the distance and be able to avoid the windmills ahead. Noise pollution will not really be heard because of the places that the windmills will end up being placed.]]>

This includes the effect on the environment and the unreliability of this source of power. Wind power uses giant turbines in order to generate enough electricity to power several homes. These turbines are noisy, contributing to sound pollution to the point of being comparable to a small jet engine running constantly. It also obstructs the view as well as the potential flight patterns of migrating birds. This can cause the deaths of many birds, which in turn could contribute to an imbalance in the ecosystem. Not only is this source of power disruptive to the lives of people and animals, but it is also an unreliable source of power. Unlike renewable power sources such as geothermal heating, wind power is extremely unreliable. Depending on the weather, these turbines could get no wind for several days on end. If we switched to just wind power, many homes could be without power for a long time. The turbines also have the large potential of conducting electricity, specifically lightning strikes. This would cause damage to the turbines, making them unsafe to work on or be around.]]>

Wind Power, a recent advancement in the energy generating technology, is generated mainly by a completely natural resouce that creates a clean source of energy. Wind Power has fewer environmental impacts than other sources of energy, and it can operate while power grids are down to supply energy to areas that are experiencing a shortage. There are some other renewable energy resources, such as solar and hydroelectric power, and like these forms of natural energy generation, wind power has increased efficiency, but also decreased residential wind power turbine costs. You can now have opportunities where you can choose to use green energy from renewable sources, or pay for electricity that is depleting the world's supply of non-renewable resources such as coal, oil, or natural gas.]]>

Although there are constantly moving air surrents around the planet, ther wind in a certain area does not stay the same. wind does not blow in one area for 24 hours every day. there are constant changes in direction and air speed that could interfere with the power making process. in areas that are completely reliant on wind power, this would prove to be a major flaw. areas could go without power for hours or days at a time when the winds are not blowing hard enough. a town relying entirely on wind is an illogical idea. there needs to be a more reliable, and more predictable source of continuous power for an area. As the editorial stated, wind power is most abundent in areas where wind speed is always higher such as a shoreline or on top of a hill, even in flat areas of land like fields. It's common knowlege that lightning will always find the fasted rout to the ground. placing windmills in flat areas is a bad investment, because they would frequently get struck by lightning. this would not only be a waste of money, but could cause problems for wildlife and the environment.]]>

Although, since it's never windy 24/7 we cannot become, dependant on Wind Power and start to build Wind Farms. Many things can disrupt the actual flow of of the windmill, such as a sudden stop in wind, or birds flying through and getting caught in the turbine. Also, you would have to find a big open field without any buildings, or trees around it to block the wind from getting to the mills.]]>

Wind could be a cleaner source of energy but at the same time it is not reliable. Wind would not be blowing constantly to generate and move the windmills to conduct energy. The wind speeds also vary by 10% when they do occur. The windmills that are built and constructed to generate wind energy are expensive and cause many problems as well. They make a lot of noise along with the turbines that go along with them, they ruin the landscape, obstruct the environment, and can harm or danger birds or other wildlife. The windmills would cause an ugly design and a distraction to the neighborhood they are built in. The height of the windmills could obstruct migrating birds and any other flying animals that could be harmed by the sharp blades of the windmills. Wind energy could be a good, new source of energy but there are still a lot of disadvantages too it that could be dangerous, harmful or distracting.]]>

The wind turbines also have alot of noise and cause noise pollution because of their small jet engine it uses to help turn the heavy blades and produce electricity. With as many as there are in a field, it can cause alot of unwanted and disturbing noise. The turbines also ruin the landscape because people either destroy the landscape to make room, or they put them in an open landscape and plague it's look with modern day technologies. They can also be danger to the environment around them because of their huge blades. If put near a tree, mountain, or building the blade can hit the top of the tree, side of the mountain, or the top of the building and destroy the turbine, the object it came in contact with, or both. The wind speed varies by 10% while the turbine power varies by 25%. This means that it takes more electricity to run than it does the generate which is not effcient at all. Since the turbines are so big, they can also endanger wildlife as well, especially birds. As the birds are flying they can come in contact with the blades and fall to the ground, killing them when they land, if not when they hit the blade. the blades may not move very fast but if something hits the blade or the trunk, the turbine is probably not going to budge or be damaged. Lightning can also strike the turbine and cause some serious damage to the turbine and even the environment around it. Because the turbine is all metal, when lightning strikes it, the lightning will travel through the turbine and in the ground and probably shortciurcut or blow up the whole structure.]]>

As the length of the wire increases, the voltage decreases, which means it is neccasary for the power source to be close to the feeding station. People don't care where their energy comes from. Where the energy was generated by the use of a flammable substance of wind all they care about is if they have it. People aren't going to want to live next to these big ugly windmills.

Because of the fact that it is not always windy could be very detrimental to the amount of energy created and stored. Not to mention the horrible visual the wind turbines have, the large and ugly design which ultimately ruins the rural landscape. The turbines being so large makes them required to be put in a more rural area with nothing close by, however by putting in these large structures puts the animals and wildlife in danger. The amount of noise these make contributes largley to the amount of noise pollution in the area, as well as during stroms the damage pertained because of lightning and other natural occurances makes them not very effective, or worth all of the downfalls.]]>

We are left to believe that wind power will allow the towns to use it all the time, but we are sadly mistaken. The turbines for these more &quot;useful&quot; ways to live are destructive to the environment. Once you look at the facts, the wind power idea does more harm than help and we don't need to struggle more. The wind power don't blowing all the time?! People, communities, cities, and states need power all the time. If you are enabling us from using it when neccessary, then how are we suppose to live without power? Exactly, we can't. There are different time zones for places, so some places get the power, others do not. Understanding that, &quot;wind is a clean source of energy&quot; but if we lack wind sometimes, then people cannot get through their regular day. The turbines just for wind power dismangle the people forests, mountains, and put animal life in danger. In the article it states, &quot;the use of wind for energy has fewer environmental impacts tha usig any other energy sources.&quot; In reality, they are knocking down trees, mountains for the the turbines and that has no environmental impact? Animals homes are being destroyed and animals are forced to relocate to survive. What is the wind power really doing for us? It's not doing any good, we should come up with a better way to save the town!]]>

While is is true that wind turbines may disturb a rural landscape in terms of beauty, that same setting wouldnt be pretty if everything was dead because of the damage fossile fuels do to the environment. Yes, beauty is a factor, but it isnt a decorating contest, its a cleaner way to preduce energy and help the environment that is already being destroyed. Birds may be harmed by wind turbines, however they are also harmed by airplanes and various othr man made objects.

Supporters of windmills try to make Wind Power sound flawless, when in reality there are many negative aspects being left out. Not only are windmills noisy, turbines too big and of ugly design, but they also ruin the landscape. With this comes obstructions to the beautiful scenery, but more importantly the windmills endanger wildlife through habitat destruction. The noise pollution and noisy blades send the natural animal inhabitants running in the opposite direction, that is, if they are so lucky. It is often the case that many migrating birds fly into the blades and die.]]>

One wind turbine that is going really fast is really loud and sounds like a helicopter, but more than one would create noise pollution that would both effect humans and animals. Why would you need more than one? Compared to other sources of energy creation wind trubines produce a very small amount of energy. Also if not placed in the correct location they may not even blow all the time. The biggest problem with this type of energy is that we cannot control how much of it is produced only the wind can do that.]]>

That's most likely why windmills are illustrated as perfect environment-saving machines that are to good to be true. Well they are. These turbines are not consistent and if there is no wind, whole communities will be without power. They also ruin the landscape of natural and man made terrains such as forests, mountains, buildings, and other structures of which some citizens enjoy. Wind farms also produce large amounts of noise and sound equivalent to a jet engine. As if to make it worse, these winmills are prone to lightning strikes which could cause hundreds of thousands of dollars in replacements or repairs for damages.]]>

First of all, wind energy could never be relied on as a priamry energy source because wind does not blow 24/7. whats gonna happen when th ewind just stops for a period of time? Are we just going to not have electricity? That's just not realistic. Also, lets not forget the damage that this source of energy does to rural life. The noisy blades, sounding like a jet engine, are hard to deal with, and they can ruin the beauty of the landscape that they occupy.

Our glorious leader Al Gore would always want the other viewpoint to be known, and as such I will present this viewpoint. Supporters of wind power are evil, they do not care about the environment, and they especially do not care about birds. Birds could fly into the turbines of the windmill and be killed. Birds chopped up into little pieces, smashed into a pulp, destroyed by the monstrous turbines use to generate wind power. Whole populations could suffer from a loss of genetic diversity resulting from large numbers of birds dying before they can make it to the breeding grounds and get some sweet, sweet bird lovin'. Our lord Al Gore would also want the detrimental effects of wind power on the general areas resale value. These hulking behemoths of steel, spinning away whenever they can, stark white against the pristine landscape, destroy land values. People don't want to buy land near these hideos manmade monstrosities, so the value goes down, and the area is flooded with gypsies and poor people, further lowering the land value. Al Gore wants all people to be able to sell their land at a high price, so we must not accept wind power because of the threats it poses to area value.]]>

Firstly the wind is not contantly blowing, there would be times were the turbines are producing no electricity. Wind speed also varies by 10 percent and the power of the tubine varies by 25 percent so there would times when the wind farms are not producing enough energy. Also wind turbines are at risk from lightning, due to the laws of physics tall objects made from metal are likely to be stuck by lightning and wind turbines are tall metal objects making them the frequently damaged by lightning strikes. While Wind turbines are more ecologicaly sound than other forms of energy they still have some negitive impact on the enviroment. First wind turbines are noisey and produce noise polution, the amount of noise a wind farm produces is simlar to the amount of nosie produced by a small jet engine. Also wind turbines are large and obstruct the land scape of rural areas. Wind turbines also pose a danger to wild life, migrating birds can fly into the turbines and be killed creating a problem for the populations of endangered birds.]]>

The electricity that Wind power turbines generate come from the amount of wind produced. Wind is not blowing 24/7, which means that on those days what ever is being powered through the wind turbines, will not be available for use, or wont work as effectively. This will cause problems, because if something that is necessary to use everyday, and then one day it is not working, what can you do? Not only will they not be able to power things everyday, but turbines arent the most pleasent things to look at. &quot;...wind speeds are always higher such as on the shoreline, at the top of a hill, and in places free of obstructions.&quot; One of the best ways to get a good amount of wind speed is if you place a wind turbine on a shoreline, now the shore is something beautiful, a place where people go to have fun, relax, and bound, that'll all be ruined by a big, ugly designed wind turbined. Lastly they may help our environment with one thing, but they'll endanger wildlife, and migrating birds. Picture this sceneario, a 100 foot tall wind power turbine, spinning rapidly with its 3 60 foot long blades, and a flock of birds flying, migrating to the south or the north, towards the blades... not a pretty outcome. This will cause more birds to die, and perhaps in time become instinct. Wind power turbines have a number of good qualities, but they also have a variety of bad ones, one in which is harming our environment. They should be more carefully evaluated, and fix the negative outcomes that will be present if they are placed around the world.]]>

And they are like snails that that turn in the wind and generate energy. Almost like the effect of wind on airplane wings, and it flows over the blades creating lift causing them to rotate. Wind is a clean source of energy, and overall, the use of wind for energy has fewer environmental impacts than using many other energy sources.]]>

When trying to create renewable engery with wind, we have to keep in mind that wind is not constant, meaning it would cause a lot of set backs on creating more engery since we have no wind to create it. Also, placing wind turbines can cause many obstuctions to a number of man-made structures such as forests, mountains, and buildings. We have caused enough damage in our environment, we dont need to add on. Last, but certainly not least, these wind turbines can endanger many wild life for example migrating birds.

It relys on the weather of that day. If there is no wind then it is in possible for there to be wind energy because there would be nothing for the turbines to wind. Another disadvantage is that the blades are very noisy, it is great to have wind energy but to hear the blades most of the time have to suck. The turbines super big and not very well design so i woudn't want that in my yard. the advantages of this is that you are saving a lot of money and energy.]]>

In contrast, wind power is not a great way to produce energy. I strongly say this because it causes many obstructions, there is no sustainability for the amount of wind that will generate these windmills, and dangerous during thunderstorms. Windmills cause many obstructions because these mills are being man made to try and make our energy from renewable rescoures, however, by making man made windmills; we would be impeaving with nature. Nature is very crucial in our world becasue it is the organic and healthy way of recieving our energy everyday. If one where to believe that by making these windmills on natures property, that we will improving ther words renewable resources, I will strongly have to oppose. It is contridicting the thinking of clean energy. In addition, I believe that wind power is by all means not necessary to produce electricity is because there is no sustainability as to how much wind there will be in order to allow these wings of the windmill to move therefore producing electricity. We cannot estimate the amount of wind that will blow from any certain direction in order to be one hundred percent sure that these windmills will be effective. Research shows that a wind speed maries by 10%, and a turbine power varies 25%. Where will the 15% come from inorder to generate this mill? Furthermore, another reason why Wind power is a incredulous way to produce energy is because it is extremely dangerous when there are thunderstorms. You may think, well its not always going to rain so why would this be so dangerous? In complience I do agree to a certain degree. However, think of the time that it does rain and a severe thunderstorm comes about, what then? Lighting itself is already a hazard to tall trees and telephone poles and even bodies of water, as these are conductords of electricity. So iiif there fires in forest and metropolitian areas already, why build tons of windmills in a vast rural area to produce electricity when chances are you will be building a chain reaction of destruction. In conclusion, this is why I strongly believe wind energy windmills are not only simply noisy and ruin rural landscapes, but also that they cause many obstructions, there is no sustainability to the wind speed that will generate this windmills, and lastly that they are incredibly dangerous during thunderstorms.]]>

What the readers is trying to say is that windmills arent used as much as they used to anymore but they are an amazing thing to have in case of an emergency. although,there are some dissadvantages of windmills such as noisy blades, turbines too big,ugly and ruin the rural landscape,noise pollution and they endager wildlife and cause birds to migrate.

There a re many reasons for why the world hasent gone with this type of energy and that is because the wind dosent always blow 24/7, the wind speed varies by 10% and the turbines are powered by 25%, and many other reasons. So it may seem like a very good alternative but in the long run it just isint the new face for America. The wind is not the only factor that we have to worry about the designing is a big factor because people see these wind mills as distracting and ugly so they dont want them near there house. Also they ruin landscapes because they have to be built so big they cause us to tear down forrst and other ecosystems cause more pollution than they will probably get rid of. The wildlife that lives in those areas has to move out and leave which could cause a major blow to a city or town that might rely on them for food, protection, or even money. So these wind mills have to go. Lastly the wind mills make very loud noises and can aggravate people and even cost them money for something they didnt want because of the breakdowns and being destroyed by passing storms. So wind mills are not they way to go because of the various problems they create not only for people but also for the animals.]]>

The noise emmited by the spinning blades leades to noise polution. this noise polution is disruptive to residents livind near the turbine. Each turbine, when in motion produces tha same amount of noise as a small jet engine. Wind farms are anything but quite. If a wind turbine was to be place in a area where people reside the noise given off would desturbe there daily life. A noise comparaible to a small jet engine is not easly tuned out, even if the person is exposed to it for awhile. Not to mention the possibilty of hearing loss. Wind turbines are too loude to be placed with in close proxmity to a residental area. There is also the facto of in consisrant wind. Wind is a renewable power sorce but there is no garonte that the wind will blow with a consistent enough wind speed to keep the turbine spinning. There are many obstructions that could slow or even block the wind. things such as trees and moutains. One could always try to remove theses blocks but that would cause more damage to the envorment then the wind turbine would help. in some cases it would not be pra ctel to plase turbines.]]>

Many people see wind energy as the perfect source because it is clean, completely renewable, and always available. However, this is not true. The wind is not blowing at all hours of every day. There are some days when the wind doesnt blow at all. Also, many people are bothered by the noise that the blades and machines make, so they would have to be put in a secluded place, which are not very abundant. They can also be harmful to animals. There are endagered wildlife and migrating birds that can be harmed and killed by these structures. There is too much pollution from these structures and wind energy does not make sense.]]>

They blow 24/7 and has noisy blades.&quot; All this noise from the turbine will interupt the sleep of farm families and animals. The design of the turbines seem to give off an old and dingy look. The blades from the turbines are usually loud and sometimes creeky. Windmills usually give off a rusty scary look. However windmills come in handy of good support for farmers. Farmers use windmills as a relliable source such as &quot; The sole source of power during times when the electrical grid is out, especially when enduring hurricanes, power outages, or brown outs. Wind is an excellent supplement to other renewable resources such as solar and hydroelectric power.&quot; In the 1920's American colonists used turbines to grind wheat and corn, pump water, and to cut wood at sawmills. Tords the late 1920's Americans began to use the windmills as a source for energy on empty areas, with no electricity.]]>

The biger the turbine the more energy the windmills can crerate to hold your household. Also the turbine size depends on size of house. if you have a small house you will have a smaller windmill with a smaller turbine, where as a bigger house needs a bigger windmill and turbine to give the house electricity.

Even in places with wind, the turbine does not produce energy all day. Theres are moments in the day where winds are scarce and the turbine does not create energy. This can be a major issue. In places where energy is needed at all times of the day, wind power would not be an alternative. Windmills would work only if the weather permits. In the modern era, people cannot depend on energy some of the time; it is essential at all times of the day. Not only is there limited power, the machine is unpredictable in its output. The wind that gives it potential energy always varies. The wind speed varies by 10% on a typical day. For buildings that require a specific amount of energy each day, this can be problematic. To add on, the power produced by the turbine varies by 25%. Even with stardard wind speeds, the outut is still unpredictable. This combined with the variations in wind results in a large margin for error. sustainable energy is crucial for homes, offices, and public places. The windmills have too much room for error.]]>

It may be an efficient power source to execute farming, pumping water and work sawmills; and they do work great in rural areas. But even with several green benefits, there are still spots in wind energy that just is not consistent. Windmill blades can create electric energy when in a windy enviornment but this obviously relies on how windy it is. Without wind blowing 24/7, the windmills are virtually useless. Even if there is wind blowing there are still percentage statistics that downgrade wind power efficiency. The average wind speed varies by 10%, so no fault goes to the consistency of wind; most of what you get is constant depending on the area. The efficiency problem lies in the windmill itself. People can not exactly be sure if what they see in efficiency is what they will get. When given wind there will be times when windmills will give you an abundance of energy. But the amount of energy can vary by as much as 25%. In addition to efficiency there is always the concern of safety for the windmill's enviornment. The giant blades can pose as a great danger for ongoing birds. Birds are mainly the animal at risk, as they could very well be injured or killed if flying too close to windmills. And with being at such a high point, the turbines could easily attract lightning during a storm. If lightning strikes there will likely not be many humans directly affected by it. But if the turbines are close to a wooded area or forests, then it can start a forestfire dealing massive damage to the enviornment. When looking at the downsides of wind energy it may be a better idea to look into other renewable energy sources before committing to wind energy.]]>

Windmills placed in the countryside obstruct forests and mountains, as well as migratory birds that can potentially be killed by a windmill. Finally, wind energy is not entirely reliable, as it relies on the wind to produce energy. In fact, the turbine power varies by 25% depending on the wind speed.

You can get free power by having wind mills such as a &quot;wind farm&quot;. thats were you have a massive amount of wind mills in one high location were wind moves freely. Wind can generate enough energy for large numbers of people. In 2012, wind turbines generated about 3% of total U.S. electricity. Thats equivalent to about 12 million households. Wind power is not a good idea. first off the wind is not blowing 100% of the time. So that would be a big problem right there. no wind, no power. Then turbines can be damaged by lightning so we dont want to keep replacing them. they are loud and annoying for the ones living by them and they just take up too much space. They would only benefit few people because some areas are not the right climate and have no moving wind.]]>

Some drawbacks of wind energy are that it is completely useless when the wind is not blowing. Another drawback is that in order to increase the production of wind energy, lots of turbines need to be created which creates lots of noise and an ugly landscape. in order to create more turbines, lots of recources wil need to be used and lots of land needs to be cleared which can harm the ecosystem.]]>

Wind energy comes from windmills, which theoretically can blow 24/7 during &quot;hurricanes, power outages, or brown outs&quot;, but in reality windmills still face weather issues such as turbine lightning damage. Windmills also face obstructions such as forests, mountains, buildings, and other structures, which hinder their sails from turning to create wind energy. Wind energy, produced by windmills and windfarms, is able to harm the environment through noise pollution, and endangering wildlife. In order to create wind energy, windmill blades must cut through the air to turn an electric generator. This motion causes the blades to create noise tantamount to that of a small jet engine. In addition to noise pollution, windmills can endanger natural species, such as birds. Birds may fly near windmills, only to get struck down and injured or worse die. Therefore, although wind energy seems like a perfect green energy source, it has many problems due to external conditions it faces, and the noise pollution and endangerment of wildlife it creates.]]>

Although the benefits of Wind energy are extremely promising, many indivduals fail to realize the disadvantages that come with building wind turbines. By building massive amounts of wind turbines in order to provide electricity, there would be obstructions to nature and wildlife. Furthermore, wind is not an absolute source of energy and can cause noise pollution in the environnment. It is clear that although wind energy does hold potential it still negatively affects nature and animals for the sake for more electricity. Building wind mills is a grueling task and in conclusion it takes up a lot of space. In order to achieve the required amount of electricity to provide for the whole U.S population, a massive amounts of land would have to be sacrificed. In doing so, more harm would be caused to the environnment which is the opposite of what &quot;green energy&quot; is trying to accomplish. Sacrificinng precious land and forests filled with tress and wildlife would be a step backwards in sustaning the ever so fragile enviornment. Furthermore, wind mills would negatively affect many wildlifes such as birds by disrupting the flow of migrating birds. This would lead to a domino effect in which the whole ecosystem may be harmed. The loud noises that are caused due to the windmills would further hinder other wildlife and interupt with the flow of nature. Also, since it causes so much noise, it would not be wise to install windmills in homes as it would disturb other residents. It is clear that, although wind energy is seen as a benefit towards the enviornment, in reality it may do more harm than good. The massive amounts of land and disturbance that it causes simply isn't worth the extra 3% of electricty when it is harming our ecosystem and threatning wildlife.]]>

Americans use electricity every day in order to complete menial tasks such as using light bulbs, washing dishes, and cleaning the house. Such small tasks when added together utilize a large amount of electricity. For such a high usage of electricity, wind farms would need to be running 24 hours a day, seven days a week. However, this is not the case. Rarely are wind turbines running 24 hours a day, mother nature does not run on humans accords. If the wind speed vaires by 10%, then turbine power varies by 25%. Yes wind turbines provide energy, but they are not as efficient non-renewable energy. Wind power is renewable, however wind turbines obstruct the natural environment. The juxtaposition between renewable energy using wind turbines and the obstruction of the natural environment the wind turbines cause is a strange one. Turbines are big, they are ugly, and they ruin the rural landscape. On top of this, the noisy blades account towards the sound of a small jet engine. The placement of wind farms ruin wildlife habitats and migration paterns. Does ruining the land scape and it's inhabitants outweigh the benefits of renewable energy? For sure, wind farms do what non-renewable does, condemn the environment.]]>

Some poeple may say that the disadvantages of wind energy are that the blades of the wind mill are noisy, the turbines are too big, have an ugly design, and they ruin rural landscape. But those things can always be changed. For example the turbines can be made smaller to not look as ugly. Some people may also say that the wind turbines will put birds and other wildlife at danger. A soution to that problem could be to put a natural repelant on the turbines to make sure all wildlife stays away from the turbines.]]>

It is a man made machine that is being generated off of wind which is in the atmosphere naturally. Wind Power can replae the heavy use of electricity and the heavy use of fossil fuels and others resources. By limiting the resources when using wind power, its conserving the sources we have thata re running out. Wind Power shouldn't be used due to the fact that wind does not occur 24 hours of the day for all 365 days in the year. That would mean that people would be powerless when wind is not occuring. Also, thw wind blades may put many wildlife in danger. Wild life is just as essential to the planet Earth as humans. Furthermore, much space would have to be cleared out to support the construction of wind blades. The would lead to much destruction of forrests, mountains,building, and many people homes and/or wildlife homes.]]>

While there is verying wind patterns we know from sceince and weather technology where the wind blows the most.

You have to be kidding me...I am only writing this so it does not look like I am finishing my test too early and not trying. Here is my opposing view because that's what I want to tell you. This test is just a huge waste of time for my class. I know we are just taking it because we are the grade, or class, that is just taking it to see how it goes. So what the hell, I'm just going to tell you what's on my mind. First, just think about this for a second, when you were a kid, what did you dream about doing. What were your aspirations. Just take a minute..... Ok now look at what you are doing, you are grading bullshit essays on a standardized tests. Wow, how many have you read so far..? Seriosly, do not give up on your dreams. Life is too fucking short to be grading essays that high schoolers wrote. The American Dream is bullshit. Go to school, go to college, get a fucking job, mortgage a house that you leave empty going to your job, buy a car that you really only use to get to work....that does NOT seem right. Fuck it, quit your job, go whereever you want. Get the job that you dreamed of as a kid. Do not ever waste your time doing something that you do not want to do. You only go to work to buy nice things, but do they really make you happy...? Go travel, meet new people, experience new things If everyone did what made them happy, instead of worrying about money and getting a fucking career that you daddy and mommy wanted you to do, do what you want, what you think is right, what makes you happy, and most of all what your heart wants.]]>

Why would anyone want to live in an area with a large noisy wind turbine that endangers the migrating birds and wildlife. I could only imagine driving down the road and watching a bird fly right into one of these turbines and splatter before my eyes. Yes the energy is crucial to the continuation of the future generations energy consumption but the disadvantages should be weighed as well.]]>

Wind terbimes can cause wild fires in forests and are harmfull to migrating and other types of birds that might fly in their path.

One of the main reasons why wind energy is not a good this is because of noise pollution, such as wind farms and small jet engines. With this being said if these windmills are super noisy then alot of people will not want to be around that area. Also the blades are noisy, or can be on a windmill. Thats just one of the problems that wind energy can cause. Another problem that can come from wind energy is obstructions. To have turbines you have to have a large area of land, and forests may have to be cut down to place the turbines where the owner wants them. Also some buildings may have to be torn down for the windmills and they could be important places that are being torn down that could have been there for many years. Turbines, and windmilles takes up a large area and seems to be an unnecessary investment when good things can be destroyed in the process. Last but notn least they can cost a fortune to put up. Having turbines or windmilles is not 100% sure that it can or will make you money. With that being said you could have used more money to put the turbines up and in the long run you might not make any profit. So putting up turbines can be a danger to your pocket and time consuming.this is some reasons why turbines and windmills are not such a good thing.]]>

The small jet engine within the wind mill causes the blades to be very noisey , creating noise pollution for the environment. The amount of wind speed produced varies by 10% and tubine power varies by 25%, causing many obstructions to forests , mountains, buildings and other man- made structures as the pressure and force exerted from the wind destroys them.Wind energy has also endangered wildlife and migrating birds because it blows away not only their homes they've built but possibly their food. A great amount of rural landscape has been ruined becuase the turbines are too big and have an ugly design. Although wind energy is seen as a useful source to the environment , it can also be a destructing force as well.]]>

Wind turbines should not be used as a source of power because they destroy wildlife habitats and are very noisy. The wind turbines are very large structures that take up a lot of space. They drive the neighboring homes property value down drastically because of the noise and the ugly design. Also, the wind does not always blow so the turbine is not always making electricity. Sometimes it might just be sitting there all day doing absolutley nothing. The wind speeds vary by 10% and the turbine power varies from 25%. In reality, the wind turbines dont really produce that much power. With a large object in the air like the wind turbine, it is a danger to wildlife. The many birds that migrate might fly into the turbine. When building the turbines, many times trees and wooded areas need to be cut down to make room for the massive structures. This destroys the habitate of many wid animals. Also, the noise from the turbines is very loud. It disturbs the animals natural habitate along with any human living near by. The wind turbines need to be stopped from being put up everywhere. They diminish property value and destroy animal's natural habitat. The popularity of wind turbines might be going up but the damaging effects of these massive structures is rising too.]]>

For instance if the wind isnt blowing whats the use of windpower, where would those people get the energy needed for power. The huge noisy blades ruin rural landscape by ruining forests, buildings, or other man made structures around the area. Wind isnt always there so the turbine power would take up most to the power being gained. WindPower should not be an option for the turbines endanger wildlife and migrating birds that may be around the area, getting sucked into the huge blades to their death. The huge turbines can get lightening damage which would cost more to fix and repair then what the turbine would actually be saving us. The engine would make noise pollutioon creating an environment no one wants to be in. WindPower is a huge disadvantage, they pollute our environment, endanger our animals, and cost more then they save us.THe turbines only generated about 3% of the total U.S electricity therefor not doing much good in saving electric energy. We should stick to other resources and not waste our time, money and effort by using windpower.]]>

Windmills are most likely to also be surrounded by more than one windmill, called wind farms, which can create a lot of noise. Wind farms can also take away from the beauty of the area should they be placed in rural landscape because of their big, ugly design. They can obstruct things such as forests, mountains, buildings, and other mad-made objects. The rate at which windmills can produce energy are also highly reliant on how the wind is blowing, which does not blow 24/7. Lastly, windmills can be dangerous to both humans and wildlife as they can endanger wild birds or cause turbine lightning damage.]]>

The different types of disadvantages with wind energy is that the windmills can be noisy, they depend on the weather, and the turbines can't be placed anywhere. These disadvantages are reasons why we shouldn't use wind energy. When the windmills are turning from the wind it can be noisy and disturb others around it. By doing this it would have to be placed ontop a high hill where the turbines can't disturb others. This makes producing wind energy difficult because not all areas can support a windmill. The issue of the windmill depending on the weather is a big deal. If the weather one day is sunny and dry with no winds then wind energy won't be produced. If it's raining non stop then that weather can cause the turbines to rust. The rust would make it even harder for wind energy to be produced.]]>

You're only up half the day and you won't really need it while you are asleep. They also say that They have noise blades but its something worth the noise because without the windmill what would help create the energy back in the 1920s? The people in the 1920s used it for many things, like electricity, grinding wheat, pumping water or to cut wood. They also say that they have and ugly design and ruin the landscape, but why does have to have a pretty design to help us in life? I mean if it helps us then we will use it because we didn't have much back in the 1920s. And they don't ruin landscape they were put there because that is a location that had a lot of wind energy.]]>

For every 10% change in speed there's a 25% change in power. With that we don't have wind all the time . It doesn't keep blowing 24/7. Not only does it keep changing at variable speeds, it's also ruining our landscapes. The turbines we use are big, ugly designs that take away from rural landscapes. It also obstructs forests, mountains, buildings, and other man made structures. It even endangers wildlife, such as migrating birds. With these in the way the propelers on them could hit a flock and kill them. If that wasn't bad enough they cause noise pollution. Each turbine is very noisy and have the equivalence of a small jet enging. Imagine all of that in a wind farm, that's going to be very noisy and you'll hear that every day. There's also the concern of lightning damage. If one of the turbines gets hit, who's going to pay for it? I'm pretty sure that it's going to cost a lot of money to repair those damages.]]>

They produce a lot of noise pollution, clutter landscapes, don't always create energy, and do not appeal to the eye.The blades are noisy and wind farms create sounds such as a small jet engine would. The turbine is too large and the design is not asthetically pleasing to the eye when placed in the middle of a landscape, and it requires the obstruction of forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. The blades also potentially pose a threat to endangered wildlife and migrating birds. The wind farms also face potential damage from lightning creating a potential need to constantly replace or repair the wind turbines. Another downside is the issue of the wind not constantly blowing. The turbine power varies by 25% and wind speed varies by 10% making the energy level unpredictable and proving the turbines not to be a steady source of energy.]]>

Plus there aren't a lot of manufacturing places which then means the parts must be moved thousands of miles by uneffiecient semi trucks which get 4 miles to the gallon. In rural Central Washington state where there is enough to justify the cost of building them. They ruin the landscape, plus oftentimes wire must be run hundreds of miles to the nearest metropolian area, still using a lot of metal, mainly aluminum which is quite expensive, nonrenewable and takes a lot of energy to process from ore. There are obstructions to wildlife, the windmills can hit birds and kill them. The turbines, wind mill towers and blades must be extremely tall, many windmills are over 250 ft tall, still another expense in materials and transportation that requires a significant amount of energy even before the windmill starts producing energy. Windmills also are very dependent on the wind, if it is a windy day, then there is less energy to be gathered, which then means going back to nonrenewable sources such as coal and natural gas, all in all, this makes it far too expensive to be practical on a large scale, hydroelectric is a much better solution, energy can be stored and released as needed, plus the dams provide flood control, and also provide drinking water and recreation in the summer in the forms of the lakes they create.]]>

The only problem with this article is that it only told you the good parts of it. There are probably thousands upon thousands of different reasons why the windmills are bad. I think that one of the bad points would be how much space the windmills take up. The windmills are huge and completely taking up more room on farmers land. The windmills are just going to keep coming and there are going to be more and more of them. The only problem is if they take up so much space where are we going to star putting them? Are we going to put them in fields? Mountains? If we keep bringing more and more windmills into our lives maybe the less space we have for ourselves. In conclusion I think that the windmills are a bad idea. I bet in the near future if the world keeps bringing the windmills up that they will just be everywhere. No one wants to go outside and see a huge piece of mechanical junk in there front lawn. All we need to do is protest and try our hardest to keep the windmills out of our lives.]]>

This is a disadvantage because wind can give us energy and it saves us money, but if there isn't any wind then we can use it for energy. As a result of the windmill blades being so large, it may cause the blades to be noisy. In order for thw ind to actually give us energy the windmills have to be large and big enough to produce energy. The design of the windmills might not be the best to look at, and they also might not be the most fun thing to look at but i think that if they are in an open land and they somewhat match the surroundings then they would be fine. There are some obstuctions however with these large conductors of energy, for example forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures, and these generators of energy require a lot of space because they are so large.]]>

For example, Wind Power can be very difficult to adequately harvest. There are very few places that always have enough wind to power a turbine that are also free of obstructions such as forests, mountains, and large buildings, and a wind speed variation of as little as 10% can raise or lower the power output of a turbine by as much as 25%. Additionally, wind turbines can have a decidedly negative effect on the surrounding environment and landscape. Wind turbines have often been complained about as having ruined the rural landcape, due to the unnatural nature of the giant pillars topped with spinning blades. The blades and turbines also cause a significant amount of noise, and a wind farm can cause as much noise as a small jet engine.]]>

The wind might blow in certain places but not everywhere, and wind is definatly not blowing 24/7. These giant structures arent the quietest things youll ever hear. The blades on the fans can be very noisy at times and disturb peace of nearby citizens. Since these structures are so tale there is an increased chance of lightning striking it and damaging it or maybe other people around it. They are just too big, there design is ugly, they ruin rural landscape, i mean who wants to look at a giant fan? These things can also hurt humanity because of bird migration, when bird fly south for the winter wind farms can stop that from happening. Its not like the power coming from these are consistent, the power varies by 25%, that means one day it could produce more power than expected and the other day it could barely emit power. In conclusion these wind farms are not neccessary, they are too big, to noisy, and to harmful to be a primary source of power.]]>

Wind does not blow all the time, causing this to be an unrealiable source of energy. In certain areas, there is less wind than in some other places, causing a different locations to have more wind energy than others. Wind speed is also a factor. When wind speed can only reach up to 10 percent the efficeincy of turbine power would vary to around 25 percent. Noisy blades, are a distubance to certain people who live near, or among the wind farms. The landscape is also to be affected. Wind farms take up a lot of room, meaning that obstuctions in the way will have to be moved. Natural habitats and environments would have to be destroyed to have a source of energy that might not work all the time. There is also the cost of if these windmills breaking down and having to pay for the small jet engine that helps run the windmill. Where will that money come from? Wildlife would take a hard blow from allowing windmills to be put in place. Some species of wildlife could become in danger with being hurt by the windmills and potentially dying because of them. Endangered species could be gone because their habitat is gone and they are getting hurt in the process of migrating. These disadvantages have to be regarded to see the counterclaim against having wind farms and energy.]]>

For example, there is not one single place in the U.S. where wind is constantly blowing. There may be places that have wind nine times out of ten, but the atmosphere always experiences down time. Also, wind farms, which are created when hundreds of wind turbines are placed very close together, are found to be the source of high levels of noise pollution when the farm is actively creating energy. Some view technological feats such as wind farms as a source of man made beauty. However, the turbines that are used are most often white and ugly, which ruins the rural landscape of the country side around cities. Also, those large ugly blades have been proven to endanger migrating birds while also slowing the movement of traffic during transport.]]>

To have a wind trubine, it must be placed in an area that is usually windy, else it's compleatly useless. Also they depend on how hard the wind is blowing and when. The average wind speed varies by 10%, while the turbine power made from it varies by 25%. Plus to get them high enough, you'd have to avoid most obstructions like forest, mountain terrain, buildings and wildlife. Most birds would be flying around the hight that the turbines are placed, and they could get hit or even killed. Not to mention the weather. They could get struck by lightning at any time or mabe even blown to pieces in a strong storm or hurricane. Then they would truly be useless. After words you have the cost to worry about. How much does it cost to make just one of these wind turbines? How much would it then cost to pay for your electricity to be run by them? And there's the fact that not everyone can run their electricity off of them. Even with a wind farm, how far could that power go? Then your back to the problem of where to put them because they can't just be placed around randomly; you wouldn't get much power out of it. Not to mention that their very noisy and ruin rural landscapes. They can be somewhat helpful, but they just aren't as helpful as people may think.]]>

Wind is never blowing all the time, even in the most windy areas,as well as wind does not blow at the same speed, so the amount of power generated is never the same or predictable. Wind mills are huge, streaching hundereds of feet into the sky. This makes it so that wind mills can block views of people trying to get pictures or just enjoying the senery. Wind mills are also very vunerable to lighting, as they usually are the tallest thing around. Finally, Wind mills can disrupt wildlife in the area.]]>

If the world were to run on wind power we wouldn't need to have it running twenty four hours a day seven days a week. Also, the world isn't completely run on wind power. I like to think of it more like a back up plan. The blades might be noisy, however they are usually in remote locations, not in your backyard. Also, I think the sound of them is quite relaxing and the wind usually blocks out most of the sound anyways. His third point is really just a matter of opinion. I think they are actually quite pretty. And I would like to ask him how he'd feel if a wind turbine called him ugly. Get bent student. Obviously it's going to require land, but all great things do. Again if the wind isn't blowign at full speed it's not the only thing the world is being powered by. You would think that using other sources of power would endanger wildlife such as coal or if a nuclear power facility blew up. At this point he's just looking for things to complain about! Lightning can damage anything and by the looks of this students notes it probably damaged his brain. Really? Noise pollution? Is this seriously a thing? GET OVER IT!! It's noise. It's not a nuclear bomb is NOISE!! Get super bent.]]>

People will knock down many trees just to put up these wind power generators. Wind powers will turn at a fast speed, and will cause a lot of noise.

When wind mills are in use they are very noisy almost like a jet engine and some say its a sight for sore eyes. it is a humongus fan that ruins the surround land. A few other disadvantages to Wind mills is they harm migrating birds which some are now endangered animals. Also to get enough wind the machine has to be extremely tall and there only so many flat places around here they can not really go on a mountain or in a forest. Then hitching on to the problem it makes them great targets in lighting storms and to that effect it would cost thousands to fix it. Wind mills are a clean way to make engery but it will cost the people some hefty taxes to build.]]>

Plus, the wind speed varies by 10%, and turbine power varies by 25%. Not only do the speeds vary, but it's also a huge thorn to the eye. The turbines are too big, the design is hideous, and it will ruin rural landscape. It is also extremely noisy. Maybe it won't cause land or air pollution, but it certainly does cause noise pollution. The sound of these windmills is equal to that of a small jet engine. All of these which make wind energy a very unreliable and unpleasant source of energy. Not only are windmills unreliable and unpleasant to the eye, but they are also dangerous. Studies show that windmills endanger the life of migrating birds, and other wildlife. It also goes through turbine lightning damage. Not to mention all of the obstructions of windmills: forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. Wind energy is a very bad source of energy, for multiple reasons, but over all, it's unreliable, an eye sore, and dangerous and destructive.]]>

One of the main disadvantages is the way wind farms affect the rural landscape. The turbines are huge and quite ugly; they distract from the natural beauty around them. They are extremely noisy and somtimes sound like a small jet engine. Wind turbines interrupt the tranquil beauty of rural areas. Even at night they are a distraction. Turbines have red warning lights that blink during the night to prevent things like planes from running into them. It is rather frustrating, when looking at the incredible stars in the sky to have red lights blinking in the distance. Also, the productivity of wind turbines is not constant. As wind varies, so does the power of the turbine. Since the wind doesn't blow 24/7, the turbines cannot be generating power constantly. Another disadvantage wind energy has is its affect on the environment and the creatures in nature. Wind turbine provide an obstruction in the paths of migrating birds. Wind energy endangers wildlife. While there may be many good things about wind energy, there are also many bad side effects. All of these points should be considered in the decision of whether or not to use wind energy. It may be decided that wind farms are not the best alternative.]]>

Since a lot of them are being installed among fields that can be used to plant vegetables like potatoes, beans, sugar beets, corn, and other products. Farmers need those products in order to make money and be a more economically good city. Also there are other ways to get energy easily. Another way to get energy is using solar panels. it is effective and it won't break down, There would be no neccesity to fix solar panels. And with wind mills, they can break and one will have to fix them. Also with wind mills it takes a while to install them, because they are big in size and with solar panels it don't take as much time. Solar panels can be used everywhere like in your backpack to charge ones phone or to use a calculator that powers up with light or anywhere and with wind mills they always have to stay in the same spot, one can't take them anywhere.

The major one is that it ruins the rural landscape. Having a giant man made turbine in the open. Not only does it ruin the sight, but it also put animals in the near by area in danger. It is a very big danger to animals such as migrating birds. The other major problem that occurs with these turbines are they are just too loud. They make a noise about the same equvalent to a small jet engine. They also aren't moving 24/7 to create energy. Wind speed varies by 10%- turbine power varies by 255.]]>

For example: While wind energy is a far more efficent form of gathering energy their are just to many complications as to what could happen to these giant wind powered blades. Extensive damage done to one of these machines could cost a fortune to repair or replace. There are also many other promising alternative fuel sources that we can dig into in this modern age.]]>

Therefore energy will not be supplied all the time to houses or businesses who need it. The wind speed of certain days varies to as much as 10 percent, the turbine power will then also vary to 25 percent or lower. This can make a big difference in the benefit of wind power. Windmills can also cause a problem for migrating birds. When the windmills are rotating, they create noise. This throws off the migration of birds since they are easily confused by the sounds. Birds can get sucked into the blades by amount of motion caused by the windmills. The noise pollution by a few windmills is closely related to that of a small jet engine plane. Taking into account of the noise and that windmills obstructing nature's beautiful landscapes, humans may not be as easily convinced wind energy is such a great idea.]]>

You need a certain wind speed to create the electricity for the power grid, and whilthat varies by 10 percent, turbine power varies by 25 percent. Also, we must take into account that the wind is not blowing every second of every day. Without the wind blowing, there is no form of energy. Without the energy they will only create more problems than they solve. Furthermore, as noted wind turbines are very noisy, obtrusive, easily damaged and unnattractive. They are known to create noise pollution. Wind farms sound like a small jet engine. They also create an obstacle for flying animals, or migrating birds, that will have to navigate through the farms with very little outcome of them being uninjured. As for damage, wind mills are large, lightning rods. The damage fees from the lightning would very well, be more to repair than we are willing to pay. Finally, they would destroy the beauty of our rural areas. It would be like looking at the horizon, then being ruined by a big hunk of metal. All in all, wind mills are not a good choice of alternative energy. They have many pros, but the cons outweigh them.]]>

The windmill may be smart in terms of money, and when mother nature takes over and knocks out all human life for in the terms of power and electricity. Windmills will always be a smarter way to go but in the end it doesn't make them very reliable sources when it comes to electricity. Not only do you have to rely on the wind to turn the mills, but you have to make sure that it is in stable condition all times of the year. If the wind is not blowing, you have no electricity.

Windmills are great for generating energy in areas of high winds ,and the energy produced can be sold to the energy companies and they will buy from a person who owns a windmill and is not using all the energy. I think that wind energy is the way to go because it is clean, renewable, non-polluting, and quiet. Although these winmills are very popular some people do not like such things about them such as turbines are to ugly ,and have to big of a design, ruin rural lanscape , and turbine lighning damage. These are some of the things that people dislike about windmills. Overall winmills are great machines that create clean renewable paermanent energy without polluting the enviorment.]]>

Althought wind energy may be a good source from which to recvieve our energy it does not seem very environmentally friendly and/or productive to ou rway of life as much as just electric energy is. It is not as much of a conviniency. As far as the notes go the design is no where near ideal and it ruins the beauty of the natural landscape provided to us by mother nature. It is an obstruction of peace as welll because of the noisy blades that must accompany windmills. They also present a danger to certain airborne animals that may be migrating and meet an unfair fate of flying into one of these spinning death machines. All in all im not quite convinced whether or not we should have more of these windmills, they seem to have more negatifce repurcutions than positive.]]>

Wind is renewable, clean, and it provides enough energy to power an average sized town. there are a few compications with wind some times it will blow to hard and pushes the blades faster then thier ment to go then the workers have to turn the blades so that the wind isnt pushing them. the advantage fo windmills is that they are placed high enough where the wind is blowing and is the same speed all the time. wind mill are a great way to produce energy.

I think its actually more efficient and productive for our society as a whole, if you look at it from an economic point of view it is a lot less costly than running a generator all day long and having to pay the electrical compaines an abundant amount of money every month. It is also more enviornmentaly friendly than having gas fumes pump out of a generator every single second, sure people might be concerned about birds and wildlife but lets look at the bigger picture here.]]>

There are some adventages to having renewable energy but that does not out way the negatives. Having this energy will only take out more forests, mountains, building. There could also be multiple hazardes such has lighting damage, and harm to the animals. This would not be a great idea because the disruptions this will cause.

For example, the blades of the windmills are very noisy, big, and ugly. Areas where there are many windmills are called wind farms.The noise from all the blades turning sounds like a small jet engine.They would definatly be annoying to look at and hear if you lived near them. Because the windmills are so big, the odds of them getting struck by lightning increase. The windmills would be placed in rural areas of the country where thunderstorms are popular. If a windmill would be damaged by lightning, the repair would be very expensive. Other problems with wind energy include the disruption of the natural environment. A big problem is that wind varies in speeds, and it is not very consistant. Wind is caused by a change in air pressure, and if this doesn't occur, no energy would be produced. The turbines also endanger wildlife, like migrating birds. The big blades could easily kill a whole flock of geese. Clearly we cannot rely on wind as energy.]]>

Noisy blades continuously spinning around can become aggravating to the people that spend time in the area. Although wind power would be helpful to the enviornment, it would hurt the economy because many people would not like to be in the area. The enviornment would improve in the sense that there would hopefully be less pollution, but many wildlife could be in danger. Migrating animals flying through the air could become injured if they hit a blade.

Noise polution is the first major form of this, a small wind farm can sound more like a small jet engine in high winds, causing discomfort to everyone living in the area. Another drawback is the threat to migrating birds, these birds are a customed to flying certain paths, and when a wind turbine is installed in this path the birds will often times simply fly through the turbine. THus creating a bird smootie. The final nail in the coffin for these turbines is the fact that they are simply an eye sore, they are ugly and not many people want to look out of their window only to see a massive, ugly, windfarm.]]>

People spend 100- 400 dollars maybe more on food and now they spend even more that will be good for bussiness. When people start not having all that money to spend it will hurt and for those people that just bought food and bbecause the there's no energy the milk went bad and now they have to spend double the amount on the same product. Another thing is that not everybody likes the way they look most people say they are too big, ugly, or endangerment to animals. I agree that they are too big they would take up too much space. they are suppose to be healthy for the earth but the towing and building to put just one of those in is a lot of pollution. They are all so a big endangerment to animals for when migrating. the birds the size of a hand in a flock to go aginst a twenty feet by thirtyfive feet metal blade there is going to be a lot of birds going down each season of migrating and what happens when they put a bird at the edge of extinction. Also jet Engines are not healthy for the planet either so using twentyfive percent turbine power and the noise it makes makes it even more endangering.]]>

Another problem with wind power is it distrupts people lifes and interferes with wildlife. Wind turbines are not small machines. These large, unappealing machines cover hundreds of miles and are ruining rural landscapes. This vast amount of space is no longer functional because these noisy machines take up a large amount of land. Not only does it cause a problem for building homes and business, but also it disrupts the wildlife. Birds cannot fly freely without risking being hit by the huge rotating blades.

They often don't think about the damages and bad things that wind turbines are associated with. Wind turbines are not a good idea because of many reasons. These include that the wind is not blowing all the time, damage to the turbines because of lightning and other natural occurances, and that it is a bad thing for the wildlife. Although the wind blows frequently, it is not an everyday occurance. Especially in the summer months the wind blows less frequently and it doesn't blow hard enough to create enough energy for the turbines to work effectivly. This would cause power shortages or outages to the facitulies that used the energy created by the turbines. As much as the government would like to use these, the more problems they would be faced with. Another issue that wind turbines would create is damage during large storms. When the wind blows and lightning begins to strike, damage takes place. These turbines would be in the perfect location for lightning to strike them. In large open fields with even larger metal objects. There would be more money spent in replacing these items then not. And lastly, the enviroment would take a toll because of these turbines. Wildlife thrive on the objects in these areas for shelter, food and even water. These turbines would endanger the species of animals, and insects, living in these areas.]]>

For one when large migrations of birds come through a wind farm they can be potentially killed or severly injured by wind turbines. The wind also does not blow all of the time, so these wind turbines could potentially use all the power they make by just sitting idily. The blades make a noisy &quot;Whooshing&quot; sound constantly, so if one is by your house good luck sleeping for the next couple of years. Let's not forget they are huge eye sores; they truely do have a face only an enviormentalist could love. Another thing is that no trees could be planted anywhere near these structures, because they could obstruct wind from getting to them, so &quot;going green&quot; doesn't nessarily mean actually going green. A final argument to leave this debate on is: in the most windiest areas in our country such as Kansas or other midwestern states, there are also frequent tronadoes and severe lightning storms. Unless anyone wants to keep replacing wind turbine parts I beilieve we should look toward a different outlet of clean energy.]]>

There are citizens in America who view the use of wind turbines as bad. These people have several reasons such as the amount of noise, endangering wildlife, and the &quot;ugly&quot; design of the wind turbine. These people do not think we should use wind energy. The design of the windmill is not to look pretty but, to work as efficiently as possible. Some say that these modern looking turbines take away form the rural look of the beautiful country side. The amount of noise, similiar to that of a small jet engine, also disrupts the peaceful elegance of the country. To top off all of the ways the windmills take away from the country side is the fact that they pose a threat to migrating birds. The unsuspecting birds fly right by the windmill and out of nowhere comes a giant blade that knocks them out of the sky.]]>

As listed at the end of this students excerpt, there are almost more ways that wind enery is a disadvantage rather than an advantage. You can not always count on windmill's to help make the energy needed to light your house. On cold, still days when there's no wind and you are dependent of this windmill you will just be out of luck. Days like these will occur more often than the days that an unexpected power outage would occur. Its hard to believe that people would destroy mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures for something they do not one-hundred percent know that it will work. Not only does these &quot;too big, ugly designed&quot; wind energy tools affect our living it also affects our wildlife. Through the years some western and mid-western places in the United States have taken advandage of this technology, as said in the excerpt. By taking advantage of these they have created large collections of windmills called wind farms. In order to make these wind farms they would have to clear a large area of space. This meaning that thousands of widlife's homes would be destroyed. As bad as this sounds, unbelievably it does get worse. It also puts endangered wildlife and migrating birds as risk.]]>

Other types of power plants give off bad polution into the air or radioactive waste. Wind energy is recently becoming one of the most cost-effective technologies being used. It provides energy to people in rural areas that lack electric service. It can also be used during times of disaster, such as after hurricanes or power outages. It is a renewable source of energy that will never run out. Although wind energy can be used as a great source of energy, it also has it's disadvantages. For example, The wind doesn't blow 24/7! The blades of the windmill are very noisy to surrounding citizens as well. Those blades of the windmill are large, and are not attractive to people looking at the landscape. The blades are also endangering the nearby wildlife, like migrating birds. Another example of why windmills arent always a good thing would be that there could be obstructions. Such as the forest, mountains, or even building and other man-made structures.]]>

One reason that they are not effective is that windmills don't always have enough wind to produce energy. Even if the wind is blowing the speed can cause flucuations in the amount of power generated, making wind power an unreliable source of energy. Another reason wind energy is not effective is that land has to be cleared for wind farms to be created. This can lead to deforestation and the endangerment of wildlife. Overall wind energy is less productive and more destructive than it is worth to try and harness wind energy.]]>

They are great when electricity goes out, and there is no other option to get power; wind turbines will be a good resource. This is because it uses natural things to run it. Not everyday is it windy, but on days that it is, you can save all the energy you create. Although, the wind doesn't blow 24/7 to produce energy. Wind Turbines will save our country millions of dollars in the long run, but getting them started will cost a fortune too. What most people want is something thats fancy when it meets the eye. The look of turbines can ruin the lucious landscape of the rural areas, and make them look more industrial. When building them, you can take away natural habitats of forests, mountains, and buildings. Another worry is about the species that travel through the air, that could run into the enormous blades. Turbine blades are very noisy, you can hear them from outside or inside your house, depending on how close you are too them. Wind turbines are constructed of metals, therefore during thunderstorm or lightning storms they can cause danger. They can be struck by lightning with can damage other things around them, by the fire it creates. Also, the turbine itself does not create many pollutions, its considered very energy efficient. But it does create one kind of polution, like noise polution. The small jet engines can create many noise problems for wildlife, and for humans.]]>

Some disadvantages are more important and more noticable than others. For example, the windmills will not necessarily be blowing 24/7 because of the lack of wind to power them. When the windmills aren't being powered then there is nothing turing the electric generator that is being used to produce energy. Also, along with the lack of wind to power the windmills, the wind speed varies by 10% with the turbine power varying by 25%. Other disadvantages that comes from the use of windmills for wind energy have to do with the size of the windmills. The wind turbines are too big, seem to have an ugly desige, and ruin rural landscape. With them being the size that they are the turbines also are damaged by lightning, and they endager wildlife like migrating birds. With windmills being the size that they are, there are many obstructions that get in the way. Forests, mountains, buildings and other man-made structures make it hard to place these giant windmills.Finally, the last two advantages that come with using windmills for wind energy would be the noise. The blades are extremely noisy which causes noise pollution. As you can see there are many good advantages that come from the use of windmills for wind energy, but also there are disadvantages that need to be taken into consideration in order to be happy with the placement of these very large and noisy windmills.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Even though there are many good and credible ideas about using wind energy, there are also ideas that wind energy is actually intrusive and depletes natural resources. For example, putting up the wind mills requires forests and mountains to essentially be destroyed. Also the wind is not blowing 24/7, so that means that you will not have electricity by wind for the entire day or night if you need electricity. Another problem is the migration of birds. With the wind mills that stand tall in the sky, migrating birds will have to fly through those and would be endangered because of the blades. The wind mills would cut off the migration path for other animals as well. The noise from the wind mills is also disruptive. People living close to a wind mill farm would not be able to do anything in peace because of the noise from the blades. People have said that the sound is like a small jet engine. The turbines do nothing to help the landscape, in fact, they essentially destroy the beautiful scenery with the big, ugly designs. Wind Power may be a clean energy source, but it is very intrusive and gives no meaning to the phrase &quot;peace and quiet&quot;.]]>

Plus it doesn't only affect humans, but it also creates many problems between other animals' lifestyles. The windmills obstruct sights and view, visual contamination. This source of power is sometimes useless because the wind is really variable. It may not be windy one day, a week or a whole month, so if we were depending on this kind of energy source, there would be many times where we would be out of any ind of energy. The windmills do have a contamination. It is called visual contamination. The only places where windmills can be placed are landscapes where the wind blows a lot. Those places are usually in the country, where no big cities are around. The big structure of this windmills makes the landscape ugly. It does not only afect us humans, but many other animals are severly affected by the influence of this montruocities. The birds that are migrating may crash with the blades of the windmills and die, and this way the population of that kind of bird will decrease and thhey will migrate to a different place, evading the mills.]]>

What would happen to a whole farm if there was a lightning storm and it destroyed all of the trubines, then you have to put more money into the turbines than what you are getting out of them. From personal expericance I belive that wind turbines are a great idea, as long as you dont have to cut down trees to make room for more, like in the Dakotas there are alot of turbines but the biggest factors are destroying wildlife migratrions, birds running into the blades and not generating enough power, if you have say 100 turbines in an area and only 10 are blowing that isnt making alot of power all of them should be blowing to get more power, so either put them in the places where theres the most amount of wind, then you are making more lives better.]]>

Where wind power falls short is in this area, with costly downtime from lightning damage, obstructions blocking wind flow, variasions in speed and the simple fact of the wind does not blow 24/7. These factors make wind power difficalt to imagine as a feasible power source for the worlds energy damands. On the other hand the social and personal issues assosiated with wind power also make it hard to sell people on the idea. Issues like Endangered wildlife and migratin birds getting killed or seriously hurt by the rotating blads, or the noise and size concerns make current wind power socially hard to support. These are just some of the current issues affecting wind powers valididty as a power option for the world, yet wind power should not be overlooked. With costs dropping and power damands still rising, the ability to power the world with non-renewable fuels is running out, wind power is growing in poplarity]]>

One example would be the wind not blowing 24/7. This could impact many things. For instance sometimes you would not be able to get electricity if the wind is not blowing. The whole area that was being provided electricity by the wind farm would be in a state of flux because no energy was being created. Thus, setting up a potential crisis created by using wind energy. Another reason would be that it endangers wildlife. This is a major concern, because this can actually happen and be a major problem. In order to construct the wind turbins, you need to clear the area of wildlife and landscape in order to begin a construction project. This could kill many animals and threaten the existance in the surrounding area. Also, the creation of wind farms devistate the land around it. Many trees are foced to be uprooted, and flowers and other natural habitats may be destroyed in order to produce this new form of energy.]]>

From the information i was given their are many pointas that vna be argued against. For instance one of those points is that &quot;Turbines are too big,ugly design,ruin rural landscape.&quot; there are many of those who think that wind mills are not that. Then again there are those who think that they are. Coming from a rual community myself; I belive that wind mills are a great invention. Even tho there aren't any around whear I live, and wish that they were possibly a few. Surly there are people who have never seen one before and more than likely think that they are fasinating. I have fortunatly enough have seen one and been up close to one. Another point that one argue agaisnst is that they have &quot;Noisy blades&quot;. you can't hear them from far away. You could stand a football feild length away or even two and you still couldn't really hear it. If you were really up close to one than sure you can hear the blades turning. But thats if you are all up close and personal. Now, if you lived by one whole life than you just get used to it being there and probably hardly notive the sound it makes and/or its pressence. Those are just a few points that one can argue against. There are a lot more and many differnet views one can look at it. Everyone has there own opinon about something. And this is my in take of it.]]>

Wind power use in the United States is ineffective and has a disadvantage to other sources of energy. Windmills are an annoyance to rural America. Farmers are annoyed by the huge ugly physical attributes windmills tend to have. It is ruinous to the rural landscape. Farmers also criticize the sound the windmills admit. The windmills produce a sound equivolent to the sound of a small plane engine. Windmills are easliy affected by other factors that make them not efficient. Lightning strikes hit windmills often wasting taxpayers money. Windmills also affect the nature that it is near such as endagered wildlife and migrating birds. There are too many variable that go into windmills that make them ineffective.]]>

Such as noisy blades, not blowing as often as needed, obstructions, and many others. Noisy blades can be a distraction to anyone, if they machines are near any small towns, the wilderness, or anywhere really. Another problem with wind energy is that if it worked, and we became dependant on it, we would only beable to use it when it was windy enough outside to use it. Also, if we were to use wind energy, the wind mills would be ginourmous im sure and would cause having to take out wilderness, ruin buildings and other man-mad structures.]]>

The view points often discussed cover everything from noise pollution to a clean energy source. Though some might say wind energy is a good and clean source of energy, there are a great many things to consider; such as: Turbine lightning damage, migrating birds, unreliable wind conditions, obstructions, and the loss of beauty in rural landscapes. Wind turbines should not be used as a primary source of power, as there are to many conditions that have to be met for them to be effective. Such as the unreliablillity of a constant wind source, or the fact of a fire hazard during storms that might have lightning. Not only do wind turbines pose a problem in these aspects, but they might also negatively affect the bird populations, as they migrate south for the winter. In consession wind energy, is infact a clean energy source, and are rather cost effective for their intended usages. Also they have been proven useful historically, and are becoming more efficient as technology improves, but they also are area limited as obstructions may occur such as forests or cities/ residential areas, and the no small matter of destrution of the natural landscape's beauty.]]>

In this paragraphs above, the student explains what Wind Energy is and gives good examples as to why Wind Energy is a great, non polluted source of energy. But even with the pros listed above, there are still reasons as to why Wind Energy is not the main source of energy, for example the wind does not blow 24/7 unless you live in cutbank montana. The blades are too big and ugly in design and ruin rural landscape. Also, by putting all of the giant turbines up, it causes a significant amount of danger to migrating birds, as those turbines could take out a whole flock or so. Last but not least on the list is the amount of noise the turbines make. A small wind farm is as loud as a small fighter jet, which has a significant amount of noise for being so small.]]>

Taking from his/her notes, the wind doesn't always blow, so when the wind doesn't blow the turbin isn't spinning and making wind energy for you. Also, you have to clear out a lot of space for a wind turbin, most of them are very large and can take up a lot of space. Another thing that could effect the wind energy produced is the wind speed, if the speed is fast the blades are going to turn fast and create more energy. However, if the wind does not blow very fast the blades are not going to spin very fast and not make as much wind energy. As far as endagering wildlife such as birds, the blades could hurt and or kill some birds but the birds hitting the blades could also damage the blades on the turbin.]]>

The windmills used to generate wind energy are bulky and ugly; they can ruin the beauty of a rural landscape, and send property values plummeting as they do. In addition to their unsightliness, these turbines are LOUD--about the decibel level of a small jet engine. Most people don't want to live near windfarms due to their unattractive and noisy disruption. In addition, many remote areas are not viable options for wind farms. Any large obstructions, including forests and mountains, will interfere with airflow and render wind energy ineffective. Also, an area has to be very windy for most of the year in order for wind energy to be useful--a decrease in wind speed of only 10% will decrease the amount of power generated by about 25%. In addition to their impracticality, wind farms are not nearly as &quot;green&quot; as most people assume. Despite the fact that they don't generate any fuel or radioactive waste, windmills still have a negative impact on the environment. The large structures create a great deal of noise, disrupting the natural landscapes in which they are so often placed. The windmills can attract lightning strikes, which sometimes cause fires. Also, the turbine blades kill migrating birds, including many endangered species. Overall, despite their advantages, wind farms are too impractical--and too dangerous--to become a major energy source for Americans.]]>

On the other hand they can be very dangerous too. Such as wind is not availible 24/7, which is needed to perform this kind of energy making structure. The blades are noisy and not only that but they can be very harmful to mother nature, such as a flock of birds flying around the windmill can get caught in them and die. Windwills can also take away the scenery by being big obstructions in the middle of forest, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. This is a problem not mostly for the danger but just the look of it within all these things listed. Windmills are great to have as a back up for energy or for one just on its own, but there are many negatives that come with it as well and every one should research both sides of the story before making a decision to have a wind farm.]]>

Like for say the cost of residential wind power turbines have decreased 60% and their efficiency has increased but having more of these turbines has endangered wildlife such as migrating birds. giving customers the opportunity to pay more for electricity that comes from renewable sources to support new technologies could be a great way of not polluting the air also but itd be constant wind blowing 24/7- wind speed varies by 10% and turbine power varies by 25%; noise pollution, the blades are noisy; and were taking the risk of all these turbines getting lightning damage. Not only do we not want wind all the time but we also dont want obstruction of the forests, mountains, buildings, and other man made structures and with such powerful turbines and trying to get more to use them for electricity; its a great idea dont get me wrong, but theyll ruin our lands and our homes.]]>

However, Wind Energy isn't totally flaw less. One important disadvantage of Wind Energy is that the Wind isn't blowing all the time, so the Wind Energy can't support the whole U.S. electricity, it always needs other resources to support the energy. So at times when there is no Wind blowing, the other energy sorces work full power. Wind Energy is called a &quot;clean energy&quot; but what nobody talkes about is, that the Turbines are loud and they stand in the rural landscapes. By having noise pollution,they ruin the nature in these parts, they endanger the wildlife and also endanger the migrating birds in the natural areas, like in the forests, in the mountains. All these rural landscapes get more people to go there to repair and built the Turbines and that causes human footsteps there, like trash and gases from the cars and mashines and from all the fields, more and more wind farmes are bulit where once was a rural landscape. The Wind Energy isn't completely outworked yet, they have small jet engines and the technic to completely use Wind isn't good enough yet. To get enough energy out of this source its important to built a alternative to it, so when no wind is blowing the housholds have other sources to get the needed energy.]]>

Right now we need to focus on the money problem and i think investing in windmill this would help with the money problem that we are having right now. Also, even though it hurts the enviroment it also helps it to. Yes, the noise pollution part is bad but if you are looking at it, windmills do not have any harmful gases, oiles, or coal. This also goes hand in hand with endangering migrating birds, because if windmills did have harmful gases or thing coming out of it, it would be harming all the wildlife through the air, and i believe if having to maybe hurt one animal compared to a ton more of animals its ok. I believe windmills would be a good idea to get and that it would help with a lot of problems that we have today. Just like everything else in the world everything has it ups and down, but some have more ups than its downs and i believe that windmills are one of them that has more ups!]]>

You don't have to pay for wind, you just get it no matter what. Wind generates almost anything you would want it too. Wind is also reusable! Wind power doesn't pollute the air or cause any harm in any way. In paragraph 3 it states &quot; Wind becomes the sole source of power during times when the electrical grid is out, especially when enduring hurricanes, power outages, or brown outs. Wind is an excellent supplement to other renewable resources such as solar and hydroelectric power.&quot; In that paragraph it gives nothing but positive feedback. Changing the worlds source of energy to being performed by Wind Energy could be a very positive thing.]]>

Wind power is both not effecient as the wind speed and power out put varies and the wind does not blow all day every day. Wind power is also a danger to migating birds and natural habitats. Wind power is rather ineficiant as the wind does not blow all the time and the turbins dont provide a steady suply of power Wind is not a sure thing some times the wind does blow and some times it dosent and i belive that it is not good thing to rely on such an unsteady sourse for what runs our lives, power. with out the ability to store the power we can not rely on these sourses for power expecialy mentioning that the turbines them selves power out put varries by 25%! as you can see wind power is verry unreliable Wind power is also detrementle to the wild life and land scape. The turbines can kill and mame migrating birds, each year more and more birds continue to die for this unreliable source of power. It also decimats the land under them as is need to be cleared for maintnence and costruction destroying thousands of animals homes and the places natural sceny. As I have pointed out wind power is verry enviromentialy bad.]]>

For example, wind turbines are very large, and cannot be built just anywhere. Because of their large, metalic structure, wind turbines are prime targets for lightning strikes. The large, noisy blades also create a hazard for migratory birds. They also can ruin the landscape. Also, wind doesn't always blow 24/7, and when the wind speed is slower, the turbines produce less energy.]]>

The benefits are obvious, with the clean energy source, but there's more disadvantages then I think we've contemplated. Wind Power isn't efficient because the wind isn't always blowing, and the blades are very noisy. It would take away from enjoying the quiet peace of nature, plus the turbines are too big, ruining rural landscape with its ugly design. We've been taking away from nature enough as it with pollution, deforestation, and forcing animals from their habitat with our new technology. Turbines of the Wind Power would effect forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. It could also endanger the wildlife, and endanger migrating birds. The wind speed varies by 10%, and turbine power varies by 25%, so the problem of having enough wind is inevitable. The Wind Power option for electricity is very expensive. Lightening can damage the turbines, and I'm sure the cost to repair it would weigh heavily upon the debt of already installing it. The reason for creating the wind powered turbines is so there's less pollution for our economy, but it creates more noice pollution than anything else.]]>

First of all, wind does not blow all of the time so when there is a lack of wind, sufficient energy cannot be produced. Another disadvantage is in the design of the turbines. Their blades cause disruptions because of the extreme level of noise that they generate, equivalent to that of a small jet engine, and these turbines are way too big, ugly in design, and alltogether ruin the rural landscape in which they are placed. In addition, Obstructions in wind flow by forests, mountains, buildings and other manmade structures can cause these turbines to not receive enough wind either. More still, these wind farms can impeach on the habitats of endangered wildlife and migrating birds and are highly sucecptible to lightning damage. All in all, there are many disadvantages that need to wieghed when considering wind power as a viable source of energy.]]>

Early 1900s, smaller towns started using windmills for someting different. They used it to create electricity. Ever since then, wind energy has been popular in rural areas. Windmills should be used for their original purpose. There isn't always going to be wind, thats mother nature's call. Small towns that contain wind farms will have to deal with the noise coming from these windmills, which creates disturbances. Wind speed isn't guarenteed also. Animals are as much a part of this world as we are. We have to put them into consideration when deciding where to put wind farms. Wind farms are essential for this idea of wind energy to work, but there isn't a place for them. These wind farms disrupt the wildlife and migrating birds.]]>

Yes, they can be noisy, ruin the environment, take up to much space and not work all day and night 365 days a year, but the good outweighs the bad. Windmills are a safer and better product for the environment much more than they are a harm to it. Instead of using hazerdous powerlines that can easily cause electrocution they work only if the wind is blowing. The workers who set up these giant windmills strategically place in areas that are almost windy every day of the year. Windmills also help with the pollution problems we are having today, because they work soul on wind there is no pollution or radioactive waste coming from them.

The turbines can only work if the wind is blowing, if not the turbines will not create any energy because they have no source to get it from. Turbines are usually large and are built in groups which can sometimes be a large number. These sights take up land and ruin sightseeing for some. The turbines are also a hazard to migrating birds, that sometimes hit hte blades of the turbine which usually will result in death from blunt force trama. Death of birds which are endangered is a large problem with no reasonable solution except for removing the wind turbines completely. Each turbine requires on small jet engine to work properly. If the engines malfunction, a worker must scale a ladder up sometimes hundreds of feet to be able to work on the engine.]]>

Using Wind Energy is overall, more trouble than it's worth. Windmills generate electricity or power through blades, which like airplane wings, are lifted by air flow, which causes them to rotate. The rotation of the blades is connected to a drive shaft which causees an electric generator to turn and creates electricity. Although people across America have used windmills for centuries, there have always been many problems with it's use. Wind is not very reliable, meaning it doesn't blow all the time. If the wind doesn't constantly blow, they will need to have larger and faster gusts of wind in order to make up for the time that the generators aren't producing electricity. As well as being unreliable, it's loud. the blades make sounds that are not something one wants to hear all the time. The noise may also disrupt wildlife habitats and cause changes in where birds and other animals make their homes in certain seasons. The turbines may also cause harmful changes to the migrating patterns of birds and could also be detrimental to endangered species. To add to the list, windmills are an eyesore. These oversized turbines disrupt the landscape, they are ugly in design and ruin the pure look of the land. No one driving through practically untouched land, full of grace and beauty, wants to see big, clunky windmills overcrowding and invading the peace of the rural landscape. Windmills may be efficient and don't produce detrimental wastes, but they aren't worth the time or money to put up. They are more of a liability than an asset and cause many hazards and problems. The negative effects outweigh the positive in this case and no matter how many good things it has, there are always the bad things, which are greater, to ruin it all.]]>

Wind turbines create a large amount of noise which contributes to the ever growing issue of noise pollution. Not only does this occur, but it destroys natural areas. They are usually placed in large open spaces, destroying habitats of animals of these areas. Unfortunately, as turbines operate, birds sometimes enter their path and are killed, as birds move in mass migration this can be devastating to a flock. Since the turbines are so tall, during thunderstorms, lightning can strike them and cause serious damage to the systems. In addition, wind is not a certain source for energy as wind only occurs when low and high pressure systems meet so when days are windless, the turbines prove ineffective.]]>

The regular household uses tons of energy on a daily basis whether it is blender or a nightlight our lives revolve around energy. Wind isn't always blowing at the same rate or speed so the engery being gained by the mills won't be consistant, it will vary. Wind power has many faults, one of which is that its not windy 24/7 therefore if there isn't any power stocked up one would have to go without power and that is just an inconvienence. Forests, mountains, and buildings are some of the many things that can obsturct wind from getting to the wind mills, which wind speed usually rates at 10% and the turbines in the mills get to 25%. Wind mills also have several effects on nature, they're noisy and ward away wildlife. They tend to scare away birds that are migrating to and from the area effecting where they will end up. Since there is metal in wind turbines it is also a magnet to lightening which could result in fires and power loss, since that would/might be the towns only source in power. Although wind power is &quot;better for the environment&quot; these bulky things cause more problems then their worth. They aren't reliable nor are they safe. We as energy dependant human beings should stick to our fossil fuels, as bad as they are, we would benefit from them more then we would wind energy.]]>

When it comes to windmills the birds migrating could potentially fly too close to the spinning blades of the windmills and end up becoming seriously harmed or killed. The windmills blades move pretty fast and are big, the speed and mass of the windmill creates a force that would most likely kill an oncoming bird or birds. Then there is the fact that the wind isn't always blowing where the windmills have been set, and if the wind were to stop then no power would come to the area using those specific windmills.

At the end of the day if your design isn't gorgeous than no one will want to use it. Even if it does generate 3% of the total U.S. electricity because looks is what it's all about. No person is going to want to live near a big ugly, noisy windmill even if it can power about 12 million households. All that matters is the way it looks. A huge windmill in your back yard could really lower the real estate value of your home. The wind isn't blowing at all times anyway so why take the risk? Why not just rely on nuclear, solar or hydroelectric power? There will always be sun and water right? Windmills also endanger the wildlife. At the end of the day the pigeons and crows are more important than our countries power needs. We can deal with a few burnt out lightbulbs as long as there are still birds in the sky. I say we get rid of wind energy all together becuase all they do is make backyards look ugly and endanger nature.]]>

First, the wind turbine is not always blowing. This causes for there to be a fluxuation in the amount of power any given turbine produces, whereas other sources of energy can be generated whenever wanted. Also, because of the height of these turbine and the blades they have on them, they commonly kill birds that are migrating. This causes major disruption in the food chain and could ultimately result in the destruction of an entire animal ecosystem. Because of these reasons it is easy to see that although it is a clean source of energy, the effects of this energy is just as bad as any other]]>

Using wind as energy is very much like using solar power with the sun. The sun is a continuous light source that will never fail us and will always give us energy. People that use Solar Panels for their houses save a lot of money each month on their power bills. Using wing energy can benefit us in the same way. Using wind power is also enviromentally friendly and is all natural. Some of the downfalls of using wind power is wind is not continous. Some days are really windy whereas other days are not windy at all. The inconsistence of wind can be bad for the poeple trying to gain power. These wind power machines are also very big and take up a lot of room and some say that it can ruin rural landscape. Overall I think the preos of wind power outweigh the cons.]]>

Unfortunately, not all natural resources can be utilized at all times of the day, month, or year. A popular choice for replacing fossil fuel is harnessing the wind, but there are many downfalls to using this. Wind turbines create a lot of energy -- when they are in use. The wind does not blow all day or even all year, so at times the machines will be sitting dormant. On top of that, these turbines ruin the rural landscape and obstruct forests and mountains and migrating bird patterns -- something the environmentalists will highly disagree with. If states and countries are going to invest in the wind turbine, they should consider the harm these machines might be doing to the environment.]]>

There is no way to have a solid dependence on the element because of the constant shifts that come with the wind. Firstly, wind is not always blowing. Wind Power leaves residents to the sporadic hands of weather. There are days and weeks where there is little more than a rustle in the trees. People cannot be left without energy and power in such times. Secondly, wind sped varies. As its tempo shifts by 10%, the turbine power varies in turn by 25%. This fluctuation and significant effect in power is inefficient, and ultimately inconsistent. Residents need to be able to rely on a successful source of energy, not something that lacks stability.

Wind energy is not gaurenteed to blow 24/7 and the blades it has, are too noisy for the turbines. The turbines are too big, ugly designed, and it will ruin rural landscape. These turbines causes obstruction to forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. Turbines will cause a great deal of noise pollution by making wind farms, with small jet engine, for the turbines.

A few thing that can be a problem with wind generaters is the cost to own or build one, the amount of open area it needs, the unreliability of them, and the usual wear and tear of them. First of all anyone who really supports wind power will most likely want their own wind generator, but is not able afford the cost of building one. To get enough open room for one without any obstructions in the way can also be a problem for some people. Another is how reliable will it be and will it ever be able to pay for itself? Also one last problem with it can be the cost for maintence for it, because every mechanical mechinism eventually wears apart and will need replacement part.]]>

They are helping the environment more than they are hurting. During a power outage or brown out, they come in handy when you have no power. Plus you can never run out of wind! Some people say they ruin man-made structures when windmills are not the only things that do that. If we were to say that, then what about houses, stores, roads, etc.? They may not have the prettiest design but nothing in life is ever going to please everyone. They help people out in the time of nee so thats all that should matter.

They are saying that the wind energy does not blow all the time. When above it doesn't say anything about the time frame of the wind blowing. They talk about the blades in great detail in the passage above, in which the students notes he/she had that the turbines are too big, ugly and they can ruin the rural landscape. They also talk about the obstructures, wind speed and what the wind turbines can do to nature. They could ruin wildlife.

The unreliability of wind brings the first disadvantage. Even though society makes vast strides in weather-detecting technology every year, we still do not have the ability to tell how often the wind will blow in the next several years. As such, there lies a possibility that the government could spend millions of dollars on wind farms only for there to exist no wind for a majority of the time. Also, if we started to rely on wind power more heavily then there would be consequenses for a lack of wind like blackouts or power failures. The endangering of wildlife brings the second disadvantage. Wind turbines create quite a danger when one truly thinks about it. Large portions of migrating bird flocks could recieve injury or death from flying into turbines. The possibility of wind turbines getting damaged by lighting brings the third disadvantage. Wind turbines, usually made of metal, could easily act as giant lightning rods. The lightning strikes would damage the turbines if not flat out destroy them, making them needed to be fixed or unusable.]]>

Wind energy is very resourceful, but the wind is not blowing twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. The weather in a specific area is not always consistent, so wind energy can not be reliable all the time. Wind speed varies by ten percent. Turbine power varies by 25 percent. This is a large difference of inconsistency that is not dependable.The use of windmill blades creates loud noises. This can disturb people in the surrounding area of the windmills. Because the turbines are so massive, the rural landscape is becoming ruined. When looking out into the open prairie, all that is seen in the windmills and not the natural landscape. Windmills create obstructions to the forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. Windmills can also hurt endangered wildlife and migrating birds. When windmills are built and put up in areas, wildlife is affected. The wildlife must adapt to the change and more some animals that is not easy. Turbines can become easily damaged in storms. Lightning can strike the turbine and cause destruction to it. Not only that, but also the fact that the wind turbines create large noise pollution and can disturb area neighbors.]]>

I also think it is a good idea, the use wind farms for energy. the resources that we are using now might not aways be availible in the future. wind will aways be around and we will never run out of it. they say they are two big, but that might be the only efficent design for them too work the best. so in conclusion i think over all wind turbindes are a good idea to creat clean energy.]]>

This can also endanger wild life because birds can fly right into a blade because they just don't see them and a lot of birds are killed every year by wind turbines. And last of all there are a lot of obstructions because it is powered by wind that means that nothing can be in the winds way or the turbine wont create as much energy. So i hope there are more advantages but i think we will have to wait for the future.]]>

Withing this student's notes, some of the opposing view points rest upon the constancy of the wind, the clunky design of the turbine, the threats that turbines pose to animals, and the obtrusive noises that the turbine produces. Each of these are valid reasons to why wind energy with the use of turbines many not be appropriate or helpful to the enviornment, and the nature surrounding it. The student is effectively able to tear down many pro arguments that may center around the helpful aspects it poses towards nature, or the quiet sounds that it may emit. In this way, the con arguments rest upon the degradation of nature overall, something that the pro points will have to adress more heavily. Because of these points that the opposing point of view gives, it is quite easy to support the views, and how they can slowly deteriorate nature. Although the pro side states that wind is free, the con side can also effectively say that wind is not constant, therefore, wind energy can only be used in certain areas or times, not a roadblock that is run into by using other forms of energy. The pro side also claims that wind energy is not obtrusive to the enviornment, meaning it is a clean source of energy that does not emit toxins or pollutants into the air. This however is simply not true, as wind farms use small jet engines, and loud noises that in turn, scare creatures away from their habitat. Turbines also increase wildfires, as they are more susceptible to catch on fire due to lightning strikes. Not only this, but birds and other creatures living in the forest are being pushed out of their habitat, and are becoming endangered. Although the pro side can argue animal safety, they cannot deny the implications that turbines have towards wildlife. For these two main points, it is easy to support the opposing point of view.]]>

Wind turbines have been around for many years on a small scale and there has been a reason that people have kept them small, for the fact that, they have the noise polution of a small jet engine which ruins the serentiy of the country which many people value above monetary compensation. Lighting damage is another concern that those who are in favor of wind turbines often over look. The amount of light reflected and ommited from a single wind turbine is that akin to a city block on a cloudy night. Well my prior 2 concerns of wind turbines are valid arguments against theyre installation if they were present on my property, the greatest concern the is in assciation with wind turbines is the way that they kill thousands of migrating species every year disrupting their natual migration cycle and destroying local populations of birds. It is for these reasons that wind farms are obtrusive and that any self respecting citizen would not wish to see these built on his land.]]>

Some disadvantages of wind energy is that the wind may not be blowing 24/7 so does that mean we wont get the most energy? Will we have to be frugal with it? Also they are extreamly noisy machines. With the noise, many citizens may not get the sleep that they need and it also draws attention away from the quietness of these open areas where the turbines would be located. These windmills are very large, ugly to look at, and they also destroy our landscape. This to me isn't big disadvatage because it will ruin the earth but efficiency may come at a price. This may cause threats to the wildlife and migrating birds. Another reason this is a bad idea is that they are really tall peices of metal. Lightning is attracted to metal. This doesn't sound like it's going anywhere good. These are all disadvantages to look at when voting about the construction of these wind turbines.]]>

These are just a few of the many reasons why Wind Power is a disadvantage to regular electricity. Unlike regular power plants, Windmills can not be located in forests, mountains, or other man-made structures due to it being obstructions. Even if they were able to be located in these ares, Windmills would need a continuous amount of wind to power it in order to power its' facilities. Wind farms are available to produce more energy if not enough wind is available for a single windmill, but often it is only enough to power a small jet engine.Wind farms are still a viable source, but if a lighting storm rolls through, they will be susceptible to being struck and ruining the entire Wind farm.]]>

And on some days when the wind is blowing more than twenty miles an hour, the turbines are not able to run because the blades could spin to fast and break or fall off which would cause tremendous damage. Noisy blades, i do not think that the turbines are very loud, but i haven't been real close to one. Turbines too big, ugly design, ruin rural landscape the turbines could maybe be a little smaller but they are good for right now. and i think the design isnt that bad, just typical old windmill. obstructions- forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures, we can place these practically anywhere we want to, cause they dont really harm anything. and is energy that we wouldn't of used anyways. Wind speeds varies, the bad thing is that we can't use these on windy days. Endangered wildlife, a solution to this would be to make them shorter so the bird can fly over them, Turbine lightning damages, yes there big and probably attract alot of lightning but all lightning is, is energy. which is just a surge of energy]]>

For example there could be one hundred mile an hour winds one day and you would have alot of energy that day, but the next day there is not wind so no energy could be produced. If there is no wind that day no one gets any electricity for that day. Setting up these big turbines would also have a negative effect on wildlife, man would have to desrtoy animals homes to make room for the turbines. It also effects the migration of endangered birds. From how big the turbines are it would make rural landscapes ugly and un appealing to others because of there design and size.

Wind turbines are most effective in places with constantly blowing wind, which limits the area that the turbines would be effective and since the wind doesnt blow all the time there would be time where the turbine would not be generating power. Turbines can also be hazardous to wildlife in the area, mainly birds, that migrate through the land occupied by wind turbines. The turbines are also extremely loud causing as much noise as a small jet engine. Because of these points, wind energy can be seen as being a good renewable resource but not a reliable one.]]>

The only problem with wind energy is the variation in wind speed and the time that the wind blows. Yes, it is completely clean, and renewable, but it is not consistent. If all of America was run on Wind Turbines, we would experience massive blackouts during down times, because the wind doesn't always blow. We cannot rely solely on Wind, but it can be used to supplement other sources during peak times, or times when energy consumption is high. So say at night, when homes are using a lot of electricity because people are cooking dinner, and watching TV; if the wind is blowing steadily, power companies will turn of coal generators, or diesel generators, or nuclear stations. I feel like the most consistent form of power we could have, is hydroelectric. But not the current hydro, the new age hydro. Where you put a horizontal turbine on the shore of a body of water, and let the tide spin the turbine. This is the most consistent, because the tides don't stop, and they are always going. 24/7. It is clean, and the only environment impact is possible relocation of aquatic life.]]>

The large wind turbines not only stick out like a sore thumb in the countryside, but produce quite a bit of noise pollution-- as much as a small jet engine. Wind power is also not viable in anywhere that doesn't have large clearings available. Forests and urban areas provide almost no space for wind turbines, while solar panels can be place on roofing almost anywhere. Being dependent on the weather also makes wind power rather unreliable, and almost useless in areas with little weather, such as deserts. Finally, the potential for damage caused by weather is very high with wind power. Wind turbines are essentially tall metal rods hundreds of feet high. It is very likely for a turbine to be struck by lightning during a storm.]]>

So now people's view is ruined and they can't find any wildlife in the area around a turbine. To go along with that, wind power is not reliable. Sure wind will always be there, but it won't be able to produce a reliable amount of energy due to the unpredictability of wind as a resource.

There are many places with no wind, and wind turbines would not function there reliably. They would create sporatic amounts of energy, which would make it very difficult for people to power their homes and their heat or air conditioning with wind power. In addition, the wind speed varies by 10%, which makes the power of the turbines vary by 25%. This is a big discrepancy -- some people might get really strong power sources from strong winds, but as the wind changes, those power levels may drop suddenly or disappear altogther. And for every person with an abundance of wind power, there will be people on the opposite end of the scale, whose wind power is never strong enough. The big variant in the turbine power would also make it difficult to create a generator to fit both the upper end and the lower end of the scale. Because of the unreliability of wind, windmills are not a viable source of energy. Windmills are also noisy and considered ugly by many people. The blades make a lot of noise, and wind farms sound like a small jet engine. This can create a distraction or an annoyance for many people. Constantly hearing the sound of blades swishing through the air can get frustrating, or give someone a headache. But beyond just the noise they make, people think windmills are ruining the landscape. They claim the turbines are too big and an ugly design, and the rural landscape is ruined by adding windmills in. Along with that comes the environmental factor. In order to build the windmills, lots of trees have to be cut down. Opponents of windmills would argue that this is bad for the environment and effectively cancels out the energy-saving abilities of the turbines. In the process of building, animals are also killed as their habitats are destroyed, and once the windmills are up and running, it is likely that many birds will die from flying too close to the blades. This is an unnecessary cause of many deaths. Because of the flaws in their design, wind turbines have many disadvantages.]]>

Even though windmills do not blow 24/7, it is still cheaper than having to pay our own electricity. Noisy blades can become a problem for people living close to the windmills. Typically, people don't like being surrounded by noise. Building turbines in rural locations may ruin the landscape. For example, if the people decide to build turbines in the Green Mountains of Vermont, it would ruin our landscape and ruin our mountains that tourists come to see. By building turbines, it will cost a lot of money for cities. It will cause them to have to destroy a building in order to save money. Turbines can cause lots of obstructions to forests and mountains. In order to build them they would have to take down lots of trees and that destroys a lot of animal habitats. Since wind speed varies, it would mean that the turbines would be working efficiently on different days meaning that on some days they would produce more electricity than on other days. Since turbines are built tall, they can be more likely to be hit by lightning, which causes lots of damage. If they are struck by lightning, they can malfunction, causing the cities around them lots of money to fix them. Wind turbines can cause noise pollution, due to them having small jet engines. They create lots of noise.]]>

They dont produce energy all the time and when they do, the blades make a lot of noise. The design of the blades are big and ugly, ruining the beautiful landscape. Wind mills can also obstruct natural as well as man made structures. Birds can't see where the windmill blade is going and often times fly into them, causing expensive damage in return. I have seen a wind few wind farms. I have go to say that they all looked ugly. They did, in fact, make the landscape look worse. The blades wern't even moving and the wind was blowing at least 20 miles an hour. This does not seem cost affective to me. When a species is endangered, it's our job job to keep it alive. Mostly because it is most likly our fault it's endangered in the first place. Wind mills greatly harm the bird population and in some cases, they take away the environment of species native to the area. When wind mills are placed in the city, all it does is make the noise polution go up. It is illegal for too much noise to go on in a city for an extended amount of time. Wind mills easily break that law and don't even produce enouge energy to make up for it.]]>

Also, wind energy is far more cost effective than any other type of non-renewable energy, and with the increase of technological innovation the wind mills are becoming a financial bnefit rather than a financial consequence.]]>

It doesnt pollute the enviroment, it keeps it nice and pretty with all the colorful flowers and nice and big trees healthy. Anyways it does not produce radioactive waves of energy that is bad for the enviroment. These turbines generate 3% of the nations energy. These also do not consume any of our countries depleating non-renewable source, like oil ,coal, or natural gas. Wind also become one of the main sources of power when an eletric grid is out or there is hurricanes or any other tragedity. I also think there are many disadvantages of wind energy. For example lets say a flock of geese are migrating to a different part of the state and they fly right through these huge turbines. I wonder whats going to happen to them? They arent going to be non-exssitent. But anyways these huge turbines can endanger wildlife and be obstructions to forest,buildings, mountains, and other man made structures.]]>

Next, some people may complain that the noisy blades is a problem. You could live next to the loud noise so it may keep you awake. The windmill may also be an ugly destraction for some people. They think that a farm should be all crops, not a big, ugly windmill in the way. One big negative factor could be that birds may fly straight into the blades. This could kill off many birds. Last, the small jet engine could be a pollution. The last thing farmers want is to have thier crops dying off because of pollution.]]>

(Line 1) Windmills do create energy, but is it really the best way to produce it? The disadvantages of wind energy are far too much. For example, the windmills do not blow 24/7. Which means that energy is not being produced the whole time. There is always someone awake in the world, and living in our times, everyone utilizes a ton of energy no matter what it's for. The humungous windmills take acres and acres of land, and ruin the rural landscape. Especially if forests are being torn down to make room for these windmills. Trees might not provide the same energy as these windmills, but they keeping us alive by producing oxygen to give to us humans, who are now tearing them down to make windmills for our own use. Reffering to the previous paragraph, by tearing down forests for the windmills, it is also destroying the ecosystem and wildlife. Those are animal's homes and we do not have the right to tear them down. Those animals that live there would either have to migrate somewhere else or they would die in that part of the land, causing the whole food cycle of that area to be destroyed. Animals don't raid and destroy our suburban neighborhoods to let them hunt for their food. Why should we do that to them?]]>

Also, the turbines themselves are very big, not good to look at and ruin the natural landscape which they inhabit. These turbines are also obstructions in many areas such as forests, mountains, buildings and man made structures. Other reasons why these turbines have disadvantages is that the wind speed is not always constant. The wind can differ by as much as 10%, and the turbine power itself can itself can differ by 25%. These giant turbines are also a danger to wildlife, because they could fall over and kill animals in the forest or kill birds in the air while it is spinning. The wind turbines can also be reduce the lighting in the forest, thereby preventing trees, grass and bushes to grow. the final reason is that they can create alot of noise like a small jet engine.]]>

The description of the windmill shows highlights of what it does like; The blades being so noisy and not being able to move 24/7 because of not having any wind. The way the windmill happens to be designed the turbines being big, the way it has a ugly design and the landscape it happens to be surrounding it. Windmills weer often to be found in forest, mountains, building, and other man-made structures that the windmill can be found. In order for the windmill to be working is how the wind speed is about 10% witha power varies of 25%. The opposing point of view that I could state is by how the idea of the windmill was used for, Like how the windmill was built and what it's purpose was like before. Theses notes could be old facts about the windmill because as the years went by the descrption of the windmilll could have some improves now on how the windmill may look like and what the purpose is now used for.]]>

For assurance that people in rural areas are gonna get electricity the wind has to be blowing more than ten percent and the turbine power has to vary by twenty five percent. Having the windmills blow 24/7 can cause birds to no longer fly in that area and they will be come endangered and migrate to other safe flying places. The examples shown should be take into account on why windmills should not be used to engender electricity.]]>
