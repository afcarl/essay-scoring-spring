Last Friday night we made a record of 150 yards rushing, and interceptions, a total of 3!

Coach Wilson saidb it was agreat game team effort and was proud of the player's accomplishments. I think that some of the audience weren't happy probably they were mad or something and the other half of the audience was all happy because the team won. I say that the 8th grade Wildcats were happy because some of them are not going to play with the same team or have the sam coach for next year some might not even go to the same school and some might play v.s eachother and not have the chance to play with eachother in the same team. So as long as the team Wildcats won when they grow up they will remember when they won the East Middle School Buckaroos and they will remember there friends that were with them to win or the audience that was cheering for them.]]>

Not only did the players wear the pink sox so did the 500 people in the stands. Our coach has been coaching for a very long time but he stills says our team this year is the best team that he has ever coached.

Jose Gracia also had a great season with his one touchdown and 30 pass completions! Also you can't forget about Stacy King with that one fantastic field goal, and Jamal Jackson with his two great interceptions! Their coach says this is the best team he's coached since he started at Northside Middle School. Also players wore pink socks for cancer awareness, and you've got to respect the wopping number of 500 people that showed up to watch the Wildcats face their rivals, the Buckaroos!

Thirty eight to thirty five, the team really did do their best effort, two more points and you'd tie! Great touchdowns by Jose Garcia, Todd Whitaker, and Jason Strong. Way to go with that field goal Stacy! Good job passing the ball Jose, you showed hard effort. Jamal Jackson did two interceptions causing them to score a field goal. Not only did they win the game with incredible passes, touchdowns, interceptions, passes, and field goals they won while creating even more cancer awareness and supporting cancer. They gave out awareness by wearing pink socks and asking supporters to wear them as well. Even coach wilson said that it was the best team that he coached in Northside Middle School! All I can say is that the 8th grade football team made a good representation of the Northside Middle School last Friday night.]]>

He scored 2 touchdowns and a total of 150 yards this was essential to the Wildcats game. Jason Strong scored to touchdowns aswell. His scoring really contributeed to there win. Jason Strong was great on defense aswell how about that interception. Jamal Jackson caught 2 interceptions plays like this really help the wildcats win. What a great game the coach must have been very happy to win on cancer awareness night. He also couldnt have won to a better team winning against your long time rival. This was not a game to miss and certainly no one missed it because it was a packed house of 500 spectators. This will be a game remebered forever.]]>

Stacy king made one field goal and Jose King also made 30 pass completions. There were over 500 fans on the stands watching the game and cheering for the Wildcats. What a game, you had to be there , you woud have been on your toes the whole time. The coach said it was an amazing game and that this was the best team he was coached ever since he started coaching at our school. But thats not all, the team likes to support cancer awerness so the whole team and most of the crowed wore pink socks. So if you see any of the people on the team make sure you give them a pat on the back for being such a good player and repersenting our school.]]>

Todd Whitaker rushed 150 yards in one of our games and boy that is quick. Also we have a very good passr on our team and his name is Jose Garcia. Jose passed the football 30 times and the person catching the football caught it. We also have a very good interceptor on our team. Jamal Jackson interceptied twice in a game and they were good interceptions. The Northwest Wildcats is a very good football team and if you love football and you go to Northwest then try out for our football team and maybe one day you'll be the best interceptor or even maybe the best passer. If you really love football and love to tryout, our Wildcats tryouts are in the Spring so all those football players come and tryout. GO Wildcats!]]>

Our football coach even said this was the best team he's coached ever since he's joined Northside Middle School! All of our players did an amazing job. Jose Garcia scored one touchdown and got a whopping thirty pass completions. Todd Whitaker scored an amazing two touchdowns and rushed 150 yards. Jason Strong also scored two touchdowns and completed one interception. Jamal Jackson also pitched in with his two interceptions. Of course, we can't forget Stacy King with one field goal! With all this and the Northwest Wildcats teamwork, we defeated our rivals, the East Middle School Buckaroos, with a score of 38-35!]]>

The players were really standing out, so were the fans, because they all wore pink for cancer awareness. There were 500 fans there in the stands. The coach was proud of the wildcats for winning, just by two points. Wildcats got 38, and Buckaroos got 35. The coach said that the wildcats was the best team he has had since he started coaching at Northside Middle School. The players all did at least one amazing thing. Jose Garcia made one touchdown and a 30 pass completion. Todd Whitaker made two touchdowns and went 150 yards rushing. Jason Strong got two touchdowns and one interception. Jamal Jackson had two interceptions and last, but not least, Stacy King made one field goal. The coach said he was proud of his players.]]>

My opinion about the football game is that the East Middle School students should have tried harder during the football game. To me I personaly think that the students from The East Middle School did try but as they noticed they were losing they didn`t try as hard.]]>

They may have won by 3 points against the East Middle School Buckaroos but they were awesome that time. For one i am pleased with them wearing pink socks for cancer awareness day. That was very loving and very knid. It was also amazing how there were 500 fans in the stands cheering for the wildcats to win!!! Now that was some spirit for the wildcats. Another thing that caught my eye was that the coach thought that he was coaching the best team since he started to work in Northside Middle School. And i just want to give a shoutout to the ones who got 150 yards rushing and to the one who got 30 pass completions. those two were Todd Whitaker for the 150 yards rushing and Jose Garcia for the 30 pass completions. CONGRATS WILDCATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!]]>

One the defence we have Jamal Jackson who intercepted two throws on his own. With these strong players the couch was especially impressed with our season.

The coach says this is the best team he has coached since he has started at Northwest Wildcats. Jose Garcia played with amazing leadership yesterday, leading the team as the quarterback who made 30 pass completions and one touchdown. Todd Whitaker rushed the ball an amazing 150 yards and scored two touchdowns for the team! Jason Strong not only made two touchdowns, but also intercepted the ball once to give his team another chance. Jamal Jackson did the same, but he did it twice, letting the team score the five touchdowns they had! Stacy King topped it off with an amazing kick that scored the team a field goal to win it all!

Both the players and their fans wore pink socks to represent cancer awareness. &quot;This is the best team I've ever coached since I've started at Northside Middle School,&quot; says the coach of the winning team. He was not wrong in the slightest about that-- Northside had won by a landslide! Congratulations to the Wildcats for beating their rivals, the Buckaroos. Jose Garcia of Wildcats was one of his teams finest players! He managed to get one touchdown and thirty pass completions! Todd Whitaker, another fellow Wildcat, did not lack success either. He got two touchdowns, and one-hundred-and-fifty yards rushing. Jason Strong did well, too, with two touchdowns and one initerception. A shoutout to Jamal Jackson and Stacy King for their interceptions and field goals.]]>

The season ended with a football game last Friday night against the East Middle School Buckaroos. All 500 of their loyal fans couldn't believe all the touchdowns Jose Garcia, Todd Whitaker, and Jason Strong had made. And let's not forget about the one and only, Stacy King, who made an amazing field goal! When these Wildcats defeated their rivals, their proud fans noticed they wore pink socks to support cancer awarness. We could tell Coach Wilson was sad to see them leave, after he admitted it was the best team he had coached since he started working at Northside Middle School.]]>

We even showed some spirit by wearing pink socks for cancer awareness.Overall I think that we had some honorable meantions like Jose Garcia for 30 pass completions and one touch down and Todd Whitaker for 150 yard rushings and two touch downs the rest did great as well!

They managed to beat their rival, and who doesn't feel accomplished defeating someone who we have been trying to beat so many times? We have to thank their amazing team for that win. 3/5 people on the team got at least 1 touchdown, and 2 of them got two touchdowns! That adds up to the whopping 38 points. The 2 kids who didn't score a touchdown, contributed too. Jamal Jackson intercepted the football twice, and Stacy King made 1 field goal. With such an outstanding team, theres no doubt how they won. However, we can't only thank the team for the win. Everyone knows that the home team has a much better chance of winning, and this crowd proves it! Five-Hundred people managed to come to the game and root their favorite team to victory. That's 1,000 hands cheering for the Northwest Wildcats to win. Also, every person in the crowd wore pink socks to show their cancer awareness appreciation. The Northwest Wildcat fans are very caring and motivating.]]>

Todd Whitaker made not 1 but 2 touchdowns, so did Jason Strong I think they both deserve a after party. Then Stacy King the only girl on the football team made 1 field goal. So when you see her today give her a thumbs up! Don't forget about Jose Garcia, you know he did really good at the game last night, even though he didn't make any touchdowns or field goals he still did his best and did 30 pass completions. So, when you see the Wildcats walking in the halls make sure to tell them if they have their hall pass(LOL) just kidding, just make sure to say that they did an amazing job and to meow it up at the next game(LOL). Also, the next time you go to one of their football games make sure you get your team spirt on and buy some t-shirts to support the school and the Wildcats. GO WILDCATS!!]]>

Todd Whitaker had an outstanding game, by rushing for 150 yards. Jose Garcia had a new school record of 30 pass completions in one game. With 2 seconds left on the clock, Stacy kicked the game winning 54 yard field goal. The offnese did outstanding, but what about our defense? Well our defense cause many turnovers, by intercepting the ball 3 times! The 2 players who contributed to those interceptions were, Jason Strong, and Jamal Jackson. The defensive line put the Buckaroos on hold. Now lets get some info from the stands. Almost everyone on the field, and in the stands wore pink for breast cancer awareness. There were 500 fans in the stands, and tey all loved the game. Even Coach says that that was the best game they've ever had.]]>

Not only was it the football skills the team seems to have, pu probably th crowd! About 500 of Northside Middle School students were in the stands, cheering on our players. They were a great support to the team. Not only supportive to the team, but for Cancer Awareness month. Every fan and player had on pink socks; just about, anyway. The final score was 38-35; Wildcats. The Buckaroos are our school's rivals, so it was a huge accomplishment for us to have beaten them. The game consisted of Jose Garcia gaining us 1 touchdown, Todd Whitaker gaining 2, and Jason Strong with another 2. Jason Strong had itercepted the ball once, while Jamal Jackson intercepted twice! Jose Garcia had thrown and completed 30 passes. The game was finished with a field goal by Stacy King. This game was exciting overall. Keep it up, Wildcats, and good job!]]>

It was a very close game, with the final score 38-35. Both Todd Whitaker and Jason Strong scored two touchdowns, and Jose Garcia scored one. Stacy King also had a field goal. At that game, 500 fans were in the stands, and both players and fans wore pink socks to raise cancer awareness. Jason Strong and Jamal Jackson had a total of three interceptions, which were important to the game's outcome. The Wildcats' coach says that this is the best team he's coached since he started at Northside Middle School. No wonder he said that, with Jose Garcia having 30 pass completions and Todd Whitaker rushing 150 yards. Go Wildcats!]]>

We want to say a special thanks to a few of our fantastic players on the Wildcats team. Jose Garcia came in with a fantastic touchdown and an amazing 30 pass completions! He was a key element of the team and it was really great to have him with us. Todd Whitaker came in with an unbelivable two touchdowns, and an outstanding total of 150 yards rushing. Jason Strong was obviously a key element in the team this year. Ranking in with a full 2 touchdowns and an interception, it would have been difficult to play without him. Jamal Jackson put the other teams to shame with his 2 interceptions. And finally, we would like to give a thanks to Stacy King for his fantastic field goal that blew everyone away. Of course, we'd also like to thank the entire team and of course the coach who stated, &quot; This is the best team he's ever coached since he started at Northside MIddle School.

The game was well anticipated by the players and fans at both schools, and the turnup was huge. Over 500 fans showed up in the stands, filling them to the brim, to support their team and hopefully celebrate their victory. In the end, they won, with Todd Whitaker and Jason Strong each scoring 2 touchdowns, Stacy King scoring a field goal, and Jose Garcia completing an amazing number of 30 passes. All of these people were supporting something else as well. Every person who showed up at the game, player and fan alike, wore pink socks for cancer awareness. This cause was also greatly celebrated by everyone after the Wildcats' great victory. The coach says this is the best team he's coached since his career at Northside Middle School began, and he can't wait for next season!]]>

But once we got going with the season, everyone was ready to play! Jose Garcia was able to make one touchdown in our first game, along with Todd Whitaker, who scored two. In the next few games Jason Strong was able to make two more touchdowns, winning that game! The only field goal we managed to make was from Stacy King. The rest of the season ws pretty good to. Footbal isn't all about touchdowns. In our firstfew games, Jason Strong was able to intercept once. Jamal Jackson did so by scoring two interceptions. In the entire season, Todd Whitaker was able to run 150 yards! Jose Garcia was also able to complete 30 passes. Overall, I'd say it was a pretty good season.]]>

Jason Strong had two touchdowns and one interception. Jamal Jackson was a beast on defense and had two interceptions and Stacy King had one far game winning field goal. We beat them thirty-eight to thirty-five and we played great.

The East Middle School Buckaroos had the ball and were going for a pass, but out of nowhere, lightning quick, Jamal Jackson intercepted the ball. What a move that was. So now it was the Wildcats ball again and Jose threw a perfect pass and Todd scored another touchdown, this time the crowd roared! Buckaroos coach called a time out and so the Wildcats talked about their plays. It was the Buckaroos ball so all the Wildcats coach said was, &quot;Intercept that ball and score a TD.&quot; They then yelled &quot;Wildcats&quot; and hurried on the field. The score was 38 to 35, with a time of 1 minute on the clock. The Buckaroos tried everything to break the Wildcats off, but they stayed strong. It was 4th down for them and they didn't have any play, so they did a pass. That right there was a big mistake because out of nowhere again came Jamal with another interception. The Wildcats fans and crowd went crazy, but the game was over and they took home the win.]]>

Jose through the ball to Todd, Todd ran all the way down the feild and passed it to Jason who made the touchdown scoring another touchdown for the Northwest Wildcats! Almost every one at the game wore pink to show and spread awarness for cancer. After the game I questioned the foodball team's coach and he said this was one of his best games since he has been at Northside Middle School. At the end of the game I think it's safe to say that we beat our rivals the East Middle School Buckaroos once and for all!]]>

But I would say, and I do believe that a whole lot of people out there would agree with me on this, out best game yet was last night. We beat out rivals 38-35! Way to go Wildcats! Nice Job to Jose Garica who has 30 pass completions. Todd Whitaker, with two touchdowns and 150 rushing yards. Jason Strong with two touchdowns and one interception. Jamal Jackson with two interceptions. And Stacey King with one field goal! Great job out there guys, keep up the good work. Coach Wilson said it was a great team, a great game, and that he was proud of his players accomplishments. He also stated that this is the best team that he has coached since he started. All of the players and fans wore pink socks to celebrate breast cancer awareness month, and for all the people who were lost to the horrible illness. Stay strong and keep fighting. Last night, there were over 500 fans in the stands! That's a whole new record! Keep it up you guys.]]>

The MVP for this game was Todd Whitaker with 2 touchdowns and an astounding 150 yards rushing. Another valuable player to this game was Jos??

In fact, coach Wilson said that this was one of the best teams he coached since he started coaching at Northside Middle School. Today we went against the East Middle School Buckaroos, there were many great plays in this game, Jose Garcia made 1 touchdown, Todd Whitaker made 2, and Jamal Jackson made 2 touchdowns. We also had 3 interceptions from jason Strong (1 interceptions) and Jamal Jackson (2 interceptions) and 1 feild goal made by Stacy King. Another thing that was great was that we had 500 fans in the stands supporting us that wore pink socks fro cancer awareness month! This really helped the team to work their hardest infront of their peers/fans. The Northside Wildcats defeated the East Middle School Buckaroos, and coach Wilson mentioned that it was a great team effort and that he was proud of his players' accomplishments. The team plans on using team work for all their future games so they can continue to be successful. GO WILDCATS!!]]>

And the kicker, Stacy King, also added some points with a field goal. In the defence Jason Strong had a 1 Iterception and had 2 Touchdown, and Jamal Jackson helped with those two interceptions! This is really the best team since he coached here and he was not lying. With 500 fans and the players and fans wering pink socks they helped the cancer awareness together.

Jose Garcia is an exceptional quarterback which he proved last game with 30 pass completions and one touchdown in their win against their rivals East Middle School Buckaroos. Even though Jose Garcia is a good quarterback he can't win games alone so it's a good thing that the runningback, Todd Whitaker, can run like he did last game because he scored two touchdowns and rushed for 150 yards. Jamal Jackson stepped up big on defense with 2 interceptions and I think these are the kind of performances we can get used to seeing from him. After the game the coach said that this was the best team he has coached since he started at Northside Middle School.]]>

The team only had one field goal by Stacy King. At the big game players and fans wore pink socks for cancer awareness. That means 500 fans in the stands wore pink socks! The Northside Wildcats' coach says they're the best team he has ever coached since he started working at the school. Since the game the teams have been big rivals, but I guess the East Middle Scool Buckaroos know where they stand now!]]>
