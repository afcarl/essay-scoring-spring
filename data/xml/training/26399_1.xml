So 15 minutes later, all the boys on the team came to his house. One of the boys asked Will, what are they doing at his house. Will told them all about his plan. So after Will told them about his plan, some of the boys started to brainstorm some ideas of what they will be doing. One of the boys thought of a great idea of what they could be doing. So 5 minutes later, they were asking Will's mom if they could go to the arcade. Will's mom said,''Yes.'' So the boys went to the arcade and were there for 2 hours. They were all glad that they got to do something.]]>

Once they thought about what they were going to do they decided to build a castle out of blankets and pillows. After Andy hung up Will called his friend Toby and when they talked for about 5 min. Toby agreed to make a castle. The last person he called was his friend James and he also agreed to make a castle. When they all got there they started building the castle. They grabbed every pillow and blanket they could find and started working on the idea.

Finally, the doorbell rang and immediately, Will raced towards the door. He opened the door to see all of his teammates, Jamie, Andy, and Carl. All three boys came in to devise a plan. As they came in, snacks were prepared in case they get a bit hungry. &quot;Hmm, what to do,&quot; Will wondered aloud. &quot;I know! Let's play a game called, Fireball!&quot; Jamie shouted. The rest of the boys look confused at him. Jamie explained that to play the game, you need a ball, be in a circle, and throw the ball at person trying to get them out by trying to get them to miss it. All baseball players nodded in excitement and got ready to play. &quot;This is actually a fun day!&quot; Will shouted while throwing the ball to Andy. All agreed joyfully.]]>

Next, he calls Zack, he actually doesn't have any thing to do so he says he'll meet up with him. After, he calls J.J and he's bored as well, so he meets up too. Then, he calls Donovan, but he's busy watering the garden, and watching his little brother. So, he gets ready for a day with his friends, when Zack, and J.J come they start playing Hide and go Seek in the dark. They all had a great time and ate snacks, but then its time to say Good-Bye. When Zack's dad comes, Zack asks his dad if he can stay for a sleepover. His dad says, &quot;Ok you can stay i'll be here tomorrow morning to pick you up.&quot; Well, that's good for him. Then J.J's parents come and he also asks and he gets to stay over as well. Lastly, Tommy, and Donovan come and the five boys hang together, tell spooky stories, have smore's, and eat breakfast the next morning. Guess, what happened next morning, well the coach called and they had a game on that afternoon. They also win the game because it was 1-3.]]>

Do you mind coming over, I have nothing to do?&quot; He answered back exitedly &quot;Sure!,&quot; Will told his mom that his friend answered and he will be coming over to play games. When they got there they rushed into Will's room and they turned on a baceball video game and played it. Will's mom yelled across they room to tell them, &quot;Hey dont be on there too long!&quot; After a long two hours of playing they finally got off and did something inventive and fun. They desided to make their own ball launcher. His mother thought would be a fun thing to do! They cutted things out, drew on paper, and had many other things to do. It took them about a half an hour, but at last they were done and they thought it was amazing. &quot;Hey!&quot; Will yelled. &quot;Look the rain is gone! We should go out and play for a while, what about a small round of baceball before you leave?&quot; &quot;Ok but it can't be long i have to go soon,&quot; His friend said in a sad voice. Even though they played baceball for a couple of minutes they thought it was the best baceball game in the world!]]>

When the team got there, Will yanked the game ''Candyland'' from his closet. It had some dust on it because he hadn't used it for a while. When they were done setting up the game, Will asked his mother if she would pop some popcorn. When it was done cooking, it felt like he was at a game. The boys on his team sitting right next to him, the buttery and salty aroma of popcorn trailing up his nose, a fun game right in front of him. He was happy and enjoying his time inside. After all, life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain.]]>

When he got to the kitchen he glanced out the window at the familiar green field that spread out underneath his window. Will's hand found the little notch where the phone was always put. He sighed as his fingers found the number he had dialed time after time. Again Will looked out the window,this time a little less mournfully so. Suddenly, an idea hit him hard. Why hadn't he thought of it before? When Will's friends answered the phone, they all agreed to his idea. They drove up to his driveway in galoshes, raincoats, hats, and carring umbrellas. They stomped into his yard, laughing and talking. Will met them out in his backyard and then they began to stomp in puddles, throw mudballs at each other, and remember how it was to be a little kid again. When Will glanced up very quickly midst a mudball fight, he saw his mother with a cup of steamy hot chocolate, smiling as she watched the fight. When she saw Will looking at her, she smiled even wider and waved. Will gave his mom a big thumbs-up, right as a wet slimy mudball smashed into his face. He laughed along with everyone else, promising whoever threw that mudball would be sorry, all the while still laughing.This still really is the best day of the week! Will thought]]>

Billy who had been wishing it would stop raining too said, &quot;Yeah this storm is really bumming me out!&quot; Then Will called his friend Henry, &quot;So me and Billy are hanging out at my place want to join?&quot; Asked Will. &quot;Yeah not only, we can't play the game but, my mom won't let me play in the house!&quot; Replied Henry.Next, he called Steve and Paul, who were twins, &quot;Do you guys want to hang out at my place?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot; Replied Paul. Finally, he invited Jimmy over, &quot;Do you want to hang out with the team at my place?&quot; Asked Will. &quot;Yeah my little siblings are pulling me limb from limb and how am I supposed to play baseball with a bunch of jumbled up limbs?&quot; When they all arrived they moved everything out of the living room and got plates,gloves,and a bat.Then were starting to play when Will's younger sister and her four friends walked into the room, and asked if they could join. Will was 12 and his little sister wasn't that little, she was 7 1\2. Will looked at his friends and laughed, &quot;You guys can't play your 7 year old girls, go along and play with your dolls!&quot; Mary, Will's younger sister yelled &quot;WE ARE 7 AND 1\2! WE WANT TO PLAY WHY DON&quot;T YOU STEP A SIDE AND PLAY WITH YOUR DOLLIES!&quot; Will replied with tenseness in his voice, &quot;We play with action figures, there is a diffrence! And if you think you are so good why don't we play and who ever wins has to act as slaves to the winning team or should I say us!&quot; All of Mary's friends yelled &quot;DEAL! And if we win you have to adimt that girls are better than boys!&quot; The boys said, &quot;Sure like your going to win!&quot; They played and the girls won! They had them write girls are way better than boys 100 times. Some girls older brothers had lost and they had to rub their feet get them juice boxes and everything! When Mary and her friends grew up they were in their own little baseball team!]]>

Once all of his friends were there, they tried thinking of ideas on what to do while it was raining. They thought of playing baseball in Will's living room, but that didn't turn out very well. &quot; Strike one! &quot;yelled one of Will's friends. &quot;Strike two!&quot; he yelled again. On the last throw,the boy ended up breaking a lamp in the living room of the house.&quot;Run!&quot; said Will, &quot;Just leave the lamp!&quot;. They thought of other possible things that they can do.The best thing that they could think of is watching out the window to see if the rain will stop.Will's mom thought of an idea for them. &quot;Who wants to watch a movie,&quot; said Will's mom. The mom got the movie all ready for them to watch. Of course, the movie was about baseball because the boys love to play it. &quot; I feel liike we're in an actual movie theater,&quot; said one of the boys. &quot;This rainy day turned out not as bad as I thought it would!&quot; said Will. As the movie ended, the boys started to feel tired. All of the boys looked out the window and noticed it stopped raining and the sun was out. The boys all ran outside and played baseball together!]]>

At first they played some board games but didn't really like them much. Then one of his friends said thet should play rain tag. He told them that rain tag is just tag in the rain, so not much different. So Will asked his mom if he and his friends can play outside. Will's mom said they had to wear raincoats. So when they got their raincoats they went outside and played. They had so much fun thay played until they got tired. They all went inside and had some food and drinks. WIll asked his mom if his friends could stay over and have some dinner. So is mom made some calls and asked all of his friends moms. All of his friends could stay over only after dinner. So Will and his friends went outside and played some more rain tag. They played some more until the rain stoped. The boys were so happy, they got their bats and gloves and played baseball outside instead of playing rain tag. Will's mom called Will and his friends inside to eat. All the boys ate and then when they were done the went back outside and played some more baseball. It was getting dark so all of his friends had to go home. Will told his mom that the had the best day of his week. His mom said to him &quot; Well I'm glad you had fun.&quot;]]>

The three boys were confused and desperate for ideas for games to play. They sat in the middle of Will's room, thinking about what to play. Their eyes were focused on the ground. They looked dead, but they were just thinking hard. Will's eyes lit brighter than a lightbulb all of a sudden, &quot;I know what we should do! We should build a fort made out of blankets!&quot; Will exclaimed. &quot;Thats a great idea, Will!&quot; Nemo supported the idea. The three boys found eight colorful blankets and tall, wooden sticks to keep the fort standing. They placed the blankets everywhere and tied them at every corner possible. The fort was finished in no time with the help of all three boys. They stared at the masterpiece they had made. Will's mom walked in with some refreshments and snacks after they finsihed. &quot;Wow!&quot; Will's mom exclaimed, &quot;I have never seen anything like this before!&quot; She then joined in and partied with them.]]>

He called his friend Jack first. He said,&quot; Hey do you want to go to the Community Center and play baseball in there.&quot; Jack replied, &quot; I would love too.&quot; Then he called Andrew. He said,&quot; I asked Jack if he would like to play baseball at the Community Center and he said yes. Do you want to come too?&quot; Andrew said to him,&quot; Sure, we will have lots of fun.&quot; So, Will asked his mom if she could drive him to the Community Center. She said that she would. When they got there they saw Jack and Andrew. They all took out their bats, gloves, and baseballs. Andrew pitched to Will. Will swung and hit it deep in the inside court. He ran and ran untill he scored a home run. Next, Will pitched to Jack. Will striked him out and Andrew was up. He hit it deep as well. But Will caught it and he was out. As they went out the building, they all said good game to eachother. Also, they said see yah at school.]]>

In half an hour Will was still stumped, sitting in his room still staring out the window. Then in another half an hour the doorbell rang for the first time.

The phone rang loudly in his ear. &quot;Hello?&quot; Ryan answered sounding dissapointed and dreary. &quot;Hey dude, you should come over to my place. We can chilll and play video game. &quot; Dude, we should also like totally watch the Giants and the Rangers!&quot; &quot;How about 12:00 to 8:00; dinner is on me!&quot; Will said basically jumping up and down. &quot;Sounds good bro, see ya soon!&quot; Will had basically that same conversation with the rest rest of the boys and it turned out, all the boys were as anxious as Will was. &quot;Thanks mom!&quot; Will said. He silently thought I don't know what I'd do without her. The next ten minutes seemed like years to Will as he stood behind his dooor on the front porch and awaited the arrival of his baseball buddies. By the time the boys were all there Will's mom had cooked up some popcorn, burgers, and a heaping bowl of candy. Will and his buddies laughed and had lots of fun whether it was watching the nail biting game or playing Zombie Attack ,I crave 4 brains. The night quickly passed by and the hours they'd spent together felt like only ten minutes. &quot;This rainy Saturday really wasn't that bad at all, not only because the Giants won. Thanks for helping me mom!&quot; Will said. He gave his mom a big hug and small kiss. With that Will put on his pajamas, brushed his teeth, and went to bed grinning ear to ear.]]>

They played many fun games in the house and forgot about the baseball game and the rain that was falling down. Will offerd his friends to sleepover and they all agreed to stay over. That afternoon the rain stoped when the baseball game was supposed to end. Even though they were all dissapointed that they wouldn't be able to play their game, they all went outside and played their own game and it felt like they were on the field!]]>

Right?&quot; 'Yeah!!&quot; they replied. &quot; Well, maybe my mom can give us a ride down there! i am sure we will all be alot happier and less grumpy.&quot; &quot;Great Idea!&quot; 'Mom, can you give us a ride down to the indoor fields&quot; &quot;Sure!&quot; So they all hopped in the car and talked all about baseball on their way there.

We all love baseball right?&quot; They nodded.&quot;Plus, game day is even better! So I thought we could do something! My plan is we can still play baseball, but not outside! We can play at the indoor sports center down the street! I called them and they are free! So if we car pool, maybe using help from our parents we can get the game back on!&quot; &quot;YEAH!&quot; They all yelled. Logan called coach to tell him the idea and he loved it! Will called everyones parents to car pool and they were there in five minutes! &quot;We did it guys, great job&quot; &quot;We couldn't of done it without you Will&quot;, said Logan.

He bent his knees, had the bat in his hands, and as it was coming towards him he hit the ball with all his might and hit a homerun! He happily ran down the bases and later that evening Will's team had won the game! Everyone on there team was excited as they were packing up.]]>

of them in a group chat.Duncan said out loud &quot;Im soooo bored!&quot;Me to I've been waiting all week for the game and just because the stupid rain i gotta wait all&quot; over again Tom said.All the others agreed with him.What about a sleepover at your house Duncan Will suggested.Sure what time do you guys wanna come over?7:00.Sure Billy said See you guys there.And they all disconnected.Everyone of the boys asked there mom if they could go they all approved.*Everyone is at Duncans house.Hey guys!Duncan exclaimed.Hi Duncan they all said simauentaneously(Same time at same speed)Wanna go in my Room or watch TV downstairs?Hmmm....They thought about it for about 1 minute.Lets go in your room.Duncan grinned&quot;Good choice Tom,Billy,and Will were amazed by the content in Duncans room.Posters of Famous Baseball Player signed officially by the superstars.He had a computer Ipod ,Iphone An Xbox 1,Wii,Gamecube,PS4,And A PSVITA.Will murmured I need to start coming over your house more often.They all burst out laughing.So what do you wanna play first.What kind of videob games do you have?No no Will i mean which console.?Oh will said what about the Xbox 1?Sure.What games do you have for it Billy said.Um let me see Duncan said ......I have Call of Duty Black Ops:2 Halo 4,And Sonic Allstar Racing transformed.Lets start with Call Of Duty Black Ops:2They played each game for at least 3 hours each.Luckily for them it was Friday which ment they would not get in trouble if they woke up extra late.They woke up about 12:00 midday on Saturday evening.Well I guess its time to go home see you later Duncan.Wait up guys I just gotta voicemail From the coach that the Baseball match is not going to be rescheduled for next week buts its actually going to be on today!What time!!!?They all asked.Um...1:00 Thats an hour from now I havent even brushed my teeth or eat my breakfast.Aww Maan I got a solution lets Bring A PBJ with us so that we can eat while the games going on.Wont that give us bad breath not if we bring mints.But...but...but The coach says that if your body is in motion after you eat your stomach will not digest the food good enough and you can choke/throwup.I dont care do you want to lose the championship or not.NOT they all said.Okay i just made a blueprint of how the plan will work after each hour of the game we will eat 1/4 of ours sandwhiches since every break 15 minutes that will give our stomachs enough time to digest the food into energy.Alright.We put on our clothes brushed our teeth combed our hair and made the sanwhiches it was time to put this plan into action.Lucky for them the Stadium had a 10 minute delay becasue they had to wash off dirt that had fallen onto the seats.Lets eat 1/8 of our sandwhich so because when you divide the time and fractions that should allow us to digest our food good enough.They cut small pieces of sandwhices of to eat.Unfortunately the coaches found out that they were eating the PBJS in the middle of a game.And he said it is not allowed to eat anything that has more than 100 calories for it would giver that teams players a energy advantage over the other.And they were banned from Baseball practice for about 3 days.Now Tom,Will,Duncan,And Billy were The MVPS of there team so without them the team could'nt win because each player could only scoare about 2 points before they were struck out those three could earn 10.In the game our opponent scraped us very harshly.***This is all your fault Will said when he came back to Duncans house that sunday.They all started to argue and blame and say mean things to each other.As it went on There freindship as a group disenegrated little by little.Until Dunca finally said maybe we shouldnt be freinds anymore.Will said &quot;Finally something we can agree on&quot;.As the anger and tension boiled in that room.Duncan punched Will in the stomach Billy chanted a battle cry.And then the rumble began............Everyone turned on each other instantly.It was madness.Duncans Mom came up into the room and screamed in A high raspy voice what is going on in here!Tom replied nothing were just having a little playfight Tom grinned.Thats alright but dont play in each so rough.Actually all of your mom are here nd there ready to pick you 3 up see you another time.Yeah See you guys another time.Billy murmured to himself im going to hit him in baseball practice.Now even though they were seperated they still wanted a good laugh.It was Duncans turn to hit and Billys turn to pitch everyone had made them go first in order to see this.Billy drew his handback.Builded up strength and threw.Duncan was expectinng that Billy was going to do this but what he didnt see was that the ball didnt come directly come towards him he was prepared for that with his bat in front of him.It instead did a corkscrew and curved at A Acute angle(A bent angle usually 30 degress or less).It hit him straight in his mouth.His mouth was bleeding red gushy water out and his blood grew hot.everyone laughed at him everyone was calling him A clown with red water from his face and a red face it was like he was a freakshow.Billy said Oops sorry about that just kidding.!Now Duncans anger grew so hot that it seemed as if he was 1 trillion degrees.He charged at Billy with destructive force and it landed him on the ground and he started to punch him in his chest furiously.]]>

Jimmy replied wit a sigh and told Will that this was the most boring Saturday ever. He thought the game was probably canceled too.

After maybe an hour Will had the whole team at his house. Will's mom made pizza for lunch. After lunch they played a card game in Will's room. Then Will's mom told them that she just baked brownies and she had some ice cream too. The team huried out of the room and into the kitchen. It turned out to be a not so boring Saturday after all.]]>

I bet you're disappointed about the weather too, right?&quot; &quot;Yeah, but I have a plan that will turn this day of boredom into a day of fun!&quot; replied Will, and told Matthew his plan. &quot;That's a great idea! I'll call Devin and R.J., and you call Ryan and Aiden,&quot; said Matthew. &quot;Then, you get to work preparing your house, and I'll come over with the games and DVD's.&quot;Quickly, they both got to work. After calling his two friends, Will started working on the decorations. He turned his family room into a movie theatre. He turned his bedroom into a game room. He also made popcorn and poured soda. At 10:30 AM, Matthew came over with the discs. soon, at 11:00, Ryan, Aiden, R.J., and Devin showed up. &quot;We are going to have a Lord of the Rings marathon!&quot; exclaimed Will. &quot;Cool!&quot; everyone else said. The plan was to watch all three Lord of the Rings movies, then play Lord of the Rings video games, and have a Lord of the Rings themed sleepover. It turned out to be a lot of fun, and none of them even remembered that they were supposed to be disappointed about the game.]]>

Will called half of the team and Mark called the other half. The party was to be at 11:00 a.m. After Will got of the phone, he ran strait downstairs to clean the house and get ready. Soon his guests started to arrive. He was so glad the whole team could make it. He looked around the room and saw everybody but one person, Mark. &quot;Where could he be?&quot; thought Will. Sure enough, Mark finnally arrived. He was late because he had to finish cleaning his room. Now EVERYBODY on the team was there. Will said happily,&quot;It isn't a boring saturday after all!&quot;]]>

After a quick lunch of Peanut Butter and Jelly, he picked the phone and called all his friends from the team. He said, &quot;Meet me at my house as soon as you can.&quot; Slowly, they all came. &quot;I was thinking of doing something,&quot; Will exclaimed. &quot;We could go to the gym near my house to practice and get even better!&quot; One of them, John the pitcher, said &quot;That's a great idea! But I have these stupid banjo lessons at one fifteen, so we only have an hour fifteen minutes.&quot; David, the catcher, laughed nervously. &quot;You take banjo lessons?&quot; John's face turned bright red. &quot;Anyway, we should get going before one.&quot; When they got there, the other team was there, too. No! Will thought. Not you guys! It's just supposed to be us! Eventually, the other team noticed them. The leader, Jackson, stepped forward. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; he asked. Will said, &quot;Same as you. Too practice so we can get better and mop the floor with you.&quot; This kept going, and finally, they had a pregame in the gym. Unfortunetly, John had to go. It was close, but the other team won. They started bragging they would win this game. Will's team got out of the gym and went back to the house. They had ice cream, and said, &quot;Why win when your mom makes good homemade ice cream?&quot; They had lost the pregame, but Will was happy. The rest of the team, too.

The phone rang and rang and finally somebody answered. &quot;Hello?&quot; asked Will's friend Larry. &quot;Hey Larry, It's really raining hard outside.&quot; Will said. &quot;Yeah really hard.&quot; explained Larry. Will could hear the rain hitting Larry's roof in the backround of the phone. &quot;Don't you think we need to stop the rain for our game?&quot; asked Will. &quot;Yes! Why don't you check the weather report?&quot; said Larry. &quot;Okay! Bye!&quot; said Will. &quot;See you later!&quot; said Larry. Will hung up the phone and ran to check the weather report on the TV. He turned on channel 5 and the weatherman said, &quot;Heavy rain but it looks like by Saturday there will be no rain just sun. Enjoy your weekend, back to you Bob,&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot; cried Will. By Saturday, Will was ready to play baseball. He made 2 homeruns. They won the championship game and Will had alot of fun. The End]]>

Only two of them could come, but at least he could still ave people over. After his friends, Kaden and Scott arrived, Will and his mother had already set the table with chips, fruit snacks, candy etc. They mostly played video games and board games, but his mother let them run around for a small amount of time, just to get their energy out. A few hours later the three boys had had enough fun for one day. Kaden and Scott got ready to go while Will cleaned up the messes that they had made. After Will's friends left, Will said excitedly to his mother &quot; That was the best day ever!&quot;]]>

While he waited for the boy to pick up, he couldn't help but feel excited, he hadn't had anyone one over in awhile! When the boy picked up he felt even more excited, he said yes! And the good news just kept coming, all of them said yes! When all the boys arrived they played for hours, played video games, had a nerf gun war, and watched an action movie. Once all of the boys finally went home Will sat on his bed and thought about how good of a day he had had. Right then his Mom came into the room. &quot; Now, what did I tell you?&quot; She smiled. &quot; Had a good time didn't you?&quot; &quot; I guess your right Mom, and thanks for suggesting it.
