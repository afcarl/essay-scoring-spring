At the beginning of the story, Saburo describes himself joining the track and field team; however, his father wasn't too excited to hear that he had only joined to run one part, the 800 meter. Thier relationship at this point is exemplified when he and his father are about to go and practice, &quot;[I] wished [my] father were like [my] friends' fathers: sun-browned, guffawing men who ruffled children's hair with affectionate ease.&quot; This shows that his experiences with his dad are not too thoughful and easy to remember. At this point, thier relationship isn't at its greatest possilbilty, but when he decides to quit the track and field team and mainly focus on college and education, their relationship gets to a new level. As he grows older and is focused more oneducation, their relationship improves becasue they have a new found passion that both of them enjoy. The whole time, their relationship needed a focus on something they both would enjoy, not just one, which is why they bonded better when they could talk about science, &quot;...thier conversations were no longer awkward. Any conversational opening inevitably led to a lecture on astronomy.&quot;]]>

Saburo states that &quot;their conversations were no longer awkward&quot; when he is thirty years old, which implies that as a child he was very awkward and distant with his father. Saburo's father was different from his friend's fathers. During one scene Saburo states, &quot;He wished his father were like his friends' fathers: sun-browned, guffawing men who ruffled children's hair with affectionate ease.&quot; It is seen that Saburo's father is somewhat cold and strict. He does not show his affection so avidly. However, as Saburo is grown up he realizes that his father has his own unique side of showing his love and affection.]]>

His father is more interested in Saburo's ability to succeed and be the best. His father does not worry about loving and encouraging his son. Instead he is more interested in improving his son. For example, his father questions why is only running one race rather than applauding him for joining track. Also his father never shows up at his track meets which shows his lack of connection with his son. There is also awkwardness when they are together and often silence. His father only watches him run to help him improve his times. His father puts a lot of pressure on Saburo which increases their emotional distance from each other, and ultimately ends Saburo's track and field career because he does not like the amount of pressure and how hard the sport had become for him with his father.]]>

At one point he even states, &quot;he wished his father were like his friends' fathers: sun-browned, guffawing men who ruffled childrens hair with affectionate ease.&quot; Also, the lack of complex dialougue between the two demonstrates how shallow the relationship was. They only spoke in plain sentences, that were beyond superficial, not revealing any hints of concern for the emotional state of either of them. Saburo held great respect for his father, but their relationship was very limited.]]>

He was more of a tough dad, than of an affectionate dad because &quot;Saburo's father belonged to that generation which, having survived the war, rebuilt Japan from ashes, distilling defeat and loss into a single-minded focus with which they erected cities and industries and personal lives&quot;. This made him more of a stern man, than a touchy father. However, as time passed and Saburo grew older, their relationship did strengthen. We see in the last paragraph that no longer are their conversations awkward. They are now filled with passion and this allowed for Saburo to see a side of his dad that he would've never seen before.]]>

The love Saburo's father holds for him is emphasized in his inquiries after Saburo's results at dinner, and his &quot;interest in his son's times&quot; rather than &quot;in his rankings&quot;. Saburo's father clearly loves him and cares more about Saburo's results as an expression of this love, instead of comparing him to the other runners. However, there is also a slight strain in their relationship during Saburo's adolescence, as exemplified by Saburo's wihs that &quot;his father were like his friends' fater: sun-browned, guffawing men who ruffled children's hair with affectionate ease.&quot; Saburo clearly dreams of a more openly emotional and affectionate father while he is in high school, which is perhaps the only point of contention in his relationship with his father, but he later overcomes even this, when, as an adult, &quot;their conversations [are] no longer awkward.&quot;]]>

Saburo wishes that his father was more involved with what occurs in modern times, wishes he was younger so he could understand him more, and wishes he wasn't so stuck in his old ways as the world gradually carried on without him.&quot;The streetcar rattled on until there was no more open-air market, only an asphalt road slicing through kilometer of rice paddies. Only here, with silence stretching over the open fields like an extension of his father, did Saburo feel complete harmony between them.&quot; That quote from the story describes how Saburo reacts to being out of the city. Once Saburo is out of the bubble of youth and current events that cities are in, he begins to understand his father more and feels that there is a really nice connections with him when there isn't so much separating their mindsets. As Saburo grows older, the story mentions how he and his father can have more conversations with ease and this is simply because once a mindset matures, one can understand things that would have never crossed one's mind before. Saburo ends up understanding his father.]]>

In the conversations seen in the text, the father only seems to ask questions, give orders, and supply Saburo with gestures of approval. This makes the dialogue very awkard and choppy unlike normal conversations between close individuals. The final paragraph supports this when it discusses Saburo's relationship as an adult. He contrasts by saying their conversations &quot;were no longer awkward&quot; to use his phrasing. He also discusses the deep conversations about academic topics such as astronomy which foster thought and comprehension, unlike the previous talks between the two individuals.]]>

The war is now over, and people can begin to relax. When Subaro found an activity that interested him, his father took a great amount of time and effort to make sure that his son was doing well. He never really cared about the ranking, but more of whether Suburo was self-improving and enjoying the sport. This could be a way in which Subaro's father relives his childhood through Subaro.

In the first paragraph there are references to what seems to be World War II and it seems like Saburo is speaking out of admiration. Saburo's father seems to be somewhat interested in his sons life seeing how one passage states, ??he always inquired after the results at dinner,??. Although it is also said that Saburo's father does not attend the track copetitions. I do believe that Saburo would like to have a closer relationship with his dad due to the face that he stated, ??He wished his father were like his friends' fathers: sunbrowned, guffawing men who ruffled children's hair with affectionate ease.]]>

When Saburo was in high school, the two had very little common ground or passions. They were both forced to move out of their comfort zones and connect on something that was new and different for both of them: track. This crucial bonding exercise allowed for important teaching moments between the father and son, as well as providing a basis to develop a deeper relationship and a mutual understanding. For instance, when the passage starts off, Saburo says that he had been &quot;too young to remember what his father had been like in peacetime&quot; (Waters). The activity enabled the father to son relationship to strengthen and develop further. It began as &quot;awkward and silent,&quot; but began to transition into a beautiful and healthy relationship. As Saburo began to mature and grow, he came to understand and share some of his father's differences and unique passions. The activity of running at the track served as a basis to build upon a once tenative and budding relationship into one that had &quot;compelete harmony&quot; and &quot;a passionate side&quot; (Waters).]]>

He often encourages Saburo to improve his time by focusing on himself, not those who he is racing. Although he never attends his meets, Saburo's father continues to support his goal by assisting him in practicing and is always curious about how he did that day at the meet. But, Saburo yearns for a more casual and closer relationship with his father while he is a teenager in that, &quot;He wished his father were like his friends' fathers: sun-browned, guffawing men who ruffled children's hair with affectionate ease&quot;. Saburo is jealous of his peers' relationships with their dads because there was never awkward tension, silence, and they show their love in different ways than him and his own father.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Saburo's relationship with his father is quite detached, initially. When Saburo introduces the fact that he is going to run eight hundred meters, a short-distance event, his father merely answers with &quot;eight hundred meters? Is that all?&quot;. However, his father expresses recognition towards Saburo's goals when he states &quot;'I'll be taking you out to Kaigane Station to clock your runs&quot;. The first time his father displays interest and a willingness to assist in Saburo's sport, sparks appreciation in Saburo, however, he questions it as his father is &quot;old&quot; and &quot;an academic&quot;. Although their rides to the station are &quot;awkward and silent&quot;, it is not until they reach their destination where Saburo feels &quot;complete harmony between them&quot;. Saburo and his father's diversities are woven into one when they finally discover a mutality to bond over. Combined with the efforts of both father and son, they become able-bodied in establishing a comforting peace and calming nature between the two of them. When Saburo grows older and is introduced to the land of academics, he finds their conversations are &quot;no longer awkward&quot;, and he learns to appreciate his father's perspective and the diverse aspects to him he had never known. The mutual efforts on behalf of the two of them to not only understand one another, but to actively involve themselves in one another's passions, grants access to the healthy and wholesome relationship that truly emerges in Saburo's later life.]]>
