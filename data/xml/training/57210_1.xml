However, because of the popularity and trust people put into this site many of those 3.86 mistakes are taken to be fact. Some of these &quot;fake facts&quot; make it to the public, even in the local news.(Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote).]]>

Source #4 is all about an Irish student posting a false quote on Maurice Jarre's Wikipedia page. In the second paragraph the writer says, &quot;...flew straight on to dozens of U.S blogs and newspaper Web sites in Britain, Australia and India.&quot; That shows, even professional researches believed that it was a real quote. So, ordinary people would definatley believe it because they don't know either way. In source #2 Dan Fletcher says, &quot;...the English-language version of the controversial user-generated encylopedia...&quot; Wikipedia isn't written by experts, it is written by regular people. So, if you didn't like some one and wanted to write something negative and biased, you could do that. That is why false information is spread quickly on the site.]]>

In source #4, Shane Fitzgerald, an Irish student from Dublin University, conducted a test to see how fast blogs and entries were spread. He conducted his research by posting a poetic, but false, quote on Wikipedia. The qoute was supposably by Maurice Jarre and was posted on the French composer's page hours after his death on March 28. This quote flew straight into dozens of U.S. blogs and newspaper Web sites in Britain, Australia and India. Administrators at wikipedia quickly caught the quote's lack of attribution and removed it from the site. A full month went by and nobody nodiced that the editorial was false. Because of the test results, Fitzgerald was one hundred percent convinced that if he hadn't come foward, the false quote would have gone down in history as something Maurice Jarre said, instead of something he made up. Source #5 also demonstrates that misinformation posted on Wikipedia can spread quickly. In Middlebury College, Vermont, half a dozen students in Neil Waters' Japanese history class asserted on exams that the Jesuits supported the Shimaba Rebellion in 17th-Century Japan. Waters knew something was wrong. According to his knowledge the Jesuits were in &quot;no position to aid a revolution, the few of them in Japan were hiding.&quot; Where was this misleading information comming from? Waters and other professors in the history department had begun noticing that about a year ago, students were citing wikipedia as a source in their papers. More misinformation spread and certain errors showed up on last semesters test. Those errors came from the information of wikipedia. Both these sources show how fast and easily misleading information can spread.]]>

In source #2 it states that Wikipedia is created by users and not by traditional experts, this causes the entries to have simple mistakes that can confuse a reader and have them misunderstand the writers entry. In source #4 the story of a boy, by the name Fitzgerald, is told. It says that he, &quot;posted a poetic but phony quote on Wikipedia to test how our globalized, increasingly Internet- dependent media was upholding accuracy and accountability in our age of instant news.&quot; This phony quote was used in blogs and newspapers at the start and finish of their obituaries.

The reason why someone may put false information is because maybe they didn't double check it (source #4).

Another example why misinformation on Wikipedia can spread quickly is due to the journalists. Journalists are only meant to spread information on things they see and they happened to spread the phony quote all around the world.

This may happen because as shown in Source #4, someone may accidentally or intentionally publish false information onto the website. Though the editors of Wikipedia caught the mistake rather quickly in the circumstances that Source #4 was subjected to, it was not before it was printed for mass media consumption. Though a mea culpa was written and the mayhem was straightened out, had the student not come forward and confessed, many would have taken the false quote as truth. In a different case, things may not play out in the same way and mass media may publish the information as fact for longer periods of time. According to Source #3, Wikipedia is edited by anyone; therefore, is easily changed by people that are not professional. It is indeeed created by users, and must therefore be taken with skepticism, as a user can post a hoax that many others around the world can take as fact.]]>

This fake quote began circulating through newspapers and blogs like wildfire. Similarly, the Japanese history students in Vermont were all in fault of using the bad information they found on wikipedia while taking their exam, and it was evident throughout the class that none of them had caught the mistake and that they had all just assumed it to be true.

Source #5 is an article that placed its focus on a University professor and his outrage towards Wikipedia as well as his students for acquiring incorrect information while studying for their exams. Both sources, and their examples of misinformation spreading quickly can be explained by the idea of humans being inherently lazy creatures. In both cases, obituarist and students, rather than using an encyclopedia correctly and as a springboard for research utilize it as the research information. They chose not to check the sources of the information and actually engage in research. That is the reason why incorrect information on Wikipedia is spread quickly because numerous people choose to be lazy, and take the information for face value rather than using the encyclopedia correctly and utilize it as a springboard for &quot;research&quot;.]]>

For example, Source 2 describes how, even when it first began to indulge in its promising prominence, Wikipedia had to face a serious problem- vandalism. Many people are able to edit any page they want on Wikipedia but the &quot;user-generated encyclopedia&quot; has not changed its settings from allowing anybody to modify pages to allowing only a certain group of people who can be depended on providing accurate information; this allows the spread of misinformation to increasingly grow. Even if the creator of this online encyclopedia decides to ban the freedom of adding information onto its pages whenever someone chooses to do so, most of the information that people will get, in order to undeniably modify the Wikipedia pages that have been plagued by the vandalism of misinformation, are from the internet, where the infinite sources that claim to be truthful are all but just exaggerated stories or lies. In addition, Source 4 explains how one Irish student managed to fool whole nations all over the world. By posting a made up quote on Wikipedia, much less the internet, it was only a matter of time until people from different parts of the world were bound to see it. With the incredibly fast way technology works today, anything that is posted on the internet can be transmitted in seconds. These demonstrations of adding misinformation that is irrelevant to a topic or article on an international website can spread quickly like wildfire on a dry, humid day.]]>

In Source 4, Shane Fitzgerald conducted an experiment to see how &quot;media was upholding accuracy&quot;. It is seen that journalists had quickly taken the quote to use for information without first making sure that it was reliable. This misinformation was spread quickly because journalists, those who are supposed to check for reliable information and give it to the public, did not do their job properly. In Source 5, high school students were shown to have relied heavily on Wikipedia as a citable source of information, and since teachers had let them use such information before, students kept on using unreliable information in their work. Thus, Wikipedia's large database of information appealed to students and gained popularity among them. This misinformation was spread due to lack of care by both teachers and students alike. Therefore, misinformation on Wikipedia is spread quickly due to lack of attention and care by both amateurs, teachers, and experts alike.]]>

The text states, &quot; The moral of this story is not that journalists should avoid wikipedia, but that they shouldnt use information they fine there if it cant be traced back to a reliable primary source.&quot; all throughout out high school we are taught the importance of primary sources and secondary sources and as we can see here the idea has been forgotten as even news publishing comapanies overlook such a rule. Along with globally spreading misinformation from various newspapers and articles, Wikipedia proved to be a site for irritation by a college professor after most of his kids asserted a false claim on his exam. Neil Waters sates, &quot;The obscure, though incorrect, information was from wikipedia, the collaborative online encyclopedia, ant the studenta had picked it up cramming for his exam.&quot; The students were misinformed of a historical fact because they falsely believed that a website claiming to be an online global encyclopedia would increase their chances of doing better on an exam. These two instances whether they be globally or in a certain classroom illustrate how many people can belive something as long as they are visually seeing it as &quot;fact&quot; this goes on to show the rapid spread of misinformation.]]>

By posting false information, the student conducted a test to see &quot;how our globalized, increasingly Internet-dependent media was upholding accuracy and accountability in an age of instant news.&quot; The made-up quote ended up going onto dozens of U.S. blogs and even newspaper Web sites, which further illustrates the point of how many people are dependent onto Wikipedia to provide a vast array of information whenever they need it. Becuase of the dependence on online sources such as Wikipedia and the overall laziness of the majority of people, misinformation posted on Wikipedia can spread quickly.]]>

Soon after there were newspapers, and onlie media that reported on Fitzgerald's quote as if Jarre had actually said it. Although, Fitzgerald's quote was removed from Wikipedia soon after he had put it online, it was not soon enough. This is one way mis information on Wikipedia can spread quickly. Another example of this issue can be found in source five, when it was discovered that the incorrect information found on college student's papers was taken from Wikipedia. This illustrates how many college students use Wikipedia as part of their education, but if what they are reading is wrong then incorrect information is being spread quickyly.

Studies have shown that Wikipedia publishers tend to post articles based on their biased oppinions, which in retro-spect, isn't the type of information people want to be reading (source 2). Also, false information may be put on wikipedia and it can be months before it is realized and taken off. Shane Fitzgerald, a Dublin university student found this out when he decided to test his theory of false information and posted a quote that was stated to have been said by the now deceased musician, Jarre. Fitzgerald states that he is &quot;100-percent convinced that if [he] hadn't come forward, that the quote would have gone down in history as somthing Maurice Jarre said, instead of somthing [he] made up.&quot; (source 4). This false information that was stated on Wikipedia was found to have been quoted multiple times on blogs and newspaper sites in Britain, Australia, and even India. THis quick study by Shane Fitzgerald proves that not all the information published onto Wikipedia is accurate or true and that people tend to believe anything they read on the internet site.]]>

Many teachers and people urge not to use Wikipedia as source of information for an assignment, it ia not a well trusted website cause of all the misinformation some of the writers submit to the page. For instance, source 5 conveys information about a Japanese history class where it states, &quot;The obscure, though incorrect, information was from Wikipedia.&quot; Thereby, the professor strongly incouraged High Schools to not accept Wikipedia as a reference. Another example, is source 4 where an Irish student hoaxes the media with a fake qoute. He says, &quot;I am 100 -percent convinced that if I hadn't come forward, that qoute would have gone down in history as something Maurice Jarre said.&quot; Thereby there might be other qoutes or information that is wrong and that the writer has not comeed forward and convinced.]]>

This is shown in Source #4. &quot;When Dublin university student Shane Fitzgerald posted a poetic but phony quote on Wikipedia, he said he was testing how our globalized, increasingly Internet-depndent media was upholding accuracy and accountability in an age of instant news&quot;. (Source #4). Due to our rumor-craved society we lived in, there are people out there who live for attention craving. This includes misleading many users with fake ideas such as fake quotes. In Source #4, Shane Fitzgerlad proved that many of even well-known journalist will put out stories mostly from Wikipedia sources, without looking at realibilty. &quot;The moral of this story is not that journalist should avoid Wikipedia, but that they shouldn't use information they find there if it can't be traced back to a reliable primary source&quot;. Due to the florid society we live in that is heavily impacted on social media, misinformation on Wikipedia increases. Another reason for misinformation on Wikipedia sources would be the overall flaws of Wikipedia. In Source #1, A brief History of Wikipedia, it's proven that &quot;the biggest issue dogging Wikipedia has been concerts about its accuracy&quot;. Wikipedia is still known for dilution of content. With even small flaws of things such as inaccuracy, misinformation spreads.]]>

Although this has allowed for a variety of people to share their knowledge, Shane Fitzgerald, a student from Dublin Unviersity, argued that the public and the media gave little attention to &quot;upholding accuracy and accountability in an age of instant news&quot; (Source 4). To prove his point, he chose to add false information onto the article of French composer, Maurice Jarre. Soon enough, Shane found that many people were using this false information.]]>

In Source #4, Shane Fitzgerald, a Dublin University student, &quot;posted a poetic but phony quote on Wikipedia&quot; to test how our &quot;globalized, increasingly Internet-dependent media was upholding accuracy and accountability in an age of instant news.&quot; Although the quote Fitzgerald posted on the site was fake, Wikipedia users and administrators themselves were blind to the quote's infidelity. After a month of silence, Fitzgerald decided that if he had not told the truth about his made-up quote, it &quot;would have gone down in history as something Maurice Jarre said, instead of something I made up.&quot; This proves that misinformation can not only be considered credible in daily life, but also in widespread, international history, as suggested by Fitzgerald. In his article from The Taipei Times entitled &quot;Wikipedia on an academic hit list,&quot; Noam Cohen affirms that misinformation can spread quickly. Cohen opens his piece by connecting the unreliabilty of Wikipedia to real life situations. In his Japanese history class, Neil Waters found that most of his students stated the same untrue statement in their exams. After investigation, Waters found that the &quot;obscure, though incorrect, information was from Wikipedia, the collaborative online encyclopedia, and the students had picked it up cramming for his exam.&quot; Although Wikipedia is a great source for quick, general information, its unreliability cannot be overlooked, especially in the case of a last-minute &quot;cramming session.&quot; The incorrect statement Waters identified in most of his students' exams came from the exact same place, showing that many students use Wikipedia as a resource, and consequently, any untrue information presented in Wikipedia can be directly spread to its users, and even indirectly spread to others. Therefore, the incidence in Waters' history class confirms that misinformation can spread quickly.]]>

People around the world read everything from new articles to published research papers on their phones or tablet PCs at every second. Therefore even a tiny piece of misinformation is spread around the world in an instant. To test how the media would take in misinformation posted on a Wikipedia article, Shane Fitzgerald from Dublin University placed a false quote on a Wikipedia article on Maurice Jarre. What he found was astounding. Instanly, the media, especially journalists and the news, began to use the quote on their reports. [Source #4]. The misinformation was unnoticed by some 40 million users until Fitzgerald told the media the truth. The reason this event occured is mainly because of the tendency of people to believe what is written on the Internet. They believe that Wikipedia articles have been checked by the experts before they are posted online. Second reason the misinformation can spread so quickly is that there are just so many people who use the information posted on Wikipedia. With more than 38 million users for articles in English when the articles are written in more than 270 languages [Source #2], even if the quote was online for just a few seconds, dozens or even hundreds of people would have seen that quote in that article.]]>

After the death of a famous poet, many people flocked to Wikipedia to find out more about him. Seeing an opportunity in this, a fake quote was placed in the poet's entry and it, &quot;flew straight on to dozens of blogs and newspaper Web sites in Britain, Australia and India.&quot; (4) An important event may cause an extreme spread of misinformation if it is not caught on time by Wikipedia's editors. Situations may also occur where people need to know something in order to prepare, for example students preparing for an exam. At Middlebury College, many students, &quot;asserted on exams that the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-century Japan.&quot; This need for information also can contribute to the spread of misinformation.]]>

Such as vandalism and overseeing what should and shouldn't go on the site. The accuracy of Wiki was also a problem; the Wiki resource has similar accuracy and depth to the professionally edited database. Because of these problems, misinformation can easily spread quickly and people could easily use wrong information without knowledge of it being false. In source 4, when Shane Fitzgerald posted a poetic, but fake quote on Wikipedia that French composer Maurice Jarre &quot;supossedly&quot; said, journalism blew it up without even knowing if the source was real or not. Fitzgerald did this as an experiment to see how fast false news could spread through the internet. His experiment worked seeming how most blogs and newspapers were using his phony quote. This clearly shows that when using Wikipedia it's almost taking a fifty/fifty chance that you could be using false information. Misinformation can spread like wildfire on the internet and this is a clear example of it.]]>

Source #4 is an article that tells about Shane Fitzgerald, a student at Dublin university who posted a fake quote on Wikipedia. He did it to test how well the increasingly Internet dependant media was upholding accuracy and accountability of information. Journalists and newspapers used this information, and a month went by and nobody noticed. It was not until Fitzgerald told these media outlets that the corrections began. The problem is, most consumers of these media sources do not check back for corrections. Also, many of them will tell their friends about what they heard or read. There's no doubt that there are many people who are misinformed because of Wikipedia. In Source #5, several students in a history class had the same wrong answer on an exam. It turned out that they had gotten this information from Wikipedia while studying for the test. Wikipedia has millions of users and articles.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[In Source #2 A Brief History of Wikipedia, the author Fletcher argues that Wikipedia in its earliest days has had some problems such as undecided on what should and shouldn't be in an encyclopedia. It has also had vandalism on its website. In the third paragraph of A Brief History of Wikipedia, the author argues against the accuracy of Wikipedia. In the third paragraph, it also says that &quot;no one argues that Wikipedia's content is flawless&quot;, which tells readers that the information is not accurate as relying on a encyclopedia book or other educational resources. In Source #4, a Dublin university student Shane Fitzgerald posted a quote on Wikipedia, &quot;testing how our globalized, increasingly Internet Dependent media was upholding accuracy and accountability in an age of instant news&quot;. This reveals that the present generation relies and uses the Internet often. Some readers and even media outlets may misinterpret information online especially since it is from a wellknown encyclopedia, Wikipedia. With Internet, any type of information can spread quite easily and quickly around the world.]]>

Nobody noticed the fraud that had occured, so Fitzgerald began e-mailing media outlets and the proper corrections were made.The quote was said to be by Maurice Jarre hours after the his death when in truth the quote belonged to Shawn Fitzgerald. Another example that shows Wikipedia may not always be the greatest source to use is&quot;...Wikipedia had to reckon with a slew of problems.Amon them were vandalism and the lack of fixed formula ...&quot;(Fletcher).

As part of his plan, Shane Fitzgerald, had a made-up qoute that soon began appearing on blogs and newspapers. He taught a lesson in which how &quot;quickly journalists would descend on that information without double-checking it.&quot; People just gather information from Wikipedia and do not even realize if it is true or not. Another example was provided in Source 5, when many college students &quot;asserted on exams that the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-century Japan.&quot; This indeed was the incorrect answer, but the majority had chosen it because it was seen true since it appeared in Wikipedia. It had brought incorrect information to students because they had relied on Wikipedia and had not know if that was even a correct response.]]>

Or my teacher. Problem is that everyone can write an article on the web page, doesn`t matter what they know or what they don`t know. From the article ``A Brief History of Wikipedia`` Dan Fletcher writes that Wikipedia`s biggest issue has been concerns about the accuracy. ''Britannica's in terms of accuracy - with 2.92 mistakes per article for Britannica and 3.86 or Wikipedia - no one argues that Wikipedia`s content is flawless''(source 2) From article ''Wikipedia on an academic hit list'' by Noah Cohen said that a lot of the students at Middelbury College used Wikipedia on their exams. With the information that ''the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-Century Japan, he knew something was wrong'' (Source 5). The information was false.]]>

For example, Dublin university student Shane Fitzgerald posted a fake quote on the Wikipedia page of Maurice Jarre hourse after the French composer's death on March 28. This flew straight on to dozens of U.S. blogs and ewspaper Web sites in Britain, Austrailia and India. The quote was used and spread widely because media was in pressure to produce news instantly so it resulted in the prevalent use of Wikipedia. Also, with a big and successful site, there are bound to be problems. For example, vandalism and the idea of what information to post and what information not to post.

One example would be Shane Fitzgerald's inserted quote on Maurice Jarre's Wikipedia page, appearing in dozens of media outposts (Source 4). Even still this information spreads when it is taught to students by teachers who do not do background checks on their facts. When misinformation is quoted often enough, it becomes fact. An example of this was seen when &quot;Middlebury College, Vermont, asserted on exams that the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-century Japan&quot; when in fact they were hiding (Source 5).]]>

When he realized they thay all had the same false information down he diswcovered that all of those students had gotten the false information from Wikipedia. Students then started citing Wikipedia as one of their sorces for any paper that they had to write.

A few hours after Jarre's death, Shane had posted the quote on Wikipedia and had instantly been put on dozens of U.S. blogs and newspaper Web sites in Britain, Australia and India. This showed that the media doesn't do much research at all, and use any information they can find without tracking it's source. In source #5, Neil Waters, a professor from Middlebury College, Vermont, had realized that his students are being given false information when he read the students exams. Waters had realized that the students have been getting their information from Wikipedia, and this is because they had decided to get it from the website because they had been &quot;cramming,&quot; or studying hard for his exam. Wikipedia articles are made by volunteers, and some of these volunteers are either trying to screw people over, or just aren't educated in the article they are writing. Volunteer's should be tested before being able to write articles on Wikipedia, otherwise, people will start distrusting the site and wouldn't come back to it, resulting in Wikipedia losing viewers and users, and the makers of it losing money.]]>

If people don't know the correct information, they cannot say that the information on Wikipedia is false. Explained in Source number 4, Shane Fitzgerald is a sociology major in college. He performed an experiment proving that false information could be spreaded throughout the world without anyone knowing if its true or not. He posted a false quote from a famous French composer, Maurice jarre after his death. It spread like wildfire because since Maurice was dead, nobody could argue that the quote was false. Nobody knew if Maurice wrote or said that quote before his death. People found out that it was false because Fitzgerald spoke up and said it was a false himself. If Fitzgerald didn't tell everyone the truth about the quote, that quote would still be a famous quote that people that Maurice Jarre said or wrote. Also in source number 3, they state that the reliability of wikipedia can have so skepticism because users from around the world can post any information they want and it could be true or false information. The information could still be spreaded around the world until a volunteer editor catches the misinformation and deletes it.]]>

So, if you are doing a prodject and you look up information on wikipedia then your answers may not be right. Not everything on wikipedia isn't true though. Some of the information given could be the right information, so you just have to be careful. There are other websites that also give answers that could not for true. For instance, ask.com is another website that is used for people to put in their own answers. But just because people can change it doesn't mean that its not right some people are very smart and put in the true answers. So if I was doing a research paper then I would try and make sure that the information I am given is the right information. In the fifth article the teachers don't allow the students to cite wikipedia in there reasearch papers which I think is a good thing students shouldn't be allow to cite it. Its not that it's bad it's just that its not always true.]]>

The article, published in The Seattle Times written by Shawn Pogatchnik, discussed the experiment an Irish student conducted about how information can be spread through Wikipedia. This student made up a quote about the last words of a French composer and added it to the Wikipedia page of that composer and from there it went to dozens of U.S. blogs and newspaper web sites in Britain.(Source #4). Another example of misinformation spreading quickly comes from Source #5. This article was published in The Taipei Times. In &quot;Wikipedia on an Academic Hit List&quot; by Noam Cohen. A techer bans his students from citing Wikipedia in their essays. The teacher acknowledges that although he has banned it because a lot of information was wrong the students will still use it because it is a major source of knowledge. These two articles show that misinformation that is posted on Wikipedia can be spread very quickly.]]>

For example, in the article &quot;Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media with Faking Quote,&quot; written by author Shawn Pogatchnik, presents how quickly university student Shane Fitzgerald's test of making up a false quote from past French composer Maurice Jarre spread to various journalists across the Internet. Fitzgerald's test shows how many different journalists easily copied and pasted his false quote to write and spread their own articles on Jarre's mysterious new quote. Also, in &quot;Wikipedia on an Academic Hit List&quot; written by Noam Cohen shows how quickly more than half a dozen students in Neil Waters' Japanese history class accessed an article to cram for an exam. Wikipedia is often used as a quick go-to for students who are trying to cram for essays and finals exams such as students in Waters' class and probably many students across America. The quick click of a search button on the Internet can cause students to have easy access to articles that may contain fale information that will eventually lead students and journalists to invalid articles and essays.]]>

For example, in Source 4, a Dublin university student named Shane Fitzgerald posted a fake quote of a famous French composer shortly after his death. Immediately reporters and journalists have already caught the quote and thought it was real without any evidence to back it up. Even the editors and publishers didn't check to make sure that they had evidence rather than just use Wikipedia as a reliable source. Even after a whole month no one claimed to notice that it was a fake quote and didn't do any research on it either. This shows how dependent peipke are on Wikipedia even though it had already been claimed as unreliable in some aspects. People continue to use it because so many others credit the website that they immediately assume that the website must be good. In Source 5, half of a class got a problem to a question wrong and the professor discovered that it was Wikipedia who had put the false information online. Although it's just one website, that one website was claimed to be so reliable that half a dozen students decided to use the website instead of the textbooks they were given or the information given by their teacher. Perhaps a student found the answer on Wikipedia and decided to pass it onto that student and that student decided to pass it on to another student thus causing a chain reaction.]]>

According to Fitzgerald, his privat concern was that, under pressure to produce news instantly, media outlets were increasingly relying on Internet sources (source #3) For example, in the article by Shawn Pogatcnik he announced when the death of a Oscar-winning composer news arised, Fitzgerald fabricated a quote which was used continuously by sites despite the fact there was no legitimate source. Many people are so careless and ignorant that they do not bother to fact-check anymore. This was the first time to his knowledge that an academic reseacher had places false information on a wikipedia listing specifically to test how the media would handle it.]]>

Sometimes the journalist dont check other sources before publishing, thus, leaving them with only the false information from Wikipedia. &quot;Journalist shouldn't use information they find there if it can't be traced back to a reliable primary source&quot; (source 4). It's understandably easy for students to go on Wikipedia and post false information about a subject. Students begin to fail their test and writing assignments because they believe that Wikipedia is an accurate primary source for information. The misinformation from Wikipedia can spread easily because more than thousands of students are citing this source on their essays and other writing pieces (source 5). Just being on the website alone, the false information spreads to millions of people instantly without their understanding that it's all misinformation.]]>

The experiment from Fitzgerald proved that anything posted on wikipedia is thought to be true until an editor catches the mistake. The experiment worked to prove that any information will spread if it is posted quickly and on the right topic that is most researched. THe expirement only worked because he posted the false quote quickly on a fast rowing topic that was to big for editors to catch instantly but when they did it was already to late many new papers and blogs had already posted and wrote about the fake quote.(source 4) Wikipedia is a good source for students in need of help for a project, homework, or studying for an exam. It is only helpful when the information is correct. The Middlebury school policy was put into place after many students recieved wrong information from wikipedia and got answers wrong on an exam. The school banned citation of wikipedia on exams or papers but did not ban it in total. Wikipedia has misleading information but it is very convinient for students if they find the information is correct.]]>

Althuough most people believe of it as a site for all the knowledge they can acquire,it still has its share of mistakes and misinformation in its articles. In source #2, a study was conducted in 2005 showing that wikipedia had more mistakes per article then Encyclopedia Britanica. This shows that there are more accurate statements in other sources than wikipedia, but why is this the case? Also in source #2, it alks about critcs and how they say that wikipedia is more focused on small meaningless pet projects such as Star Wars and Lord Of The Rings. &quot; Indeed, the site's list of star wars creatures totals more than 15,000 words, while the entire entry on World War II has just 10,000.&quot;(source #2). The information on Wikipedia can often be wrong and not valid due the fact that anyone can edit wikipedia. The &quot;content's reliability should be met with some skepticism, After all, it's created by users, not traditionally experts.&quot;(source #3). Now with the rapid growth of Wikipedia's popularity, more and more people are using the information posted on this site, as stated in source #1. With this being the case and knowing that a lot of the information on this site is misinformation, this shows how its misinformations spreads fast.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[While many individuals worldwide use Wikipedia, misinformation, through the medium of Wikipedia, is becoming an increasingly common trend. It is extremely simple to look up a subject on Wikipedia and to write up on the subject for a class or for some other means. While it is unlikely that most information on Wikipedia is fabricated, simply editing in false information isn't difficult. In the article, &quot;Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media with Fake Quote&quot;, by Shawn Pogatchnik of the Seattle Times. Pogatchnik reports of the social experiment that Irish student Shane Fitzgerald conducted. He made up an uncited quote that was attributed to the late Maurice Jarre. Even though the quote was uncited, dozens of blogs and newspapers worldwide had referenced this quote in their obituary articles of Jarre. A month had passed and the fabrication had not been spotted until Fitzgerald alerted the media sources. Some sources had still misattributed the quote to Jarre several weeks after Fitzgerald alerted the public. The sheer simplicity of taking a quote from a concise and popular well of information, even though the well is user-submitted and the quote had no citations of its sources proved to be too tempting for many journalists and showed the decreasing interest of firsthand sources of a subject. Another example of misinformation spread by means of Wikipedia can be seen in Noam Cohen's article in the Taipei Times, &quot;Wikipedia on an Academic Hit List.&quot; Neil Waters of Middlebury College, Vermont had seen several of his students written on exams using information that was completely incorrect. Upon further investigation, Waters discovered that Wikipedia was the source of misinformation, several of his students had used Wikipedia as a last minute cram option for their exams. As Waters had seen, convenience of sources is a reason how misinformation can be spread. It's extremely simple to apply information from Wikipedia which was found as one of the first results of an internet search, instead of looking through several pages for a source specializing in the subject. Not questioning articles of accuracy because of convenience is another reason why misinformation can easily be spread.]]>

However, Wikipedia's user-edited nature also has a problem, which is that because anyone can alter information on it, flase information can be planted or missed that leads people to false conclusions. Source #4 describes this briliantly because in that source, a student named Shane Fitzgerald intentionally posted false knowledge in order to test how the media responed and if they would factcheck it. When several blogs and media outlets started using the quote as fact, Shane stepped in and informed these outlests that he had made up the quote as an experiment. Even though the false information was brought down quickly, people had already quoted it and displayed it as fact, showing that even though the false material may be found and removed, if it is placed at a key moment in time, it can still reach millions as fact before it is resolved. This effect is evident in source #5 as well where Neil Water's Japanese history class asserted that &quot;the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-century Japan&quot; (Source #5) which was impossible because the Jesuits were few in number and those that existed were in hiding. In this case, the students used Wikipedian information as fact and didn't bother to corroborate their findings from Wikipedia with other sources in the world. Because of the misinformation, six students believed it and tried to pass it off as truth to their teacher in an essay. Both of these sources show that while Wikipedia has enormous stores of knowledge and a lot of people willing to expose and correct mistakes, it can't all be checked all at once and a smartly placed bit of misinformation can go down as truth to millions at a moments notice.]]>

The teacher harangued Wikipedia for allowing false information to posted on its site, and took furthur action to make sure students would no longer be able to cite Wikipedia in their papers. There are too factors that played into this situation: one is that Wikipedia articles are written by public users not actual experts on the topics, and two is the fact that students are increasingly using the internet for the majority of their research needs. Because most of the site's articles are writing by everyday Joes, the risk for error is about 3.86 mistakes per article (Source # 2). The increase in student use of the internet also caused many of them to cite the source incorrectly.]]>

One exmaple can be seen from a quote supposedly from the dying lips of Maurice Jarre posted onto Wikipedia. While many journalists were quick to take in the information as accurate, it turns out that the &quot;poetic but phony quote&quot; was created as an experiment to see how people would take it. The event at Middlebury College in Vermont is another example that also shows that promising information and pressure is a factor in how misinformation can be spread quickly. Under the stress of exams, many of Neil Waters' students turned to Wkipedia for help but found and used &quot;obscure , though incorrect, information&quot;(Cohen).]]>

In the artical &quot;Wikipedia on academic hit list&quot; Cohen talks about the fact that many students put false information on a test that they recived from Wikipedia. The reason that many student had believed the information as truthful was because they were craming for the test in that state of mind and panic you will believe anything that sounds familar or sounds like the truth. The artical &quot;A Brief History of Wikipedia&quot; also supports the reason this false information spreads is due to the fact that people will believe anything they read. The artical discusses the fact that people who read false statements made by others, such as the bais members of the Curch of Scientology, do not look futher to see if the information posted is true. Even source number three says that the facts in the articals &quot;should be met with some skepticism.&quot;]]>

But in the source 3 demostrated sometimes wikipedia its not true or sometimes doesnt had a lot information so then experts say you need search in blogs or pages of professionals because wikipedia dont have much and put a little information that they got of the real pages. that is the result for what its not a big percent of wikipedia users.

Another factor to the quickly spreading misinformation is that many students, not only in middle schools and high schools, but also colleges are using Wikipedia and trusting it as a valid and correct source. &quot;The obscure, though incorrect, information was from Wikipedia, the collaborative online encyclopedia, and the students had picked it up cramming for an exam.&quot; (Source 5) This shows that anyone anywhere in the world can find incorrect information and use it for anything they want, causing it to spread all over the place.]]>

Also in Source #5 Noam Cohen writes about how students had used Wikipedia for &quot;cramming&quot; for an exam lead them to false information. When the teacher put forth the time to figure out how the students were all getting the same false information, he was lead to Wikipedia and set a new rule, &quot; that Wikipedia could not be cited in papers or exams, and that studen6ts could not point 'point to Wikipedia or any similar source that may appear in the future to escape consequences of errors.'&quot; in that article it also showed how misinformation posted on Wikipedia can spread quickly.]]>

In its earlier days, Wikipedia had to deal with issues such as &quot;vandalism and the lack of a fixed formula for determining what should and should not be included in an encyclopedia unconstrained by physical limits&quot; (Source 2). This made it easy for hackers to feed people the wrong facts, and to instead write about subjects that are completely bizzare. The lack of hard facts can also mislead those who wish to know the real answers. When student Shane Fitzgerald of Dublin University posted a phony quote on the page of French composer Maurice Jarre, an obituarist used that quote when writing about Jarre (Source 4). Fitzgerald's experiment, in this case, was a success, showing how journalists rely on Wikipedia and do not take the time to review their sources. These are a few of the several ways Wikipedia presents minsinformation.]]>

Dublin university studen Shane Fitzgerald posted a false quote on the Wikipedia page of Maurice Jarre which was picked up my many media outlets. Even though the quote was quickly removed by editors and administrators, the media stood by the false information for many months later. (Irish 2011) Because of the pressure to constantly produce instant news, many media outlets rely on internet sources that may not be entirely true. In Middlebury College, Neil Waters noticed that his students used information posted on Wikipedia about the Shimabara Rebellion that was false.

The writers and editors did not double check the validity of the statement showing how careless they are. (Source 4).]]>

An example of this would be when an &quot;Irish student hoaxes world's media with a fake quote&quot; (Source #4). He said how he was &quot;testing how our globalized, increasingly Internet-dependent media was upholding accuracy and accountability in an age of instant news.&quot; And with fooling nearly the entire world, his point was pretty much proven. Many people access Wikipedia for either the same or various reasons, but nevertheless, it is a source that most people rely on, despite whether the information is true or false. According to Source #3, Wikipedia articles are &quot;Created by users, not traditional 'experts'&quot;, so anyone could edit or write articles and put down false information, and people would read it and believe it anyways. And with many people using Wikipedia to search up the same, popular thing, false information could easily spread.]]>

Anyone can go on Wikipedia and post whatever they like. Many people have posted false information on Wikipedia just to see if the world would recognize the false information. Shane Fitzgerald was the first person to come out and say that he posted something false on Wikipedia. His explantion said that, &quot;he was testing how our globalized, increasingly Internet-dependent media was upholding accuracy and accountability in an age of instant news&quot; (Source #4). Wikipedia is also supposed to have users specifically for editing the false information posted on the website. It is hard to edit all the posts quickly before the false information is already spread. Source #2 tells us that, &quot;as the project grew, vandalization and dilution of the encyclopedia's content became more difficult to address.&quot;]]>

This may happen due to laziness or pressure from outside sources. As with Fitzgerald's sociology experiment of how quickly information moves, ther was a &quot;pressure to produce news instantly,&quot; leading the &quot;media outlets [to be] increasingly relying on Internet sources&quot; (#4). The pressure is also noted in a Japanese college class in Vermont, where &quot;students had picked it up cramming for [an] exam&quot; (#5). While this may also show laziness, it is clear that with the pressures to keep up with our fast-paced society that there is a greater need for information quickly.

Even after the Irish student's hoax in source number 4, &quot;it flew straight on to dozens of U.S blogs and newspaper Web sites in Britain, Australia and India&quot; (The Seattle Times). The quote further demonstrates the actions of the media to be the first to have the knowledge. The media searches information on Wikipedia and it is incorrect to some extent, the media still provides the wrong information to the public and the public listens. The public recieves the misinformation because they rely on the media to provide them with the correct information. Blogs and the news spread the misinformation and the public later spreads the misinformation that they believe is correct. The same thing occurred in Middlebury College, Vermont; &quot;half a dozen students..asserted on exams&quot; the wrong information and were returned with low scores for the reason of using wrong information (The Taipei Times). Many students were allowed to use Wikipedia as a source for information during highschool; that is how the misinformation spread. Teachers were allowing students to believe the misinformation was correct in high school therefore, students began to spread the news to other students causing a spread to use the misinformed Wikipedia. All the misinformed information from wikipedia spread at a much faster rate due to the media and also by the high school teachers. All the authorities like the teachers and the power of the media influence many people to believe that Wikipedia's given information is reliable. Furthermore, the public will continue to spread the misinformation.]]>

The amount of information found on Wikipedia is large, yet its reliability and validity may not be as accurate as one thinks. The information which Wikipedia presents is produced by &quot; ordinary users instead of experts (source 3).&quot; The database for information comes from placing one's faith in the accuracy and knowledge of another person who may not know all there is to know when it relates to certain article posted on Wikipedia. Thus as more users use Wikipedia and may help another person, the spread of false information mutiplies as more people rely on Wikipedia. The social experiment to measure the rates of globalization by Dublin's Shane Fitzgerald took &quot; less than three minutes ot fabricate a false quote (source 4)&quot; which spread across the globe triggered the fear of the spread of false information. As the experiment revealed that the growth of internet usage leads to faster communication between computer systems, one can only imagine that the &quot;quick quote&quot; took less than twenty-four hours to be distributed across the globe. This fast spread of false information is born form unreliable sources which is then amplified by the enhancement of fast internet. Wikipedia and its datbase of knowledge, in an instant, can spread faulty information in minutes and as more people use it the rate only quickens, raising the price of using Wikipedia.]]>

Students may go to the Internet for help, and the first source that appears is Wikipedia. When students copy information on Wikipedia, the information is un-reliable. Many examples of this have ocurred during school, such as in Dublin University, when student Shane Fitzegerald. The author of this articles reveals that &quot;Wikipedia passed.

Because of this information and misinformation posted on Wikipedia can spread very quickly as shown in an article by The Seattle Times. An Irish student is able to bewilder the world with a quote he had written posing as a recently deceased French Composer. As an &quot;experiment&quot; to see how fast misinformation can be posted, this Irish student had posted a poetic but phony quote on Wikipedia, and it was swallowed by society. Wikipedia is also shown as a source for misinformation produced by an article from The Taipei Times by Noam Cohen, where students were using misinformation that they had picked up from Wikipedia on a test and getting it wrong. This can easily happen because as students, we are faced with many tests throughout our school years and in order to study for this we turn to the Internet. The Internet provides an easy to access style that many students eagerly need and Wikipedia is a site that provides all that for students like these. Wikipedia is a source that provides mainly legitimate claims and facts, however, there are few that are not and because of this they are not recommended by many teachers. In an ever-changing society that seeks for information faster than the next guy, Wikipedia holds the key to it. Yes they arent always correct, but when searching for the key, we don't always check for if it can open the right door.]]>

In source #4, Scott Fitzgerald posted a poetic yet phony quote onto a Wikipedia page to see how our Interent-dependent media can fix this error and uphold its accuracy. However, the media failed this test as the media copy and paste this misinformation onto the their web or citing it onto the newspapers. A full month went by as no one realized this misinformation to much of Fitzgerald disappointment. If it wasn't for Fitzgerald for pointing out this editorial fraud, it would've been spread and, even worse, go down in history. In addition to the spread of misinformation, in source #5, Neil Waters pointed out an error on Wikipedia that it had misguiding students through the misinformation cited onto it when they were studying for the semester finals. Because on this misguided information, it spreaded throughout the student body. Because of Wikipedia misinformation it caused people to do mistakes and not fix since they depend on Wikipedia too much as if it was flawless.]]>

They say that wikipedia is on point with cancer information, but they are not clear or hard to understand. This can lead to misinformation and it could possibly spread to other sites because of wrong information given. In source number 4 a Dublin university student Shane Fitzgerald decided to do an experiment by posting a quote he made up. He added this quote on the wikipedia page of Maurice Jarre recently after his death. He made wanted to test this experiment to see how the world's internet-dependent media was attaining accuracy in the age of instant news. Even though the adminstrators of the page deleted the quote, some journalists were too quick and used cut and paste. A month later he came out saying that it was his quote and was just a fraud. He then said &quot;It would have become another example where, once anything is printed enought times in the media without challenge, it becomes a fact.&quot; This means that people can get away with posting fake information on wikipedia and can simply fool others. It can easily trick researchers if they have not seen any other information other than the writings in wikipedia. In source number two it states &quot;with 2.92 mistakes per article for Britannica and 3.86 for Wikipedia no one argues that Wikipedia's content is flawless.&quot;]]>

Source #4, published by The Seattle TImes, is about a hoax of a fake quote uploaded. Wikipedia allows anyone to use it, leading to many people believing it since so many people edit different articles all the time. An Irish student made up a quote, then uploaded it to Wikipedia which caused an uproar by numerous people reviewing that said article. &quot;The sociology major's made-up quote... flew straight on to dozens of U.S. blogs and newspaper Web sites in Britain, Austrailia and India.&quot; Since many people look at Wikipedia, most information people see on it believe it without going through much effort to see if the actual information is legitimate. The last source, Source #5 is about the inaccuracy of Wikipedia which is being used by numerous students around the world. The downside that people found was that the students, praised for researching, were however finding inaccurate research which didn't benefit their actual knowledge. &quot;... about a year ago that students were citing Wikipedia as a source in their papers. When confronted, many would say that their high school teachers had allowed the practice. But the errors on the test last semester were the last straw.&quot; Since so many people have access to the internet, the ability to find the wrong information is endless, the main site searched being Wikipedia. Numerous teachers admit that Wikipedia is inaccurate but still find Wikipedia semi-useful. &quot;'I guess I am not terribly impressed by anyone citing an encyclopedia as a reference point, but I am not against using it as a starting point.&quot; Even teachers find that Wikipedia can help students, but want to make the students understand that Wikipedia shouldn't be their primary source or even their only sourcce. Wikipedia in the long run is controversial for many people to how useful it is. But the main issue is how fast the misinformation would spread to others, which in the long run woud decieve people and lead them to continously remember incorrect information.]]>

In source 4, a fake quote is added to the the Wikipedia page of a composer who recently passed away. Although the quote is removed promptly due to its inaccuracy, many blogs and newspapers immediately incorporate it into their articles. This shows how media constantly wants to be the first to spread new information. Misinformation also spreads quickly due to time constraint in addition to necessity. When students need information quickly, Wikipedia is always right there to save the day as shown in source 5. When students are rushing, they usually pay less attention to detail and are just looking for an answer of some sort. They tend to go to the first site that pops up (which is usually Wikipedia) because it is the easiest thing to do. When students are rushing, their focus is getting things done rather than doing hard work, which opens up the opportunity for error.]]>

And when looking up something on a database, Wikipedia is almost also the first link to appear. Therefore thousands of people go to Wikipedia for their research. For example, an article in The Seattle Times by Shawn Pogatchnik told a story about a young college student who put up a fake quote on one of the Wikipedia pages. He wanted to see how well the Wikipedia editors would catch his mistake and fix it. Unfortunately, even though the false quote was removed soon after its original posting, too many people had seen it. It then ended up in various news articles, which led many people to believe it was a true quote.]]>

But before he removed it, dozens of newspapers and blogs around the world had already read and used the fabricated quote. The major stated,&quot;A full month went by and nobody noticed the editorial fraud.&quot; so e-mailed several of the media outlets, explaining what he did and they began their corrections. He stated that he was positive that if he hadn't come forward about his phony quote, it would have went down in history as something Jarre had said. This information was postedon Wikipedia, an exponentially growing cite, that is accesible to people all around the world, it's no wonder misinformation is a growing problem all across the globe. Misinformation is not only a problem in media, but is also be a problem in schools. In source #5 it talks about this student who answered exams questions with information he thought was true. He got the information from Wikipedia while he was trying to study for a test.

After all it's created by users not tradtional &quot;experts&quot;. &quot;Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media With Fake Quote&quot; by Shawn Pogatchnik, Dublin Universtity student Shane Fitzgerald posted a poetic but phony quote on Wikipedia he added to the Wikipedia page of Maurice Jarre hours after the French composer's death March 28. When Fitzgerald saw British 24-hour news channels reporting the death of the triple Oscar- winning composer he called a &quot;gold opportunity&quot; for an experiment on media use of Wikipedia. This is why we cant trust the information on Wikipedia we dont know if its right or wrong unless we really know if its on the news or a official source of information.]]>

Another study led by a university showed that many students used Wikipedia for researches and that they often had many mistakes and in test most if them put a certain choice of question given to the fake knowledge given by the site. This university has banned the online siteing of this page, but they are still concerned that sutudens around the world use the site that still has a high rate of vamdalism in it, they even believe that even with the &quot;army&quot; of editors that Wikipedia has not all of the information is safe from being manipulated.]]>

This idea can be clearly seen in Article #4, &quot;Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media with Fake Quote&quot;, in which Dublin university student Shane Fitzgerald posted a fake quote on Wikipedia that was used by many media outlets despite being removed from Wikipedia within a few hours. Once the quote was revealed to be a hoax, the reader's editor at The Guardian, one of the newespapers that posted the fake quote, stated, &quot;The moral of this story is not that journalists should avoid Wikipedia, but that they shouldn't use information they find there if it can't be traced back to a reliable primary source.&quot; Another example of lack of outside fact checking causing misinformation from Wikipedia to spread can be seen in Article #5, &quot;Wikipedia on an Academic Hit List&quot;. This article describes a case when a number of students in a Japanese history class at Middlebury College used the same false argument in their essay, stemming from an incorrect fact found on Wikipedia. This led to the college professor banning the citing of Wikipedia as a source, stating that it should only be used a first step to finding reliable sources. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales agreed with this policy, stating, &quot;They are recommending exactly what we suggested-students shouldn't be citing encyclopedias.&quot; This article also proves that Wikipedia can be a useful tool, but without fact-checking it with outside information, incorrect information can spread quickly.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[In source #4, Pogatchnik explains the story of a student named Fitzgerald posting a phony quote on a composers page after the composers death. Fitzgerald was testing if media would be able to notice if this is a credible source or if they would remove it for being a fraud. The media however, through its hunger to spread what it can, 'cut and paste' the quote without checking its source. Although Wikipedia removed the quote, the media never noticed the fraud until Fitzgerald came out and explained what had happened. Supporting this, Pogatchnik states, &quot;I am 100-percent convinced that if i hadn't come forward, that quote would have gone down in history as something Maurice Jarre said, instead of something i made up. It would have become another example where, once anything is printed enough times in the media without challenge. it becomes a fact.&quot; This quote is an example on how the misinformation that was posted on Wikipedia spread and that was because of media. Another source would be source #5, written by Noam Cohen on a japanese history class professor noticing that exams that were turned in held multiple and repeated errors. The professor, Neil Waters, concludes that,&quot;The obscure, though incorrect, information was from Wikipedia, the collaborative online encyclopedia, and the students had picked it up cramming for his exam.&quot; However, this was not a good thing. The wikipedia source gave away different information, usually incorrect, and he noticed this in the exam. Cohen writes that, &quot;But the errors on the test last semester were the last straw,&quot; and furthermore explains Waters' determination to stop wikipidea from being a cited source on papers or exams becuase of the misinformation.]]>

When students are obligated to complete something at a certain time, they will use anything they can to just get it done.Wikipedia can easily be edited by anyone who can put whatever they want, with no evidence or credibility. The Pew Research Center states &quot;the percentage of American adults who use Wikipedia to look for information increased from 25% in February 2007 to 42% in May 2010.&quot; The more Americans using this site, the more likely people are to use the content provided in the sites they read. With over one million articles, it is inevitable for some people to get information without using Wikipedia. It's extremely popular so people already believe it's a credible source, even if it's not. Thus, causing students and adult to be misinformed about many topics.]]>

In Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media With Fake Quote Shawn Pogatchnik, reports that a student from Dublin university named Shane Fitzgerald, posted a quote of his own on Maurice Jarre after hours of his death. Fitzgerald conducted a little experiment to see how gualible people are and see if people would use Wikipedia as source. It seemed like Fitzgerald wanted to prove a point that everything on Wikipedia is not accurate or trust worthy. In Wikipedia On An Academic Hit List Noam Cohen, explains how Middlebury College banned of quoting or citing Wikipedian on their exams because wikipedia's information was inaccurate making students fail their exams.]]>

Japanese history teacher Neil Waters figured this out when half a dozen of his students stated a wrong answer on their exams. He found the fault to be where they got their information. &quot;The obscure, though incorrect, information was from Wikipedia,&quot; (5) and the students picked it up while studying the night before. Another instance when public posting effected people was when a Dublin university student posted a quote just to see if anyone would fall for it. Less than 15 minutes was the time it took for Shane Fitzgerald to come up with a fake quote for the death of Maurice Jarre. But no one seemed to notice it was fake even after a month, and that's when he reached out to media outlets via e-mail and began correcting others. Fitzgerald was, &quot;really shocked at the results from the experiment,&quot; he didn't know it would reach this high. (4)]]>

Fitzgerald claimed to do this as a test. He wanted to see if it would be noticed as fraud or not. The quote went unnoticed, and was copy and pasted on to other web pages until Fitzgerald came out about the error. So many journalists just copied the information without checking if there was an accurate source to back the quote up. This shows that false information can spread very quickly.]]>

Because society has become so dependent on Internet information and milloins of people seek to Wikipedia for answers, a false statement can be posted and believed by many people in a matter of seconds. Tami Dennis wrote in an article of Wikipedia's credibilty ,&quot;But that content's reliability should be met with some skepticism. After all, it's created by users, not traditional &quot;experts&quot;.(source #3). Anyone who has an account on wikipedia can change or add whatever information they would like onto Wikipedia without having to be on expert on a subject. IT could be their opinoin, or rather just a bias comment.]]>

If people find wrong information on Wikipedia they can put it in their work which will be wrong when they hand it back to whoever was asking for it. The wrong information then gets passed out everywhere. People can be in a rush to finish something they have been working on for a long time and then find out they have wrong information and then they will have to go back to the beginning of their work just to have to fix what they thought was right all along.

To protect against vandalisma and misinformation being added to the page Wikipedia has &quot;a volunteer army of editors&quot; who make sure that nothing incorrect gets added (Source #2). However, this volunteer army may take some time to catch every mistake in all 1 million or more articles. There is a log created, but oftentimes the mistakes aren't caught quick enough. In the incident described in Source #4, the encyclopedia caught and removed the fake quote, &quot;but not quickly enough to keep some journalists from cutting and pasting it first&quot; (Source #4). Since people are one Wikipedia all the time, any misinformation not caught immediately can be snagged by someone and used as correct if not found elsewhere.]]>

Even though these mishaps are usually fixed within minutes or hours it can sometimes have a big affect. Such as Shane Fitzgerald posting a fake poetic quote on the page of Maurice Jarre hours after the french composers death. Where many Journalists and Blogs began to put in thier obituraries. Fitzgerlad said &quot; I am 100 percent convinced that if I hadn't come foward, that quote would have gone down in history as something Maurice Jarre said instead of something I made up.&quot; &quot;It would have become another example where, once anything is printed enough time in the media without challenge, it becomes fact.&quot; - &quot;Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media With Fake Quote&quot; by The Seattle Times. A study shown by Nature found &quot;that Wikipedia's science entiries came close to matching the Encyclopedia Britannica's in terms of accuracy-with 2.92 mistakes per article for Britannica and 3.86 for Wikipedia- no one argues that Wikipedias content is flawless.&quot; This also shows that although that wikipedia can be a credible source most of the time, it is not always right.]]>

Just take for example, Shane Fitzgerald, for when he posted a poetic but phony quote on Wikipedia about a recently dead composer, it &quot;flew straight on to dozens of U.S. blogs and newspaper Web sites in Britain, Australia, and India.&quot; (Source 4). Journalists and other individuals that thrive to have the story first or get their article out on time rush to internet sources to fufill that request. Even Wales said &quot;If they put out a statement not to read Wikipedia at all, I would be laughing. They might as well say don't listen to rock 'n' roll either. (Source 5). With students and adults frequently using Wikipedia for their studies and other purposes, the misinformation posted can spread quickly.]]>

One of these examples came from the article Irish Student hoaxes world's media with fake quote. In this artcile it tells of a Dublin university student named Shane Fitzgerald, who after the death of Maurice Jarre, posted a fake quote that he made up on the Jarres Wikipedia page. Immeditaley this fake quote had been put into circulation by the media, although Wikipedia caught on that it was false, and pulled it down. This shows why misinformation posted on Wikipedia can spread quickly because it shows how social media, has a drive to get information on a hot topic, as quickly as possible. And since Wikipedia is the first source seen usually on a webpage, it shows how quickly it can spread becasue it will be the first place people will go to get information on a topic. Since it is so popular and easily accessable, it explains why misinformation from wikipedia can spread so quickly. In source #5 another reason why Wikipedias possible misinformation posts can spread quickly because of the college students who all used the wrong information in his exams. It shows that it is the first place people go, because they have grown to trust Wikipedia. Since Wikipedia is so easily accessable, it gives another reason why this information can spread so quickly because it is the easiet source to find information on, and we dont look to other sources, thus allowing false information to travel much quicker.]]>

In source 4, the article takes time to explain how misguided information that is placed on wikipedia can spread at a quick pace through websites, newspapers, and even countries. Why does this happen though? Well, its easy. People look to wikipedia for quick information on a topic. Journalists and students want to know as much information they can get on a topic in one area like wikipedia offers. Many people don't go back and double check the information so when there are errors with the information they are dealing with. Students also do the same thing. According to source 5, a school in Vermont is trying to get wikipedia banned from their school so students can't use it for a source on tests or essays. It was found that students were using wikipedia to study for a test and they foud faulty information. they then didnt take the time to double check the information which affected their grade. Misinformation can spread quickly when posted on wikipedia because people trust it too much. they dont double check their information which causes them to use misinformation and people trust them which then leads to a spiral downward.]]>

As in source #4, a student can post any information that they wish to post, such as a fake quote by a recently diseased celebrity. This information spread throughout the media because the users of Wikipedia were lazy and careless. It is not very hard to go on a search engine and search for a quote. When the quote appeared nowhere but the Wikipedia article, a red flag should have gone off. Also, the journalists who misused this information should have seen that the quote was not cited and therefore was not reliable. Students are another group prone to misuse of the information on Wikipedia. Students want a quick, easy way to get the research that they need for a paper or an exam. Wikipedia is the solution. However, in that panicked, rushed state, students are often too careless to check the information that they find, or don't even notice that the information is not cited. The users of this famous online encyclopedia are the ones to blame for the misuse of the information presented online.]]>

In paragraph 6 of source 5, it also says that Middlebury's history department banned Wikipedia from being used as a source.

Source # 2 explains just why this what happening and how Wikipedia has worked to solve this problem. &quot;...Amoung them were vandalism and the lack of a fixed formula for determining what should and shouldn't be included in an encyclopedia unconstrained by physical limitations. The emerging community included a volunteer army of editors, who helped to keep the content aligned with Wikipedia's rules...&quot; The poor guidelines set by Wikipedia when it first came out was a big reason as to why the sources and information on the website were invalid. This has since been changed. Source # 4 gave a good example of just how fast false information can spread because of Wikipedia by telling the story of a boy named Shane Fitzgerald who made up a quote who he claimed was said by Maurice Jarre hours after the French composer's death. This quote made its way to dozens of blogs and newspaper Web sites in the U.S., Britain, Australia, and India. Fitzgerald said, &quot;The used fabricated material even though administrators at the free online encyclopedia quickly caught the quote's lack of attribution and removed it, but not quickly enough to keep some journalists from cutting and pasting it first.&quot; Months had gone on and yet nobody noticed the false information untl Fitzgerald had told several media outlets. Fitzgerald concluded by stating, &quot;I am 100-percent convinced that if I hadn't come forward, that quote would have gone down in history as something Maurice Jarre said, instead of something I made up. It would have become another example where, once anything is printed enough times in the media without challenge, it becomes fact.&quot;]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Misinformation posted on Wikipedia can spread quickly. This likely occurs because the media of today's world doesn't always uphold accuracy, especially when we live in a world that feeds off of instant news. In source #4, an article titled 'Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote' written by Shawn Pogatchnik, Pogatchnik explains how society's desire for instant news allows many to be gullible and believe anything on the internet. In the article, Pogatchnik writes, &quot;When Dublin university student Shane Fitzgerald posted a poetic but phony quote on Wikipedia, he said he was testing how our globalized, increasingly Internet-dependent media was upholding accuracy and accountability in an age of instant news. His report card: Wikipedia passed. Journalism flunked.&quot; Pogatchnik goes on to add...&quot;The sociology major's made up quote flew straight on to dozens of U.S. blogs and newspaper Web sites in Britain, Austrailia and India.&quot; Here, the author of source #4 demonstrates how rapidly, and how far away, false information can spread. Misinformation posted on Wikipedia can also spread quickly due to the fact that it has a very wide audience. Source #5, titled 'Wikipedia on an academic hit list' written by Noam Cohen states that, &quot;Indeed, the English-language version of the Web site had an estimated 38 million users in the US in December, and can be hard to avoid while on the Internet.&quot; Because so many people have access to and are able to see false information on Wikipedia, this information spreads at a much higher rate.]]>

Therefore, if there's something on there that's incorrect, people don't know it is, and so they think it's correct and that's how false information can spread. In source #4, it says how a fake quote was found and written in newspaper as fact, even though it wasn't. If it's in the newspaper, people will automatically believe what's being said on there. They always think it's found from a reliable source. In this case, Wikipedia, a non-reliable source was used for it. Samething with Source #5. Wikipedia is banned from citations because it is not a reliable source and false information can easily be said using that site.]]>

In &quot;Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote&quot; (source #4), the author Shawn Pogatchnik tells a story of a Dublin university student posted a fake quote on wikipedia. Shawn was testing how quick Wikipedia was to find the inaccuracy in this quote. Misinformation can spread quickly on wikipedia because as soon as it is online people are quick to copy and paste this information and there are thousands of articles administrators have to check. By the time an administrator checked the article it would be late and they might not even have found the mistake. Shawn had to email the organization after a month went by without his fake quote being changed. This is one example of how misinformation posted on Wikipedia can spread quickly. Source #5 also provides an accurate example of how quickly misinformation can spread on Wikipedia. In &quot;Wikipedia on an academic hit list&quot; A professor of Middlebury College found an error in students' papers regarding the Shimabara Rebellion in Japan. He then realized that the source of this error was from Wikipedia. This innacurate information had been on Wikipedia long enough for students to use it in their papers and recieve a bad grade due to the wrong information. These sources support the arguement that misinformation posted on Wikipedia can spread quickly.]]>

Wikipedia does this by projecting information with &quot;restictions&quot; that have little enforecement and unqualified writers (this kind of format is uncommon in everyday life, for example this &quot;assesment&quot;). An example of this idiocracy is stated in &quot;A Brief History of Wikipedia&quot; where the issue of accuracy has been left in the hands of offcentered writers, with the topic of a popular SCIENCE FICTION movie Star Wars being a more detailed page then the American Civil War, AKA one of the most defining events in world history (yes, world history, not just American history). Even though Wikipedia can translate pages, this is not a reedeming quality, just as google translate isn't a reasonable tool due to the exreme inacuracies. Its especially jarring that Wikipedia wouild even think to spread more ill suported information to various countries when they can't even get their facts right in english verisions.

This is clearly shown in the sheer amount of college students who both used Wikipedia as one of their Sources, and also proceeded to use wrong evidence to support themselves during final exams(Source 5). Wikipedia however, is not solely at fault. In Scource 4 it can be seen that the people who write popular news articles should be held more accountable for misinformation as they do not check their source material for accuracy as much as they should.]]>

Another instance is in source 5 where students are using wikipedia as a source for exams and essays. The misinformation was consistantly used in many students essays, and the idea rapidly spread.

I want to go on the water. water is much better then land work outs. some teams are lucky they have been on the water for the past couple of weeks. we have yet to get on the water.]]>

(4) This shows our dependence on the internet and what we will believe if it gives us the information in a quickjy, ane easy fashion. Another example of an inccident like ths one happened at MIddlebury College, Vermont where students were taking misinformation from Wikipedia. The article states, &quot;He figured out the problem soon enough. The obscure, though incorrect, information was from Wikipedia, the collabroative online encylopedia, and the students had picked it up cramming for his exam.&quot; (5) Students are using this as an easy access way to pick up information. Many people use Wikipedia because it is very easy to find the information needed, even if it is not neccessarily true.]]>

I doubt this is what you wanted to do as a child, am I right? Then get off your booty and do something that makes a change for the world, or be creative with your life or something. I know, a job like that can't be easy to find, but did you really look hard enough? Something's bound to be out there. One job. Just one job, because I'm sure you're not happy doing this for the rest of you're life until you retire. You know I'm right for once. Then again, I'm just a kid right? And I don't know anything about the real world or the struggles of finding a good job in this economy, or what it means to have responcibility (I think I spelled that right, I'm telling you, go tell your boss to add spell check) in order to feed two kids and a wife. But I'll be damned if I give up on my dream to be a Police Officer. Or a Corrections Officer, I'm still figuring it out, but give me slack I still have a year or two to figure it out. I don't see why you can't swing your life around, it's never too late to go back to school and try to find another job while you do whatever job this is called. I don't mean to insult you, I'm just trying to give you some youthful advice.]]>

This exact thing happened when a college student by the name of Shane Fitzgerald posted a fake quote on the website. While the gatekeepers of Wikipedia took the quote down, many media outlets had already taken it and published it themselves (Source 3). This also may happen when students in school are researching a topic and use Wikipedia as a source. If they come across faulty information, they may begin to tell their classmates this is true as well, and soon people everywhere have heard about this wrong information. This is what happened at Middlebury College in Vermont when too many students believed everything they read on Wikipedia (Source 5).]]>

In Source #4, it shows that the Dublin University student Shane Fitzgerald posted a phony quote and it proves that it spreads because &quot;...even though administrators at the free online encyclopedia quickly caught the quote's lack of attribution and removed it, but not quickly enough to keep some journalists from cutting and pasting it first.&quot; ('Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media With Fake Quote' by Shawn Pogatchnik.

Source 4 was about a student put a made up quote on the page of Maurice Jarre after he died. Instantly, blogs, news papers, and websites were using the quote, despite the fact that it wasn't cited with a source. Once the quote was out online there was no stopping it. Even if Wikipedia deleted the addition to the page; it was still out circlling around the worlds' press. Journalists or anyone that sees something aren't thinking of looking for a realiable source. This is proven from the journalists that used Fitzgeralds' false quote about Maurice Jarre or people that surf the web looking for a certain topic because;In source 5 it states, Wikipedia is the first entry shown on websites like Google making it nearly impossible to avoid. So if Wikipedia is part of the first websites shown then anyone viewing the information can circulate the subject around like it's noothing. The Wikipedia system has about 1,500 volunteer administrators that are trained to spot new additions made on pages. The administrators remove any bogus, fabricated, or biased additions in a relatively fast time. In the situation of source 4, the administrators removed the bogus quote in minutes to an hour but it was still the subject of blogs and websites around the globe.]]>

People that were allowed to edit articles like The Church of Scientology were making edits that they beleieved were correct not something that people could choose a side on (source 2), so when people read an article written by a group that should be trusted but is biased they are getting this misinformation and using it to either educate themselves orto falsely educate others withkut even knowing that they are doing so. The factt that anything can be posted onto Wikepedia before it is edited and looked through carefully is another way that misinfomation is sent out. Sociology student Shane Fitzgerald decided to make up a quote and post it with information on Maurice Jarre's Wikepedia page after he died and this quote was printed out copy and pasted onto blogs and newspaper everyone believing that this quote was in fact Maurices and not the fabricated quote made up by Fitzgerald (Source 4).]]>

We see how quickly this was spread as they elaborate on how many newspapers and blogs chose this quote to print in the obituary. The media outlets were extremely quick to pick up the quote, but took over a month to realize the fraud. Source five also touches on the point of quickly spread misinformation from Wikipedia. Students were able to grab a hold of this data while cramming for their tests the next day. These situations both happened because the information was overly accessible and those who used it automatically trusted the sources.]]>

Even with a large team of editors the site has grown so large that it is difficult to control information quickly. Source #4 talks one case where false information spread quickly. This was not due to Wikipedia's failure to edit. The false information was taken down within the hour. Rather, the infomation spread because so many people, including journalists, were willing to take the information straight from wikipedia without checking it first. The reason misinformation can spread so quickly is because it has some problems making it not always reliable, and people trust it as reliable.]]>

This is true because in Source 4 when Dublin university student shane Fitzgerald posted a poetic but phony quote on Wikipedian, Source 4 quoted ' They used the fabricated material, Fitzgerald said, even though administrators at the free online encyclopedia quickly caught the quote's lack of attribution and removed it, but not quickly to keep some journalist from cutting and pasting first.&quot;This quote is important because it show that there are journalist that be looking for imformation on Wikipedia.Another reason why the misinformation spread quickly is because Wikipedia have article in a lot of different languages. I know this because Source #2 quoted &quot; Wikipedia now contains more than 13 million articles in 217 different languages.' this show that when someone post something on Wikepidia there are peoples from all around the world reading about it.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[It is not unheard of that misinformation posted on Wikipedia can spread quickly. This can be caused both by users not following-up out of desperation and/or blind acceptance. For example, in Neil Waters' Japanese history class at Middlebury College, multiple students in the class used the same &quot;obscure, though incorrect, information&quot; on their exams. Waters was able to trace the information back to Wikipedia and conclude that the students were desperate for quick study materials while cramming (Cohen). In the same light, Source #4 reports on an experiment preformed by an Irish student on how quickly false information on Wikipedia spreads. In response to his experiment's astonishing, alarming results, the student, Shane Fitzgerald, says, &quot;If anything...he expected newspapers to avoid his quote because it had no link to a source-and even might trigger alarms as 'too good to be true.' But many blogs and several newspapers used the quotes at the start or finish of their obituaries&quot; (Pogatchnik). Both these examples are because anyone can edit the information on Wikipedia at any time. While there are notifications that are sent to the Wikipedia staff so they can validate the updates, there are many more updates than staff members. This shows how easily misinformation can spread and how little effect the Wikipedia editing staff has on the public information.]]>

For some reason, they want to make it so Wikipedia is not entirely accurate, causing them to lose visitors, losing money. However, that hasnt stopped them at all. With their &quot;volunteer army of editors&quot; Wikipedia now keeps track of changes by high-profile offenders such as the Church of Scientology.

The Jesuits were in 'no position to aid a revolution', he said: the few of them in Japan were in hiding. He figured out the problem soon enough. The obscure, though incorrect, information was from Wikipedia&quot; (5).]]>

(source 2) There is over 13 million articles on the Wikipedia website, with a lot of different languages. People may not have all of the same information and could not have it 100% accurate. People make mistakes and some of their mistakes are not edited that quickly, actually some of them are not even edited at all. (source 3) Schools have been doing exams in Japanese, a kid Neil Waters noticed a big error when he was reading a paper. He relized that something was wrong on the paper. Students should not have to worry about when spending a very long time on a paper that the information is wrong and they can get points off on the grade becasue the webstie they looked on has wrong things written.

Therefore, its likely that some of the information that some people have to provide may be invalid. The first article confirms this by saying that there is a massive need for editors. &quot;The emerging community included a volunteer army of editors, who helped to keep the content aligned with Wikipedia's rules, the first version of which Sanger cerated in 2002. As the project grew, vandilization and dilution of the encyclopedia's content became more difficult to adress. The site's software keeps a log of every modification to every page, and this tracking system has been used to bust some high-profile offenders.&quot; (Fletcher). This means that there are enough vandalizers of Wikipedia that some of them even need to be kept on a tight leash. Such an example of such poisonous content would be an Irish student hoazing the world's media with a fake quote (Pogatchnik). This student was specifically attempting to see how information was received and interpreted, valid or not, in an age of instant news. He put words in the mouth of a then recently deceased composer on Wikipedia. Before Wikipedia could take care of the fake quote, journalists and blogs had already copy-pasted it to thee world (Pogatchnik).]]>

An example of misinformation is in Source #5 when students asserted on an exam that the jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-century Japan. The teacher knew this was wrong but found out that all his students wrote this on their exams because it was information from a wikipedia article. Another example is source #4 where someone edited a wikipedia article of a dead actor to add a quote which later newspapers used the faked edited quotes at the start or finish of their obituaries.]]>

Since its open to the public and allowed to be edited by anyone the chance of this happening is not low. Also we try to dodge what people say bad things we must also steer clear from the wrong information. People add info that may sound correct but is clearly wrong. For example you could be studying a wiki and on the test get all the information wrong because the wiki was just incorrect. Its kinda like sparknotes. Reading about how wikipedia is expensive boggles my mind. This is becasue people are allowed to add whatever they want. Espically incorrect information. Why would a company want to pay for a website that doesnt benefit someone if it has wrong information or even pay for something that they dont have all control of. False information gets spread so quickly. Its hard to understand the purpose of this because its always have something going wrong. Knowing you're looking for information that isnt correct just doesnt make sense to me. These sources explain why this website isnt 100% trustable. I wouldn't want to be on a website where I knew all my information wasnt correct.]]>

One was the lack of fixed formula for determining what should and shouldnt be included in a encyclopedia unconstrained by physical limitatations. Which means the site would now be montitoring to make sure that articles published by High Profile Offenders would no longer be allowed on the site so that its not spread quickly and people are not satisfied with the information being provided by wikipedia. Also in source #3 it explains how some of the articles published on their website had found some key points , but they were also quite dense, meaning they lacked of clarity.

Though vague, the speed in which it was seen, retrieved, and published by the media was nonetheless at an exponential rate. First off, it was also pointed out that the quote was rermoved from Wikipedia three times within minutes or hours, but the fact that, if it was indeed a few minutes, the media was able to grasp that quote within that short of a timespan and didn't bother checking out whether it was a fact or not proves that the information on Wikipedia can go viral at any given second, albeit real or fake. Also, Source #2 talks about how large of a page count Wikipedia has; &quot;...more than 13 million articles in 271 different languages&quot; (Fletcher). In addition, it also states that there were &quot;...more than 100 billion pages views...&quot; which also counts for the amount of traffic Wikipedia gets. As a result, what is stated in Source #3, solid key points but vague explainations, can ultimately lead to somewhat correct information, but become misinterpretted by a group of people which eventually takes that information as a fact and continues to spread it until it becomes a large misconception.]]>

Journalists and reseachers use this source of information because they think it's acurate. Errors aren't corrected frequently before the information leaks to other sources. The fake quote created by Professor Fitzgerald, hasn't been corrected and had spread to websites in Britain,Austriallia and India(Source #4). Another example of people using wikipedia and how it promoted the spread of misinformation is when students in a Japanese history class statyed that &quot;The Jesuits supported the Shimabara rebellion&quot;(Source #5). This shows that Wikipedia isn't a responsible source and isn't vetted thoroughly.]]>

In this article, he posted a fake quote from Maurice Jarre just hours after he died. Wikipedia soon found the quotes &quot;lack of attribution&quot; and got rid of it, but even so, journalists and many blogs were allready able to copy and paste it. Even big scale news blogs, and newspapers even accepted the quote as fact, even though it had no sources.

In source #4, the newspaper describes the story about a student who purposely put false information in a popular Wikipedia article to see if it would be edited or noticed. The information was actually published in newspaper articles about the subject, and the student notified Wikipedia to say it was false. False information can spread quickly because sources are not often evaluated before the content of them is used. In another article, false information was also spread quickly. &quot;The obscure, though incorrect, information was from Wikipedia, the collaborative online encyclopedia, and the students had picked it up cramming for his exam.&quot; (Source #5). The fact that a Wikipedia article is the first thing that pops up when someone types in a subject into google is a reason why misinformation can spread so fast. The students mentioned in source 5 weren't trying to use false information, they didn't know any better because Wikipedia is a popular internet site that contained much information on the study subject.]]>

This may happen due to the idea of how social media is becoming more dependent and addicitive for users. As a result, the users tend to believe everything they read on the Internet thinking it is reliable and accurate. In addition, Wikipedia is deemed as an inaccurate tool for research. This can be seen in Neil Waters' Japanese history class at Middlebury College, Vermont, when he noticed that his students were providing incorrect information on his exam (Source 5). The source was traced back to Wikipedia (Source 5).]]>

And not long after, people had believed what was said. They didn't question it, they didn't look for supporting evidence that the statement could be true, they just allowed themselves to believe what they thought was possibly true. &quot;A full month went by and nobody noticed the editorial fraud.&quot; Even though it was an expiriment, nobody had made an attempt to find back up of what was said. The creator of the fraud statement had said in an in interview that it was an expiriment, and about a week after, a newspaper in Britain had been the first to admit that they had gotten information straight from Wikipedia. So not only can misinformation be spread throughout the world by people believing it, but because people hadn't made any effort to look for more evidence. Some people may have just wanted a story to write in a paper, some may have just wanted something to talk about, and some may have just believed it because they heard it from someone.]]>

One of the biggest reasons is because it is online and stuff that goes on the internet spreads faster than wildfire. As it is shown on the chart in article 1, more and more people are starting to use the internet, so it would cause an increase in the spread of wikipedia users. Information that is on wikipedia would also spread very quickly because of how many different languages it is in. It's not just because of these things that wikipedia is spreading, it is also because of how easy it is to post an article on wikipedia or to just look at an article on wikipedia.

In this article, a student by the name of Shane Fitzgerald posted a quote on a Wikipedia page. The page was for the recently, at the time, passed away Maurice Jarre, who had won and Oscar for composing three times. Fitzgerald posted a false quote that he thought of himself. Then several obituarist used the quote in an obituary, without checking to see if Jarre actually said it. This is misinformation that is spreading to anyone who reads the obituary. The obituarist didn't check to see if the information was correct, and now it's spreading. Another source that demonstrates misinformation spreading quickly is source #5. In this source, students use false information from Wikipedia for answers on a test. The information the students got was that &quot;the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-century Japan.&quot; This information is incorrect. The professor knew that the correct information they needed was that there were very few Jesuits in Japan. The ones in Japan were in hiding, and they were in &quot;no position to aid a revolution.&quot; This misinformation can make students put down incorrect answers on their tests. Many students may use the same article on a test they are taking. So they would also be getting the false information.]]>

For an example in source five it states &quot;The obscure, though incorrect information was from wikipedia, the collaborative online encyclopeda, and the students had picked it up cramming for his exam&quot;. This example shows how the wikipedia website is not accurate at all how it can not be a reliable source. It also shows how if other people use they can get all of the wrong answers. Another example of showing how wikipedia give misinformation is in source two paragraph four when it states &quot;But since its inception, the biggest issue dogging Wikipedia has been concerns about its accuracy&quot;. This statement shows how wikipedia can not be trusted, or it gives off wrong information. Also why would someone want to use worng or information that is not resoureful at all. These sources throughout the passage show how unreliable wikipedia is as a informing website. Would you use a website that is not truthful or helpful with it sources?]]>

In source 4, the author was talking about Shane Fitzgerald's experiment with Wikipedia. She made quotes and information and saw that many used these false information was used in many blogs and articles. As shown in source 4, a simple falsified information can have rampant effect that can give many places inaccurate informations. The reason for this is shown in source 2. First, the budget for the program is exorbitant. WIkipedia requires around 6 million dollars per year and since Wikipedia refuses to use advertisements, it relies heavily on donations. Despite the large amounts of volunteers in correcting the website, it has a relatively small resource to work with considering it is run by only donations. This sparse resource makes it harder for editors to find mistakes and problems among the million articles that they have. Second reason for the quick spread of misinformation is the amount of users of WIkipedia. In source 3, it shows that more than 10 million users use Wikipedia. Source 5 states that the use of Wikipedia is so prevalent, banning it would be like saying to the whole populace not to listen to rock and roll. Both sources shows that Wikipedia is widely use and thus many people access the articles. If there is a single mistake, millions of users will read that information and take it for a fact not knowing that the information is wrong. With its sparse resource and the number of users, it is easy for a misinformation to spread very quickly.]]>

Dan Fletcher of TIME magazine, said that &quot;as [Wikipedia] grew, vandalization and dilution of the encyclopedia's content became more difficult to address (Source #2).&quot; The second reason why misinformation spreads so quickly on Wikipedia, is that media outlets and journalists are using the information on Wikipedia without double-checking their information. An Irish student named Shane Fitzgerald fabricated a quote from Maurice Jarre and put it on Wikipedia right after Jarre's death. Fitzgerald then found that a number of news outlets were using the fictional quote in thier articles. He claims that know one would've found out if he never notified anyone about it (Source #4).]]>

Irish student Shane Fitzgerald posted a fake quote on wikipedia for a French composer named Maurice Jarre that passed away recently, and many journalists used the same made up quote in many U.S blogs and newspaper articles, before wikipedia had the chance to even remove it. (Source 4.) This show how fast wrong information can get across. Another instance was a few students at Middlebury college,Vermont in a history class. A lot of them were using wikipedia as a resource, and they incorrectly responded on their exams that the &quot;Jesuits supported the Smabara Rebellion.&quot; The professor immediately noticed that there was something wrong with that information and found out the students had been using incorrect information from wikipedia.

They can both make a rucus in the world and spread like a wild fire. False acusations can create a stirr in the world like the quote of an Irish student, Shane Fitzgerald had made for a dead British triple oscare award -winnig composer(Source #4). The media went crazy with the quote that it was used in TV shows, newspaper articles and websites. Then discovered later on that it was fake. False information can cause dissasters when you use them. Like the students at Middlebury College, Vermount were writing reports on false information they got from Wikipedia(Source #5). The students then were banned of using the website for citing as sources in their school reports.]]>

Media outlets greatly influence the public and are capable of spreading information quickly, so if they choose to use Wikipedia because of its accessibility, they may spread misinformation quickly. &quot;Wikipedia on an academic hit list&quot; suggests that college students may choose to use Wikipedia when cramming for exams. Just like the media outlets, these students are under pressure to gather information quickly. Wikipedia is easily accessible to college students so its misinformation can spread quickly when college students are trying to gather information quickly. &quot;Wikipedia on an academic hit list&quot; also states that Wikipedia can be hard to avoid as it appears frequently when one uses search engines. A lot of the time it's conveniently placed towards the top of the list and with its gloriously compiled information is tempting to access. This level of accessibility makes misinformation on Wikipedia readily sporadic.]]>

We never can be sure what we see on thte internet is true. alot of the tthings said could be wrong. If you dont do a lot of research and just pick the forst one you see theres a fifty percent chance that it i could be right, but it could also be fifty percent wrong. All the cites you lok have information whether its about what you need or not. However technology is improving so ots gets easier to use the information you find. If it's the wrong information it could hurt your chances of getting something right. Since Wikipedia isnt always right you may want to look at other sources to see of they match, are little bit different, or dont match at all. Alot of people can copyright information and be fine becasue most people dont care to check. However some people are ok using the information if it is fair use and not trying to make arpofti or something out of it.]]>

An example of such an incident is the hoax done by an Irish student. After the student, Shane Fitzgerald, posted a fake quote on the Wikipedia page of a French composer soon after her death, it went viral. Even though Wikipedia quickly found the quote and revomed it, the quote was still out there in the news. After the media had failed to see that the quote was a phony, Shane sent them an e-mail, and the media hurried to begin the corrections. (Source #4) Another example of this is when students use Wikipedia to write papers. There is always the chance of your information being wrong. This happened to Neil Waters when he was over looking a test his students had done. He searched for the source of the misimformation and soon found it. It turned out that many of the students had used Wikipedia when they where studing and had all read the same misimformation. Neil decided that it was time to put a foot down. He would no longer let students site Wikipedia on papers or use it, and sites like it, as an escape for errors. The co-founder of Wikipedia said that he didn't think it was a negative thing. He said that students shouldn't site Wikipedia or sites like it and to double check their information. (Source #5)]]>

To give an example of an intentional spree of misinformation, there was an Irish student who hoaxed the world's media with a fake quote (Source 4). Through his fooling of the world's media, he indeed fooled the rest of the world. Misinformation from Wikipedia has also effected half a dozen students in Neil Waters' Japanese history class at Middlebury College, Vermont, in which the students were fooled into believing that the Jesuits were in &quot;no position to aid a revolution&quot;. (Source 5).]]>

Perhaps they might want to add that Michael Jackson actually faked his death and has released a new album. According to Source #4 and #5, students are pretty gullible and would probably believe it. Journalists are even more so; any bit of dirt they can get their greedy hands on sits pretty well with them. Angelina had an affair and Brad shot the guy? Potential gossip. Although Wikipedia has some fairly reliable information, one would have to be an idiot to write their whole essay based off it, at least use About.com. Maybe Yahoo.]]>

After all, it's created by users, not traditional 'experts.'&quot; I fully agree with Tami because she has a very valid point! As a child, our teachers always told us to never use Wiki because anyone can post on it! Over time Wiki has developed so maybe more expert type people have been posting information and correcting other peoples mistakes. Shane Fitzgerald a student at Dublin university posted a fake quote on the Wikipedia site to see how the public would respond. The administrators on Wiki saw that the quote was fabricated and quickly removed it. The Administrators didn't take it down quick enough to keep some journalists from cutting and pasting it first. (SOURCE 5 Information by: The Taipei Times). This is a perfect example of how this site may not be fully reliable becasue people are posting things that aren't exactly true. On the other hand there are people behind Wiki that are taking things that aren't true or accurate.]]>

If someone is looking up information about a topic and the article is not accuratley written, anyone else who looks up that topic will be reading false information. 42% of those Wikipedia users can be given false information any second on Wikipedia and not even know it. An example of false information given out to the world would be in the article posted by Shawn Pogatchink, &quot;Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote&quot;. In this article an Irish student at Dublin university tricked the world into thinking that Maurice Jarre said something that he actually didn't. Shane Fitzgerald posted a false quote on Wikipedia hours after Jarre's death. The whole world then began to believe the quote even though it was false. This is a perfect example how misinformation posted on Wikipedia can spread quickly]]>

If the Journalists go to Wikipedia for answers or info about anything and they find something shocking or something that may catch the readers attention they will publish it, without a second thought. They want to be the first to get that bit of info out to the world, before anybody else does. For example &quot; The Guardian&quot; was first to admit that they used the false information of Wikipedia, without a double checking to see if it had a source, or to stop and think about it. Fitzgeralds experiment proved that if he hadn't told Wikipedia that there was false information on one of the articles the probably wouldn't have noticed. After Jay Walsh found out he appreciated what Fitzgerald had done, and he agreed to what his point was. He too was taken by suprise that how quickly journalists would read imformation off Wikipedia and automatically think its true.]]>

Sometimes information found on Wikipedia is not true and false information can spread quickly. Shane Fitzgerald posted a quote on Wikipedia that said ,&quot; Wikipedia passed. Journalism flunked&quot;. The student only wanted to try this experiment and see what the effect of something like this would be. Newspapers around the world including Britain, Australia and India, used this quote to write their newspapers articles. After a month the student sent e-mails to media outlets explainig what had happened. Only one publication, The Guardian has been the only publication to apoligize. (Pogatchnik) Something similar happened at Middlebury College. When about 12 students in Neil Waters' Japanese history class answered on a test that the Jesuits had supported the Shimabara Rebellion in the 17th century in Japan, the proffesor knew that something had to be wrong. The problem was that the students had used information from Wikipedia, and this information was wrong.Right after this, Wikipedia was banned to be used as a source at the colege.(Cohen) Pogatchnik, Shawn. &quot; Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media With Fake Quote&quot; Cohen, Noam &quot;Wikipedia on an Academic Hit List&quot;]]>

The news spread fast from this false quote, with journalists not even verifying that this was true. They jumped to it and wrote articles about it the first chance they got. This shows how fast false words can travel and make their way into everyones life, even if the site had taken it down very quickly, it wasn't quick enough to take down before people saw it and clipped it. Source #5 states that a Japanese teacher found a problem from a Wikipedia article from students studying for a test in his class. The students had cited Wikipedia and done poorly on the exam, therefore showing that there was false information being read on the Wikipedia page. Though measures were taken to prevent this from happening again, you can't really ban a website from being used from a body of students. The information the students were using spread quckly just like the false information the Irish student put on a Wikipedia page. The information on the internet travels widely and quickly, thus explaining the spread of misinformation.]]>

Because people are more trusting of the website, it can lead to false information being published. A student at Dublin univeristity purposley posted a false quote from Maurice Jarre, who had recently died. In a matter of hours the quote was plastered all over news articles and obituaries. It was not however, on Wikipedia, soon after the quote was posted administrators removed the quote for lack of authenticity. Jornalists however continued to use the quote.(4) While this spreading of false information was mainly the result of inattentive journalists and not Wikipedia, sometimes Wikipedia is to blame. Many students, especially in college and highschool use Wikipedia as a source for cramming before a test, and this can sometimes get them in a hard place. More then six students at Middlebury College had put false information on a history test, information they had found on Wikipedia(5). While Wikipedia is a great source of information, people are forgetting that it's not written by experts. It's a great place to find information, but the information should be found somewhere else also.]]>

The misinformation in Wikipedia can spread quickly due to the number of users that trust it. A study done by an Irish student by the name of Shane Fitzgerald showed that a number of news outlets use wikipedia for information. His study was simple, he put a fake quote in a Wikipedia page and waited to watch it spread. The quote spread rapidly throughout the world and many news organizations were shamed to be found so gullible (4). Another incedent of misinformation happened in a history class located at Middlebury College in Vermont. A professor noticed a mistake that was being commonly made on a test. Further inquiry into it showed that his students had used Wikipedia to find information but they had not checked the accuracy of the article. A volenteer author for Wikipedia had made a small mistake that showed just how unreliable Wikipedia could be if it were totally depended on. This led to the college not accepting Wikipedia as a valid source for a citation (5).]]>

Ariticle two has some discustion over how there are always people who are trying to vandalise Wikipedia, and it even explains how regardless of how hard the Wiki editors try to prevent and remove all the vandalisum performed on their website, they won't be able to imediatly get to fixing every single thing, in other words, it can take a long time for one faulse statement to be removed because wiki is already trying to remove several other false statments and it might take a long time for them to get to that one other faulse statment.]]>

Many journalists can find and even publish false information about someone or something if the information is found on Wikipedia. Source 4 speaks of an experiment where false information was posted to a Wikipedia page to see how quickly it would be taken down. According to source 4, the quote wasn't taken down until the person that put it there spoke up, and by that time journalists had already used the false information he had put out there. Another way Wikipedia's misinformation can spread quickly is by it's popularity with students. According to source 5, students often, if not all the time, reference Wikipedia when confronted with research or a project. According to a teacher though, studetns were turning in reports with false information on them with Wikipedia listed as a source. This experience explained by source 5 shows how quickly and prevalently Wikipedia's false information can spread by students.]]>

For example, in his article, &quot;Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote,&quot; Shawn Pogatchnik discusses how as and experiment, a student was able to spread false information about a deceased composer by posting it on Wikipedia soon after the composer's death. The experiment was designed to test the student's hypothesis that, &quot;...under pressure to produce news instantly, media outlets were increasingly relying on Internet sources--none more ubiquitous than the publicly edited Wikipedia.&quot; This proved to be true as the false information was published by hasty journalists in newspapers and blogs. Another example of this can be found in, &quot;Wikipedia on an academic hit list,&quot; by Noam Cohen. Cohen describes how students in a hurry to find information to study for their exam led them to trusting false information on Wikipedia. he says, &quot;The obscure, though incorrect, information was from Wikipedia, the collaborative online encyclopedia, and teh students had picked it up cramming for his exam.&quot; Because the students were in such a rush to study, they trusted false information.]]>

As soon as anything is posted on the internet, people assume that it is true (Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media With Fake Quote). Source #5 states that there was misinformation on Wikipedia about &quot;the Jesuits supporting the Shimabara Rebellion in the 17th-century Japan&quot; but this is incorrect. Teachers realized that students started to cite Wikipedia in their papars and that the information was not always true. (Wikipedia on an academic hit list).]]>

A lot of colleges and newspapers would blame the site for the wrong information that they put out there or students getting test answers wrong because of citing the web page. Anyone can make their own page of false information. An Irish student posted his own false quote of a famous composer that had recently died. The inspiring quote was put in tons of newspapers and blogs. He had put this quote in Wikipedia to show how news can travel fast, and even false news. Many students failed a test in Neil Walters' Japanese history class and he noticed the students cited Wikipedia. Noticing the similarities in the cited Wikipedia he went to look and seen that the Wikipedia cite has false information. There was only one news paper that said sorry to Shane Fitzgerald for taking the quote and didnt do enough research to relate the quote to a rea; source. Other newspappers didnt seem so sorry, the didnt lke that Shane gave false information to be put out their. Colleges are now resticting how much student can use Wikipedia. -Source #4 &quot;Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media With Fake Quote&quot; by Shawn Pogetchnik -Source #5 &quot;Wikipedia on an academic hit list&quot; by Noam Cohen]]>

He cleverly did this right after hearing about a death of a famous man. Knowing that the death would make newspapers desperate to get information on the man fast, he put in a quote by him. Sure enough, many newspapers did publish his foux quote. Another reason that false information could be used is that sometimes people post things that aren't &quot;neutral&quot;. This has been shown in source number two.

Anyone can contribute information, a nonscholar or scholar alike, making it a very large task to weed out the poorly cited, false information from the truthful. Though a tast force of 100's is assigned to correcting and deleting biased, false information, a few mistakes can slip by. As exampled in &quot;Wikipedia on an academic hit list&quot;, a college class was able to prove a mistake in the writings of an article about the Shimabara Rebellion. Though the students knew better, a learning, oblivious user would have no idea about the misinformation. This is a faulty detail to Wikipedia and user-discretion must then be applied heavily. Along with misinformation that can easily be proved wrong, often details,quotes and other easy mishandeled information can be put up by the writers of Wikipedia. Shane Fitzgerald proved this when he made up a quote on a newly desist composer (source 4). Though Wikipedia soon removed the information, there was enough time for people to read it and believe its invalidty. This creates a whole different problem because a twist in information can be left forever and become a part of history even if it was completely false to begin with. The fact that in both situations the spread of misinformation was very fast or not even caught is a major problem with Wikipedia and its use.]]>

Most people believe that the wrong information will get changed before is can do any harm. However, this has been proven to be wrong. A Dublin University student posted a fake quote on a page of someone who had recently died, not to make someone else believe that it was true, but to see if Wikipedia would really change it before many people could see it (Source 4). Come to find out, Wikipedia never did change it, and when the information got into the hands of a journalist, it spread like wildfire (Source 4). Neil Waters had a history Class at Middlebury College, Vermont where half a doze students wrote the same, wrong information on an exam, and he tracked it back to Wikipedia (Source 5). In a classroom enviroment, some kids will beleive anything just to be able to have an answer on the paper or have one more piece of information. It is very easy for information to be spread, and if it is wrong, then everyone has the wrong facts.]]>

Another example is when half a dozen students in Neil Waters' Japanese history class at Middlebury Collage, Vermont, asserted on exams that the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-century Japan and knew that something was wrong (Source #5). With it, some people can see that its not as reliable source when getting the right information for a subject but sence its a encyclopedia source, its in a way more trusted to be accurate than it misinforming.]]>

It doesn't matter what quality is kept on the internet, there will be someone out there who will accept it. Misinformation is no exception, it will spread just as fast as anything else put on the internet unless heavily countered. Wikipedia being an open website where many average people may edit the information of many articles it asking for vandalism and misinformation. Source #4 with Fitzgerald for instance, fooled world media with a false quote. This test revealed how heavily reliant Media researchers are on the internet, and specifically Wikipedia. These researchers want quick information to report on an event first before any competition can reach the same goal, so often quality can be overlooked. In this case a false quote lands many Media outlets in hot water, one of them being the British Guardian which appologizes for it's mistake, and many others who blame Fitzgerald for their shoddy research. &quot;Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media with Fake Quote&quot; by Shawn Phatchnik.

A studant from Dublin University said, &quot; I am 10-percent convinced that if i hadn't come forward, that qoute would have gone done in history as something that Maurice Jarre said, instead of something that I made up.&quot; (#4) Something like just changing a small qoute can affect an entire research paper and even history, and from this college studants expierment it can be done on the website of Wikipedia. Now when other people are writing something and taking information off of Wikipedia, and they hand it to someone who knows the information first hand then it becomes a problom. That is what happen to a professor in a history department at a Middlebury College. His studants took information off of Wikiepdia and used it in a paper. The professor know that the information was wrong and say that the looked the information up online. He took this and went tot the co-founder of Wikiepdia, and they simply told them that they shouldn't be using Wikepedia as encyclopedias, or citing them as them either.

Because Wikipedia allows for people to publish anything on the website, it is easy for someone to post something that is untrue and for that false information to spread quickly. In the same article, Fitzgerald did some research and found that media were increasingly relying on the Internet and Wikipedia as a source for news. By using Wikipedia as a source for their news, they could not verify if the information they were publishing were actuall true and thus could result in false information being spread rapidly. In addition the increasing use of Wikipedia can contribute to false information spreading quickly. According to Source 1, there was a 17% increase in users in a 3 year period. Just the increase in the number of people using the website can result in false information spreading like a wildfire.]]>

People are always looking up something whether it be an actor's name from a movie they recently watched, a recipe for a new dish, or even a quote from a famous person who died. In this case, the first thing someone finds on whatever they may be looking up is most likely what they are going to believe. In Source #4 a student from Dublin University posted a fake quote to a French composer's Wikipedia page only hours after his death. This fake quote had been used on dozens of U.S. blogs and newspaper websites in Britain, Australia, and India. Without the editors of these even thinking, they quickly used this fake quote in the obituaries they had written. Soon they had found out that this quote had not been said by Jarre himself but in fact made up by a student just to test how media would handle it. In Source #2 it talks about how Wikipedia's writing is clunky or prome to bias and that the authors focus on pet projects. The site is used more for interesting things rather than history or things that may actually matter and not just hobbies. So with millions of people adding their input, it may not always be correct. The people who edit this site cannot always catch the vandalizing and dilution of the encyclopedia's content. Thus, not everything you read is always true.]]>

As a result of Jarre's death many media outlets wanted to quote Jarre and found an easy way to do so by cutting and pasting Fitzgerald's made up quote.The mistake would have gone unnoticed by the media outlets if Fitzgerald had not come forward and told them the truth. Another time when misinformation posted on Wikipedia spread quickly was in Source #5. In this article half a dozen students asserted a wrong fact on an exam because they had used WIkipedia as a study tool.

When looking into the influence of the internet on media reports, Irish student Shane Fitzgerald found &quot;a golden opportunity&quot; to expose the too-easily fooled media reporters for their lack of adequate research (4). The death of a famous composer led the student to enter a made-up quote onto the composer's biographical Wikipedia article (4). The flood of media flocking to online sources to quickly come up with an article on the compser's death was too easily tricked by the insertion of false information, and they quickly proceeded to report the quote as one of the late composer's very own (4). Misinformation stemming from a rush to make the day's paper is not the only source of false reporting. Students in a Japenese history college course reported on an event in history that never actually occurred (5). The late cram sessions that the students consulted Wikipedia in resulted in students learning false information (5). This occurs due to the students waiting until the last minute to prepare and rushing to learn information that should be verified with other information.]]>

In source 4 it mentions that Dublin university student Shane Fitzgerald took not even 14 minutes to post an opinion on the site that could be misleading. So sure people could post their own views and ideals on the site and make others view the topic in a prejudiced way.]]>

The web-site has a number of editors and volutenteer writers that aren't &quot;experts&quot; when it comes to history and other articles. They are just great writters who voulenteered to write and perfect the articles, which they have no idea about.This was proven in Wikipedia on an academic hit list in Source #5 when the Middlebury history department notified students that Wikipedia was not a correct source to base their research on. In reality, anyone can write inaccurarte information about something on an article and it would go unnoticed. This has been seen in Source #4 where Shaen Pogatchnik wrote about a student at Dublin university named Shane Fitzgerald, who wrote a quote on Wikipedia to see if it would be overlooked. He confessed to reporters that the quote had been made up by himself and was not a quote said by Maurice Jarre. Even the free online ecyclopedia quickly caught the mistake and corrected it but by then the newspapers had already reported it. In A Brief History Of Wikipedia, the article shows that the mistakes of Wikipedia is 3.86 compared to the Encyclopedia Britannica's mistakes of 2.92. Overall the only thing that Wikipedia does seem to be accuarte is when it comes to cancer. Besides that, Wikipedia can be an unrealiable source for student and others doing research. The inaccuary seen on Wikipedia can spread faster than an eagle spreading its wings.]]>

In source four, Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote. Shane Fitzgerald posted a quote that was very poetic but phony at the same time on Wikipedia to test on medias upholding accuracy and accountability. In short terms, Wikipedia passed and Journalism failed. After the quote, &quot;One could say life itself has been one long soundtrack, Music was my life, music brought me to life, and music is how i will be remembered long after I leave this life. When I die there will be a final waltz playing in my head that only I can hear&quot;, was posted it was immediatly taken down but it was up there long enough for Journalist to see and put it in there entree. Weeks later Shane told all the newspaper writers and Journalist who used his quote what he did. To this day only one publication has admitted to this flaw. In source five it tells us how students failed a test because they used wikipedia as a source. Neil Waters couldnt figure it out on why half his class had put the same wrong answers to his test, finally he realized why exactly that happened. He found out that they all used Wikipedia as a source. Because of this mishap they decided to ban using Wikipedia as a source at Middlebury College.]]>

Fitzgerald expected newspapers to avoid the quote because it had no link to a source, but many blogs and newspapers used the quote in their obituaries for Maurice Jarre. In Source #5, six students in a Japanese history class stated in their exams that Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion. In reality, the Jesuits had no interest in aiding a revolution.

Another example of how fast Wikipedia information can be spread is in source #5 where a Japanaese history class all the put the same wroing answer, their professor, Neil Waters, found out why they all put the wrong answer and it was because of Wikipedia.

As said in Source #4, Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote by Shawn Pogatchnik, it took a young student named Fitzgerald less than 15 minutes to fabricate a quote about a famous music composer Jarre and post it on Wikipedia. Although the quote did get deleted, many journalists and writers already found it, and began to use it in their writings and obituaries for the passed music composer. In Source #5, Wikipedia on an academic hit list by Noam Cohen, he tells us how students rely on Wikipedia for information, although the information may be false. Once one student finds the answer to their question on Wikipedia, other students will. For example the students in Neil Waters Japanese history class at Middlebury College, Vermont all put on their exams that the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in the 17th-century when in fact they did not, but found their answer on Wikipedia, which was wrong.]]>

It is expected that journalist know enough not to publish material without through research, but this quote managed to appear in articles several days later. This demonstrates the blind trust given to a website even when knowing of its shortcomings. A similar case occured in a Japanese History calss when students asserted on their exams that Jesuits played a major role in the Shimbara rebellion , even though this was completely false.

One student was able to contribute a false quote to an article on Maurice Jarre that seemed to be true was used by media in obituaries for the dead French musicain. This type of misinformation can become a domino effect as one website uses it then it ends up on another and another and soon it can become real. &quot;It would have become another example where, once anything is printed enough times in the media without challenge, it becomes fact.&quot; Says Fitzgerald, the mastermind behind the false quote. As the internet becomes a bigger source for many student's research and studying techniques, Wikipedia will also. As explored by Noam Cohen, in &quot;Wikipedia on an academic hit list&quot; many students will pick up false information off of this popular informative site and take it as word. Neil Waters expresses his distaste as many of his students have been getting this false information off of Wikipedia and applying it in the classroom. As many students actually make up work to publish on Wikipedia who is to say that this is all true? While Wikipedia has filters and something completely obscene and unrealistic could never make it through these filters, who is to say that one person couldn't throw in a small change in the truth like Shane Fitzgerald did?]]>

This is clearly evident in Source 4 where the media uses a fake quote in the obituary of a dead composer. Shane Fitzgerald expresses his concern that &quot;under pressure to produce news instantly, media outlets were increasingly relying on Internet sources - none more ubiquitous than the publicly edited Wikipedia&quot; (Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote). These news outlets used a random quote wihout checking where it came from. They did not consider that Wikipedia articles are &quot;written by volunteers and subject to mistakes and sometimes falsehoods'' (Wikipedia on an academic hit list). Wikipedia is generally very accurate and quick to correct blatant vandalism, but it is not perfect. So on a site of Wikipedia's size, an error can quickly be spread if the users are not careful.]]>

In source 4 an Irish student was learnig in class about how fast media travels around the world, so he put a fake quote on Wikipedia to see if it would spread and how fast. It spread pretty quickly and globally. Several newpapers, journalists, and bloggers used this fake quote in their arbituarys. In source 5 students were studying for a history exam and decided to use Wikipedia. Turns out the information was wrong. It could be that the person who wrote the Wikipedia article purposely wrote the wrong information or he thought that the information was right and was going to share it with others. Either way the students in a Japanese history class at Middlebury college got the wrong information and it cost them. It is very easy to be misinformed from Wikipedia.]]>

For example, in source 4; it talked about a person who spent more than 15 minutes fabricating a obituary about someone's actual life. Another reason is that for academic standards; some students rely on Wikipedia to help them better at school (Source #5). However, if students rely more on Wikipedia than anything else on the internet, then they risk the chance of lowering their grades and scores since everything on Wikipedia can be revised and edited to make it sound not entirely true.]]>

Its organization makes finding information easy, and every visit to the site, no matter what you are searching for, is the same.

There are countless examples of these memes and of misinformation in particular spreading throughout the public, Source #4 mentions a situation that arose when a university student in Dublin posted a fake quote on Wikipedia on Maurice Jarre's page, immediately after the famous musician died, in order to test the media in regards to its accuracy. The quote was tailor-made for obituaries, and journalists jumped at the opportunity to use such a perfect line. The quote was widely claimed as being something Jarre actually said, and despite the facts that there was no primary source to back it up, and that administrators caught and removed the quote immediately, the damage had been done. The student called major news instutions and explained that the quote was a fake. Source #4 shows that certain people might use Wikipedia as a cop-out; it is a slough of easily available information that they do not have to put any real work in to access. Many use Wikipedia for this reason. Source #5 is a news story about a class of students enrolled in a Japanese history class at Middlebury College in Vermont. It explains a situation in which a number of students gave incorrect information on a test after using information obtained on Wikipedia to study. The frequency of this mistake was noticed, and when asked about why they used Wikipedia as a reliable source, the students stated that their high-school teachers had allowed it. This shows that Wikipedia is being widely accepted as a source that is accurate, adn those who use Wikipedia take the information presented there as the truth.]]>

Source #4 is about an Irish college student posting a fake quote on Wikipedia. This quote was written about a song writer that had recently died. The media found his quote and blew it up to an international scale. Soon obituaries all around the world had his fake quote plastered all over them. I believe this happened because the media was researching information for an obituary and a simple Google search led them to the Wikipedia page with the fake article. Bad information can spread fast over the internet. Acording to source #2 Wikipedia has grown by a very large margin since its founding in 2001. In addition the article declares that some research has been done as to the accuracy of Wikipedia. According to researchers there is an average of 3.86 errors per article on a Wikipedia page compared to a slightly better 2.92 errors per article on a page of the Encyclopedia Britannica. These number of errors per page in adition to the fact that Wikipedia shows up on top when it comes to searches of search engines helps to spread bad information extremely quickly all across the globe.]]>

In &quot;Wikipedia on an academic hit list&quot;, Cohen talks about how a history teacher discovered that boat load of inaccurate information that his students were citing and writing about. In the source, it focuses on the negative aspects of Wikipedia and how it shouldn't be used in an acedemic atmoshpere. &quot;[students] understand that Wikipedia is not a responsible source, that it hasn't been throughly vetted,&quot; says Keith Williams in source #5. Source #4 also talks about how Wikipedia is not a reliable source for inofrmation. It talks about how a man did a study and made up a quote that a powerful leader had said and put it on Wikipedia. Many people thought that the made up quote was the real deal and believed it. The man later came forward, proving that people believed what they read on Wikipedia. &quot;I am 100 percent convinced that if I hadn't come forward, that quote would have gone down in history as something Maurice Jarre said, instead of something I made up,&quot; says Shane Fitzgerald. As you can see, Wikipedia has its up sides but also has many down sides. Sources 4 and 5 are evidence that Wikipedia cannot be 100% trusted when it comes to accurate information.]]>

When comprehending that article i realized that this experiment of his was vandalism. He pasted a fake quote onto the article of Maurice Jarre. The French composer had recently passed away and it was all hyped up and in the news. So Shane Fitzgerald, the culprit behind this study, decided to take his &quot;golden opportunity.&quot; He stated it took him no less than 15 minutes to create the quote, but once he posted it &quot;a full month went by and nobody noticed the editorial fraud.&quot; There was an entire month of media sources cutting and pasting this quote, using it, praising the quote, and just out right overusing it. This was one occurance. The next major event was at Middlebury from Source #5. Middlebury had banned the use of citing this online encyclopedia. Which was &quot;a growing debate within journalism&quot; at Middlebury. Middlebury found this error in a page on the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th century Japan. &quot;over half a dozen students&quot; came in with a mistake on this paper, The obsucre information was from Wikipedia. &quot;The students had picked it up crammin for his exam.&quot; Wikipedia sometimes does not always contain the correct information but this does show you how infulential the site is. When a teacher assigns a test and over half a dozen kids used this site for cramming and used the wrong information. This is just a small town example, think about this test on large scale. Even globally how many people would just accept this information given to them.]]>

Vandalism was very coomon to Wikipedia.Anyone could go in and modify the information posted. If someone simply did not like the information, they could change it to whatever they please. Source #2 states that Wikipedia's are written by users and not experts on the subject. This could be why Wikipedia might be unreliable. The users writing the article could put false information, or could not fully understand the subject they are writing on causing information to be missing.The calrity to which the article was wriiten in could also be a problem. If someone could not understsand the information they are reading about, why bother? Explaining and going to grave detail could help Wikipedia become more understanding and reliable. In source #4, it explains how Fitzgerald hsoted an experiment where he added false information on Wikpedia and a month went by without anyone challenging that information. If no one even is questioning what Wikipedia is posting and if its true or not, why even bother to read it. Source #4 shows that once something is posted on the internet, no one ever questions it and its almost like it becomes a fact.Source #5 shows that students are belieinvg everything that Wikpedia posts, whether its true or not. Students failed a test because the information they learned from was wrong.Overall, Wikipedia's reliablilty is far from truthful. They have a long ways to go if they ever want to be known as knowing all the &quot;facts&quot;.]]>

Source #4 recaps a misinformation crisis plotted by Shane Fitzgerald. Later, after studying the event of media sources citing misinformation, Shane found that &quot;under pressure to produce news instantly, media outlets were increasingly relying on internet sources.&quot; This goes to show that a lot of the time, media outlets want to cite whats there already. Whats easiet to attain. What may be wrong in information. In addition, professor Waters at Middlebury College argues that students should not be citing Wikipedia for the reason of spreading misinformation. &quot;But the errors on the test last semester were the last straw.&quot; The mis-citing of sources should not spread quickly which is why Waters suggest that a &quot;total ban on Wikipedia would have been impractical, not to mention close-minded, because Wikipedia is too handy to expect students never consult it.]]>

There are many different websites through which this happens such as: Twitter, Facebook, and Wikipedia. Those are jsut some examples but in source 1, it says that there are more adults using the internet every year, and with that case, there will be more mislead information spreading. If someone hears something and its not true they can put in on the internet and cause many other people to believe it. In Source 2, it says that there are many different languages on Wikipedia, and since there are many different languages, many countries use this website. People tend to believe things they find on the internet these days and if someone from the United States posts something on Wikipedia, people in Germany or England might believe it.

Wikipedia has had a lot of criticism for this rapid spreading of false information. This could happen for a number of reasons. &quot;Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote&quot; explains how Wikipedia removed this false information, &quot;but not quickly enough to keep some journalists from cutting and pasting it first.&quot; Because people didn't double-check information, a fake quote spread very quickly to other types of journalism. This wasn't necessarily Wikipedia's fault though, considering that they removed the information; the reason it was spread was due to journalists' lack of research. &quot;Wikipedia, Past and Present&quot; also considers reasons for quickly spreading information. Between 2007 and 2010, Wikipedia users increased from 25% to 42%. So, if the number of people using and spreading information from Wikipedia is increasing, the misinformation increases as well.]]>
