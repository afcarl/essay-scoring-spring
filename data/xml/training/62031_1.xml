They reason the listed was that it was it was so far bigger that and European city. They had palaces, law courts, public baths, and markets. That is why Tenochtitlan is a highly developed city.]]>

Corn provided cornmeal pancakes, but today they are known as tortillas. All homes had sweat baths in the courtyard of their house.

For example, in source #2, it tells us that the Aztects had palaces, law courts, public baths, and even markets. The Aztects were advanced in buildings, they had temples resting upon a platform on top of pyramids. They even made tools and built their own matrials such as objects to transport very large and heavy objects like stone. This statement is also proved in the third soucre given. It expresses how wondrefull and beautiful their buildings were. It also tells how they used canals all throughout the city. The Aztects also had their own markets. They also kept their city very clean and organized. They had thousands of men making sure ther city stayed like this. As you can see Tenochtitlan was a very advanced and devoloped city.]]>

For example, they traded objects, they carried things on their own, they had very fancy archietecture, and they had palces to go to such as parks. This is why I think that the city of Tenchtitlan was a very high developed city.]]>

This shows that Tenochtitlan is a highly developed city because most cities, back in their time, didnt have causeways. Another example I thought related/supported this idea is source #2 (Technologhy in the Time of the Aztecs- Causeways, Bridges, Aqueducts). I think this supports the idea because their aqueducts brought fresh water into their city from the springs in the hills and in some places, the aqueducts opened out to form reservoirs.

They were made of stone and held up by wooden pillars that were made without iron or steel tools. There were also bridges made of wood which could be taken off to prevent enemies from getting in, as well as to let canoes get through. This shows that although the Aztecs didn't have metal tools, they managed to create a way to and from the mainland that could also protect them. They needed to be creative to do something like that. Source #2 and Source #3 The king of Tenochtitlan had a 10-mile dike built to keep a large source of fresh water in one place, untouched by salt water. The city's aqueducts brought water from there to the city. The acqueducts were stone with two clay pipes so that if one was being cleaned, the other would still bring water. This also shows that the Aztecs were clever enough to solve their problem of salty water and again do it without metal tools. They also had a steady source of fresh water for drinking and agriculture. Source #2 and Source #3]]>

This supports the idea of the Aztecs being highly developed, because it is difficult to learn how to turn these materials into usable tools that are for their advantage. Also, in &quot;The City of Tenochtitlan,&quot; by Robert Hull, it is mentioned that the city of Tenochtitlan was an unusually clean place, do to the fact that there were about a thousand men who swept and washed the streets every day.

They did not have carts with wheels, so they must have found ways to use sleds, levers, and ropes, or rollers made from tree trunks to hasul large blocks.&quot; As said in Source #1: Excerpt from Technology in the Time of the Aztecs, &quot;There were few streets in the city. Instead, the Aztecs built a regular grid of canals so that people could travel around the city and transport goods by boat. The Aztecs managed to build a highly developed civilization in just 200 years. The secret of their success was that they learned to use very simple tools with great skill.&quot; In Source #3: The City of Tenochtitlan, it saids, &quot;To keep the lake water around Tenochtitlan fresh, Texcocoan king Nezahaulcoyotl, built a 10 mile long dike. The Aztecs had no coins or money curency. Instead, certain objects were used as a means of exchange. These example supports that Tenochtitlan was a highly developed city by the ways they keep out enemies and allow canoes to go in. Using sleds or ropes to move large objects. Traveling by boat instead of walking and building with simple tools. Keeping the lake fresh longer and trading instead of using money.]]>

When Cotes and his soldiers arrived, they were amazed to find that Tenochtitlan was far bigger than any European city.More than 250,000 people lived there. There were palaces, law courts,public baths, and markets. Many houses were built on raised platforms to protect them from floods. Most were just one story high, because taller houde would have been to heavy to stand on the marshy ground.'' This detail show that the Aztecs were very civilized. source #2 is the second details is on ''The Aztecs built three wide causeways to connect Tenochtitlan to mainland. These were of stone, supported on wooden pillars. They built the causeways with gaps joined by wooden bridges that could be removed to allow canoes to pass through and to keep enemies out. Other wooden bridges over canals in the city were permanent. The example above is a good support because the city had canals that only canoes would fit through so they were thinking when they thought how are we going to defend are selves ow we can make a tunnel system that only canoes can fit through.]]>

On Source #1 it states, &quot;The Aztecs built a regular grid of canals so that people could travel around the city and tranport goods by boat.&quot; This is suggesting that the Aztecs were advanced enough to build a grid of canals. They used only simple tools, yet they were able to build canals and let people travel around the city with ease. It also let them transport goods by boat and is an example of industry of a modern civilization. On Source #2 it says, &quot;There were palaces, law courts, public baths, and markets. This shows many examples required for a modern civilization. There were law courts that were used for judging and was an example of government. It also says that there were markets that were used to sell goods and is a good example of industry. Today, we have markets too. There are many evidence in these sources that shows that Tenochtitlan was an advanced civilization.]]>

Tenochtitlan was highly developed in many ways. For example, in paragraph 9, the Aztecs in Tenochtitlan found out a way to trade without using money, and instead use items such as goose-quills filled with gold-dust. This led to amazingly busy and colorful markets in the city. The market created a place for the Aztecs to trade vegetables, clothes, and hardware which concluded in a huge development in Tenochtitlan. Also, in paragraph 4, it states the city was built around a network of canals. This made water transportation easy around the city. This means easier gardening, baths, and drinking water around the city. All in all, Tenochtitlan was a very highly developed city because they found a way to trade with items as currency and they made their city around a network of canals.]]>

Also, the article says that this Aztec city was very well orginized. The second source also gives information why Tenochtitlan was a highly developed city. One example is that there were palaces, law courts, public baths, and markets, which means that the city was developed enough to build all these foundations. Another example of how Tenochtitlan was a highly developed city was because they used many advanced building tools. In the article, it states that they used hammers, axes, copper blades, chisels, and scrapers. In addition, the articles tells me that they used volcanic rock, obsidian, and pumice instead of regular rock to make their tools because these rocks are more harder and stronger, which is interesting because they were developed enough to come up with a better option for making better tools.]]>

This came from source number two. This supports the claim because building temples on pyramids are very important to civilization and the causeways are connecting their city to main land.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Tenochtitlan, as stated in all sources of reading, was a highly developed city for its time. One example of this, stated in Source #1 (Technology in the Time of the Aztecs), indcates the advanced canal system in the city. The author states, &quot;Tenochtitlan was linked to the mainland by three raised roads, or causeways. There were few streets in the city. Instead, the Aztecs built a regular grid of canals so that people could travel around the city and transport goods by boat.&quot; This example explains the Aztec's means of transportation. Now, if the reader analyzes this piece of information, they will have made an inference as to how efficient this was compared to other ways of transportation. This canal system, unlike other &quot;roads&quot; in a variety of cities, was more effiecient, faster, and even provided access to other parts of the town. Another piece of evidence that pertains towards the highly developed concept of the city can be found in Source #3 (The City of Tenochtitlan). In the text, the author states, &quot;As the island city in the lake grew, food was needed for more and more people. Rocks and soil were brought by canoe from the mainland, to make more chinampas. On these chinampas, and on the fields around the lake, the Aztecs grew corn, beans, squash, chili peppers, tomatoes, and amaranth. People even built cane and thatch houses on their floating gardens.&quot; In this particular piece of evidence, the author highlights Tenochtitlan's experienced ways of agriculture. This further indicates that Tenochtitlan was an advanced city for it's time, seeing as though it is highly developed in a variety of areas (Agriculture, etc.). These exerpts from the text also support the fact that the citizens of Tenochtitlan are well organized and effcient.]]>

Most were one story high, because taller houses would have been too heavy to stand on the marshy ground.&quot; Another piece of evidence I found is from the 3 source, &quot;The City of Tenochtitlan&quot; by Robert Hull, in the text it states that, &quot;In the valley, Tenochtitlan grew into one of the largest cities in the world. An island of only 7 sq. miles (18 sq ft. km), it had a population of at least 80,000 people-maybe even as many as 300,000&quot; As you can see, those are the two different pieces of evidence I foung from this source.]]>

The Tenochtitlan, had been developed enough, to figure out a way of which transportation could be safe, and &quot;easy to come by&quot; when to get to other certain places, and as the certain structures of this, could be surrported as even more saftey for the citizens in Tenochititlan. According to, &quot;Source #3&quot;, &quot;The lake had no outlet to the sea, so it could flood or become too salty. To keep the lake water around the Tenochtitlan fresh, the Texcocoan king Nezahaulcoyotl, built a 10 mile long dike.&quot;. The Tenochititlan would intelligent enough to be able to build this type of structure for others to know, that for example, would not get sick as from salty water and would know that floods could not come, if so to another section of the city. In conclusion, the Aztecs had been a highly developed city, in able to build certain buildings/stuctures in order for their civizalization to be in order.]]>

There were handsome buildings of carved stone and wood, courtyards brimming with flowers, and beautifully designed canals.&quot; The city was very impressive and well built and developed, therefore like it says, impressing many people. If it impresses many people it must be a very highly developed place. Also in source 2, it says, &quot;The Aztecs built three wide causeways to connect Tenochtitlan to the mainland. These were of stone, supported on wooden pillars. They built the causeways with gaps joined by wooden bridges that could be removed to allow canoes to pass through and to keep enemies out.&quot; This is a very complicated structure, yet the Aztecs sucessfully keep it in shape and built it. It is amazing and impressive how the Aztecs were so clever as to make this structure, therefore it is a highly developed city.]]>

My second example is in sorce #3 in paragraph 10, when it says, &quot;Tenochtitlan was an unusuallyy clean place. A thousand men swept and washed down the streets everyday.&quot; This example from the artical, demonstraits to us that the Aztecs always wanted to try to keep their cities looking as good as they could.]]>

In source #2, it says, &quot;They built the causeways with gaps joined by wooden bridges that could be removed to allow canoes to pass through and to keep enemies out.&quot; That shows how they were able to create advnaced ways of transportation that could also be used as a defense weapon without the heavy electronic machinery we have today. Another example is the streets in the city. In source #1, it says, &quot;There were few streets in the city. Instead, the aztecs built a regular grid of canals.&quot; This shows the difference in the layout and routes of the Aztecs city when compared to most other European cities, which is the way people could travel around the city and transport goods.

It was far bigger than any European country of the time&quot;. This supports that it was a highly devolped city because the people who lived there only had arrived there a little while ago and now they have a full town with laws, houses, markets, and much more. It only took Aztecs a short amount of time to build Tenochtitl'an city, but it took other European countries years to build a city with laws, houses, markets, and other things. Lastly, an example from source three to support that Tenochtitl'an was a highly devoloped city is,&quot;...More than 250,000 people lived there..&quot; This means that this city is highly devloped because even though the city was just built, 250,000 people lived there- and all of them are living!!! None died yet even though it is hard to get food, Aztecs still managed to get food as soon as they arrived. Also, it is not very easy to just put laws in place for people as soon as you arrive to the city, but they still managed to put laws in place and people follow the laws!!!]]>

And the next source is source three because about the city that had amazingly busy and colorful markets .And near the temple were the decorated stone palaces of the emperor and of the greatest nobles.And the last source is source one when the spanish explorer Hernando Cortes led an army to Mexico in 1519 and met The Aztecs, he was amazed by what he found . When he saw all those cities and villages built in the water, and other great towns on dry land ... we were astounded, 'wrote one of his soilders . 'Indeed, of our soilders asked wether it was not all a dream . The center of the Aztec empire was in the Valley of Mexico this high area with several large lakes, surrounded by mountains.Some of the towns were built on dry land, but others, like the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City), were built on islands or on swampy marshald.The Aztecs grew food in gardens, which were laid out in the marshes on the outskirts of the city.In the center of Tenchtitlan and other large cities were splendied temples and beautifully decorated public buildings.Technology in Aztec times depended more on human skills than on tools and machines.Morgan, N.(1998) Technology in the time of the Aztecs.

A palace that would be known as a mansion today. Technology in the Time of the Aztecs- More than 250,000 people lived there when Cortes and his soldiers arrived. There were palaces and law courts, public baths and markets. Many houses were built on raised platforms to protect them from floods.

The first way is in source #3 &quot;Bigger houses were built of stone, but toward the outskirts of the city they were made of cane, plastered with clay and a thatch of plam leaves.&quot; Just in the way they built there homes was one reason they were highly developed. Also in source #3 it says how and why the city was buily around a network of canals. &quot;The city was built around a network of canals. It's traders carried their wares in canoes. The sight of hundreds of canoes laden with foodstuff, crowding the lake and it's canals, amazed the spaniards.&quot; Since during this time period trade was also a big thing, the fact that they were able to do this amazed the spaniards and probably made them think again about the Aztecs. The way they were able to basically make anything in such amazing ways definitely made them even more highly developed. &quot;The pyramid rose to the temple at the top. Important temples had roofs made of wooden beams forming a point. These were covered with sticks and twigs and coated with a plaster made of mud and animal dung to keep out rain.&quot; That was from source #2. Even back then that eas pretty amazing since they didn't really know what they were doing or what was going to happen to them next. All they knew was how to try and stay into a government or more importantly a civilization.]]>

It was far bigger than any European city of the time, and it was very well organized&quot;. This supports it because I think of Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles to be highly devloped cities, and the quote says it was well organized, very big and impressive, and in my mind that is what New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago are like. I would consider the United States of America an highly devloped country, wouldn't you? Just like americans, they used tools. In source #2 it says; &quot; Aztec tools for crushing and hammering wooden shafts and stone heads. Their axes and other cutting tools had cooper blades. Chisels, hammers and scrapers were often made of volcanic rock, because this type of stone was very hard and strong&quot;. Those tools sound a lot like modern day tools.]]>

They also said in Source #1 that they had a grid of canals so that everyone could travel around the city by boat, and also transport goods if needed to. In the last paragraph, (of Source #1), the narrator says that &quot;..the Aztecs managed to build a highly developed civilizaton in just two hundred years.&quot; which I'm guessing means that in a short amount of time, they were able to do someting amazing with what they had. The Aztecs were absolutely inspiring people. In Source #2 it tells of how the Aztecs made aqueducts that would feed fresh water into the city. The Aztecs figured that if one of the two pipes that made up the aqueducts needed to be cleaned or repaired, the other one could continue to carry the water. The Aztecs were very, very smart.]]>

Tey definitely had a high quality for living for that time period. Also in the text, &quot;Tenochtitlan was linked to the main land by three raised roads or causeways.&quot; (Source #1) Again, they had only simple tools that they learned to use with great skill. This shows evidence of education or importance on learning which improves the standard of living and makes it a rather developed city.

This again proves how Aztecs took something normal, A: a house, a something insanely smart, B: raised platforms, and made it into something amazing that is still used today, C: a raised platform house. The builders of Tenochtitlan should be revered to this day because of their works with the city of Tenochtitlan. People of 500 years ago came up with a modern idea which is pretty amazing.]]>

There were few streets in the city. Instead, the Aztecs built a regular grid of canals so that people could travelaround the city and transport goods by boats.&quot; Thats one of the sources that I think has an idea of Tenochtitlan being a highly developed city. The other source is source #2 because in pragraph1 it syas, &quot;The Aztecs had good reason to be proud of their capital city. When Cortes and his soldiers arrived, they were amazed to find that Ten0chtitlan was far bigger than any Europeancity. More than 250,000 people lived there. There were palaces, law courts, public baths, and markets. Manyhouses were built onraised platforms to protect them from floods.Most were just one story high, becvause taller houses would have been tooheavy tostan on the marshy grouns.&quot; Those are the reasons why I think that Tenochtitlan was a highly developed city.]]>

Although they had no iron tools or carts with wheels, and no alphabet, the Aztecs managed to build a highly developed civilization in just two hundred years. The secret of their sucess was that they learned to use very simple tools with great skill. The Aztecs legacy lives in Mexico.&quot;]]>

Which is only 7 miles long for a fact. It most likely was able to have a bigger population (number of humans/men/women) because when the people visited there have to go back home and see their family and tell them what a wonderful place they took a vacation at. Then those people will obviously tell their friends and so on and so forth. Tenochtitlan was or still is the greatest city (most populated) at this moment, but i am sure i would travel there if i could then have a bigger population than 300,000 folks maybe just maybe it would be maybe half of the people in this planet (earth).]]>

When Cortes and his soilders arrived, they were amazed to find that Tenochtitlan was far bigger than any European city. More than two-hundred and fifty thousand people lived there. There were palaces, law courts, public baths, and markets. Many houses were built on raised platforms to protect them from floods. Most were just one story high, because taller houses would have been too heavy to stand on the marshy ground.&quot; And this section from article two also,&quot; Aztec tools for crushing and hammering had wooden shafts and stone heads. Their axes and other cutting tools had copper blades, Chisels, hammers, and scrapers were often made of volcanic rock because this type of stone was very hard and strong. They often used obsidian, a glassy volcanic stone, because it could be shaped to a very sharp edge, and pumice, another type of volcanic rock, for drilling, gridning and polishing.&quot; With those two sections I think that they prove that Tenochtitlan was a highy devoped city.]]>

They built two stone aqueducts so if one pipe was being cleaned or repaired, the other pipe line would still be able to bring in the citizen's fresh water. Also, in some places the aqueducts would open out to form reserviors to keep stock of the fresh water. In source #1, some of the city was just bulit on dry land, but other parts were built on swamplands and the parts of the city were linked with each other by canals, walkways, and bridges, this way it made tranportation and trade easier because all the people had to do was cross over to the other parts of the city to get what they need.]]>

I know this because us as americans are highly developed and if we don't know how they moved the blocks, then they have to be highly developed. Another piece of evidence is under the section building tools in source 2. It says that some of the tools for cutting was made out of copper blades. this means that they were so advanced that they could (1) be able to mine up the tool, (2) be able to smelt the tool, (3) and be able to craft it into a blade sharp enough to cut.`]]>

The text reads, &quot;The Aztecs had to carry all the stone and large pieces of wood they used in their buldings. Builders carried smaller materials in cone shaped baskets, called chundi, on their backs and supported the heavy load using a strap across their foreheads. We do not know how Aztecs moved blocks of stone or wood that were too heavy to carry. They did not have carts on wheels, so they must have found ways to use sleds, levers, and ropes, or rollers made from tree trunks to haul large blccks.&quot; This shows how Tenochtitlan was a highly developed city because, they did not have carts on wheels yet, so they figured out their own ways to carry heavy blocks to their working area. Another example is under the heading, &quot;Markets and City Life&quot;. The text reads, &quot;The city had amazingly busy and colorful markets. Each of the four main sections of the city had its local market.&quot; Another example is, &quot;Tenochtitlan was an unusually clean place. A thousnd men swept and washed down the streets every day. Garbage and human waste were carried away in barges.&quot; This shows how they knew already how to keep it a healthy place to live.]]>

That's why books would be very helpful to find these type's of thing's. Again because it would have a lot more information than a website would. Especially on how it was built. That is something a very big book would have a lot of information on. The other source is about the life in ancient Aztec city. The life there would be about working very hard every day. But the population grew to 80,000 people to even as many as 300,000. So there was a lot of Atecs sent to small towns to do their part. So the job became a lot easier for them because there was more people but the work was ver ,very harsh, and brudal!]]>

It was also a highly developed city because in the 3rd resource it says that the palaces were two stories high with 50 or more rooms. Also their baths were similar to modern day saunas and were regarded as very healthful.

One of the details is that when the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes led an army to Mexico in 1519 and met the Aztecs he was amazed by what he found. He saw cities and villages built of water and other great towns that were on dry land were out standing. Some of the towns were biult on dry land but others like the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City) were biult on islands or on swampy marshland. Another one is that Tenochtitlan was linked to the mainland by three raised roads or causeways. There were few streets in the city. Instead the Aztecs built a regular grid of canals so the people could travel around the city. and transport goods by boat. On souce 2# an important detail is the Aztecs had good reason to br proud of there capital city when Cortes and his soldiers arived they were amazed to find that Tenochtitlan was far bigger than any European city. More than 250,000 people lived there there were law courts and public baths and markets. They had temples and the temples were the most important buildings in Aztec towns. They were built on top of pyramids usually on a plat form. Another one is that they had tool and there tools they used for crushing and hammering and they were made of wooden shafts and stone heads. There axes and other cuting tools had copper blades and chisels hammers and scrapers were often made of volcanoe rock because this type of stone was very hard and strong. For source 3# an important detail is thatThe city had many amazing busy and colorful markets each four mane sections of the city had its local market there were also two huge ones in Tenochtitlan and that offered virtually every product that the Aztec empire had to offer. The markets were near the center of Tenochtitlan but the city center itself was the temple precinct. It was dominated by the two great pyramids temples that stood side by side their flights of steps like a pair of escalators facing west. Near the tamples were the decorated stone palaces of the emporer and of the greatest nobles they were two stories high. Another one is that people grew gardens at there houses and they lived in tiny houses they grew flowers, peppers , squash, fruit and other stuff. All these examples support this idea because they are civilized in all these ways and all the examples say that they were a highly developed city they grew food and they built temples and had emporers and had nobles.]]>
