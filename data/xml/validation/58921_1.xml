An example would be when Sue's dog, Levi jumps on her bed to alert her of the alarm clock going off. Levi &quot;told&quot; Sue, who is deaf, that the alarm went off by alerting her physically instead of verbally. This is what hearing dogs are for. Without them, those who are deaf will have to find other means of being aware to the sounds around them. The deaf could always have help from people, but dogs are easier to train and can stay with you longer than people can.]]>

If you are starting to believe that this is a bit to harsh, there is a reason behind it. Imagine that all you ever could hear was utter silence. You could be walking down a street and there be a gun shot right around the corner, but you couldn't hear it. That corner just happened to be on your daily routine...

They do know what their doing, they would kind of tell the feature. Some dogs are already trained to help the blind and the deaf, but some dogs can be already super smart to do all the things trained dogs can do. I think all dogs do obey, because they are smart but i dont know how to explain it like they are kind of smarter than humans and they have really big brains than human does. Also dogs can move you away from danger, like if someone wanted to shoot you, then a dog may jump in front of you or pull you away from where the shooter is aiminig. Some dogs can learn tricks very easly, like a hand shake or how to sit, but the hardest i think there are is how to roll over. I know that dogs in training programs or something else they have to make a high standard. Some dogs are like human they can eat human food and do human things, and also certain dogs can talk, like in some videos you see on youtube they would say like &quot;I Love You&quot; or they could say &quot;Hi&quot;. But anyways dogs are a very smart things on this earth.]]>

Whenever a sound is to be heard, the dogs warn the humans to keep them out of danger and aware of their surrondings. The dogs are like the human's ear. Just like a seeing eye dog, hearing dogs help people that don't have their hearing senses. The dogs, in both cases (when someone is blind or deaf), give humans the oppurtunity to have the same senses like any other person. Therefore, hearing dogs are very important to a person that has a disability because they keep them safe.]]>

The dog must train also to see how well they can help their owners. In order for the owner to interact with a dog, the must be able to take good care of their dog and know when to respond back to a dog when they are trying to help you understand what is going on around them. When the owner of the dog cannot hear what is going on like for example, an alarm, a cell phone ringing, people talking, and a car honking at them, then the dog must respond to the owner so that the owner can be aware of it. The hearing dogs must do their routine every day to help the owner who is either blind or deaf. Sue is deaf and Levi goes onto her bed and wakes Sue up to snooze he alarm so that it wont go on forever and so that she wont miss anyhing or be late. Hearing dogs are very helpful to deaf or blind people who needs help to interact with things.]]>

The dog is responsible to make sure nothing fatal happens to the owner. These dogs can help even with the most simple things.

For example &quot;assistance dogs&quot;, seeing eye dogs,and also &quot;hearing ear&quot; dogs.It is very hard to train the assistance dogs.They have to know a baby's cry, phone ringing, doorbell ringing, a microwave buzzer, a smoke alarm going off.The &quot;assistance dogs&quot; are also trained to hear traffic and honking horns and other traffic noises.The dogs have to follow comands 90% of the time and have to react to a sound in 15 seconds.When the dog hears something it is trained to show their owner by being phisical so the dog can somtimes raise a paw like trying to give a handshake. After the dog gets the owners attention the dog will lead the owner to the source of the sound. The owner must also take training so they learn how to take care of the dog and what the dog is trying to say. In cocclusion dogs are very well trained to help out as much as they can.]]>

Most of the time when they are unaware of noises like a door bell, a phone ringing and a alarm clock the dog must wake them up to get on with their day. They must respond to the human 90% to basic obedience commands of time and respond to a sound within 15 seconds or less.
