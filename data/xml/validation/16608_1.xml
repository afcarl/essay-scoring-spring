Being in highschool restricts you from many things and usually those things are danger. You have your parents to watch out for you when you drive and they can telll you your mistakes. As you grow older, your parents will as wel, so it makes it harder for them to continue to watch you. They will believe that you are independent and can survive on your own. so once your in college many crazy things will happen. College is usually the year that students will start partying or staying up late at night and becoming drunk, since you usually dont have someone to tell you to not drink. Being a 16 year old student in highschool I can assure that life is tough at home because your have your parents to always tell you what to do.</p>]]>

The reason this is so is because it seems as though they have less accidents only because there are not as many liscenced 16 year olds as 17 18 and 19 year olds. In fact 36% of 16 year olds get into accidents, 31% of 17 year olds, 29% of 18 year olds and 25% of 19 year olds.

I agree because teen drivers have recently learned the information which means they are more likely to remember it on the road. The rules seem fairly new to them and are more likely to follow them since they don't have as much experience driving. Also, teens should be driving by themselves which means if something happens, it affects one person, not multiple.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Teenagers can also be some of the unsafest drivers around. I have been to classes about driving safely on the road and rules to abide by. I have seen a video with some guys in the car and decide it would be funny to slam the door on a guy trying to get in. They do so and roll right over him. Also, at this age, teenagers want to look cool and powerful as well. They think the way to show this is by driving extremely fast. Some people I have talked to say they drive 90 mph on the highway. I asked why and they said, &quot;Because I want to.&quot; Driving way over the speed limit can increase your chances of getting hit, but you can also hurt other people. By not following the rules of the road, you could hit someone else and devastating consequences can occur. When they drive too fast, they lose control of the car, spin around and run into someone and can't stop their vehicle. Teens also decide to think they are all that and text and drive, which is extremely dangerous. Things can happen on the road when you are not looking. They don't know when the light will change and there are possibilities for accidents or collisions. Peer pressure can also make teens unsafe drivers. If they want to have some &quot;fun,&quot; others will encourage the driver so go faster and speed on the acceleration. I heard a story about this one teenager who was a great student, on the football team, and a fantastic kid. One night he made a stupid decision that would change his life forever. He got into his car and drove some of his friends to a party. His friends wanted him to go faster, and he knew it was wrong. But this kid went ahead and did so, which got them in an accident. Everyone survived but the driver. It is so important to make your own decisions and not conform to peer pressure no matter what anyone says.&nbsp;Mostly, I disagree with Frank because also media shows these scenarios with peope texting and driving, which makes people think it is acceptable and safe.</p>]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[<p>I do not agree with Franks statement because although 16 year old's have the fewest number of accidents, they also have a significantly lower number of licensed drivers. For 17, 18, and 19 year old's there are well over 2 million licensed drivers and around 700,000 accidents but for 16 year old's there are only 1.5 million drivers and 580,000 accidents. The question asked is about the age group with the fewest accidents and for most people the fastest way to get the answer would be to look at the number of accidents and see which is lowest. In reality the number of licensed drivers greatly effects the number of accidents. If the number of licensed drivers at age 16 were the same or closer to the numbers at age 17, 18, or 19 than the data would show that the number of accidents were about doubled. Therefore the licensed drivers at 16 years old do not have the lowest amount of accidents.&nbsp;</p>]]>

However, from the chart they have 580,000 fewest number of accidents than the other age of teenage drivers they also have less number of licensed drivers. This would be why there was less number of accidents. Many teenager gets ther licensed at the age of 17 years old and older.</p>]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[<p>I disagree with Frank because 16 year olds maybe the one who has the least amount of accidents out of all the other teenage drivers but this is because they are new to driving so they are more careful than the experienced drivers and have less licensed drivers in that age. The data above shows that there are only 1,578,000 licensed drivers that are 16 years old while there are 2,195,000 17 year old drivers, 2,432,000 18 year olds, and 2,653,000 19 year old drivers. 17-19 years old have higher number of accidents than 16 year olds because there are more licensed drivers in that age group so there are more chances of them getting in an accident. Just because they have a higher number of accidents that doesn't mean that they're not safe drivers.&nbsp;</p>]]>

Althought the number of accidencts is lowest for those of who are 16 years old, it doesn't neccessarily mean they are the safest. Compared with the number who are licensed, about 37% of teens get into accidents, which is signicficantly lower than the other age groups who boste small percentages such as 25% for the 19 year olds. The only reason the number of accidents for 16 year olds is lower is because their is a significant less licensed number of them. By comparing percentages, it can be seen that in fact, 16 year olds are the most dangerous.</p>]]>

I believe that 16 year olds are safe because when they recieve their license, they drive really safe to avoid getting tickets or into an accident. As drivers progresses with their experience in driving, they tend to speed and do reckless things, such as drifting. 18 years old is when most teens are seniors or freshman in college, thus they're exposed to drugs and alcohol. They probably drive home drunk or on drugs from parties. 19 years old is the same as they too are in college.</p>]]>

There is a big difference between a one in a million chance and a one in a thlousand chance, after all. Similarly, looking at the percentages of teen drivers involved in accidents can depict a more accurate version of the story. Taking the ratios into account, 36.76% of sixteen-year-olds are involved in accidents, as opposed to 25.25% of nineteen-year-olds. This means that sixteen-year-olds have a far greater chance of being involved in accidents and are thus the least safest drivers.</p>]]>

Another reason is that since most of them do not have a license, they aren't able to cause any accident at all. This is why there is so few of them actually licensed.

Also, they're only 16, so they cant get drunk or some stupid stuff that screws up the rest of their life.

In my own experiences, I've noticed that 16 year olds are probably more immature than 19 year olds. Every teenager will eventually have his need for speed day and when it comes, its going to be more likely tackled on by a 19 year old than one who is younger. Also, for 16 year olds who are starting to drive, their insurace cost is already over the roof, and if they get into an accident, the price is going to be even bigger, so they have a mindset to try their best not to get into an accident.</p>]]>

But, they are also really reckless in a lot of things so why would they be careful at driving? They wouldn't, they act the same as before so therefore i don't agree with Frank and i think that 16 year olds are the most unsafe out of all teenage drivers.</p>]]>

When a kid is 16 years old they think they know everything, but they dont. I know because I myself am 16. Drving is very useful but can also be very danferous. The reason why 16 year olds dont have a lot of accidents is because there are less 16 year olds than the 17-19 year olds. Parents arent just going to let their 16 year old drive knowing that they are irresponsible. They have to proove their parents otherwise with doing chore without being told, getting good grades, taking care of siblings, etc. Driving is a privelage.&nbsp;</p>]]>

The reason why the numbers increase as the age increases would be that they're not with an guide/adult making it more likely for an accident to happen since they're not careful enough. Addionally 16 year olds are more cautious of the way how they drive, since they're anamateur. When being an beginner in things, you're bound to be more aware about the thing that you're doing and concentrated and focused. The more you get used to it the less careful and attentive you'll be.

Frank, in his teenage egocentrism, has only bothered to look at the &quot;number of accidents&quot; column, disregarding the &quot;number of licensed drivers&quot; entirely. This is a mistake. By creating a ratio of number of accidents to number of drivers in each age group, and then gleaning the percentges from that ratio, I found that the members of the 16-year-old driver category were at least 5% more likely to get into an accident than the closest other age group, the 17-year-olds. They are a whopping 11% more likely to be in an accident than the 19-year-old drivers.</p>]]>

So hey, there's this really great band called Brand New that you should definitely check out. The album &quot;The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me&quot; is SO good. It's not even religious, which I find nice. I'm not a fan of Christian Rock. It doesn't make Christianity any better, it just makes rock worse.</p>]]>

But now I think he's kind of a scum bag.&nbsp;</p> <p>My favorite topping on my frank is that chili joint. I prefer to eat them on tuesdays because it's hotdog Tuesday. But when it's not hotdog Tuesday I'm not sure what i want to eat. What do you like to eat when it's not Tuesday.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[<p>I would agree with Frank for the most part, due to the evidence from the data table. The chart doesn't really go into too much detail about why 16 year-olds are the safest drivers, it just so happens that they get in the least amount of accidents. Most likely if someone has their lisense at age 16, they haven't been driving very long. There'a a good chance that a 18 or 19 year old would have more experience. However, I'v noticed 17-19 year-olds typically get out more, and if they have had their liscense for a while, they could easily become over-confident, which can be a major threat to safety. Now as far as 16-year-old drivers go, they're still living with their parents, or have more authority over them since they're under 18.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also makes sense because they have just started driving, so they're likely to be more cautious. If they do happen to get in a wreck, their parents will be all over it, so that kind of puts fear into them. These are things I've learned from personal experience, along with basic facts, and of coarse, the data chart. If I had to argue one thing it would be that, 16 year olds, for the most part are the least experienced in driving, so they will most likely get into a few accidents because of it, or their nerves get to them. Over all I can understand why it's the 19-year olds that end up in the most accidents.</p>]]>

They try to be more safe also because the barely started to drive and they don't want to get in trouble with the law. Also they don't want to get a ticket at a young age. In my opinion not all teenagers are safe drivers, some just drive safe when an adult is with them and when they are alone, they might even break some laws. But Frank is right, maybe younger teenagers are the safest drivers because they have barely gotten their license or permit, they want their record to be clean.</p>]]>

This I took the total number of drivers in each category and divided that number by the number of people who got into accidents. Sixteen year olds had the greatest ratio of crashes to drivers, for this reason, and also because REFUGEE children from Isreal should have been rescued after the mass genocide of the Jews by Hitler, Frank was wrong.</p>]]>

Because the numer of licensed drivers is not equal for all four age groups, the number of accidents cannot be directly compared to each other; the percentage of licensed drivers who get into accidents for each age group needs to be found. Although Frank is correct that 16-year-olds have the fewest number of accidents, the percentage of 16-year-olds who get in an accident is the highest of the four ages. If we divide the number of accidents for 16-year-olds and divide by the number of licensed drivers for 16-year-olds, we can see that around 37% of 16-year-olds get into an accident: 580000/1578000 = 0.37*100 = 37%. Repeating this process for the three other age groups, we find that 32% of 17-year-olds get into accidents, 29% of 18-year-olds get into accidents, and only 25% of 19-year-olds get into accidents. Therefore, Frank's claim is incorrect: 16-year-olds are actually the most likely age group of licensed teenage drivers to get into an accident, whereas 19-year-olds are actually the safest teenage drivers whom are least likely to get into an accident.</p>]]>

As you grow older, you tend to forget about the small rules. For example, coming out of drivers ed, you know that you should turn into the closest lane to you but a few years down the road, you may think of that rule as a lesser important one and stop following it. Another example that applies to this is a teenager in drivers ed gets used to coming to a complete stop at every stop sign because they are being monitored but once a teen is licensed and on their own, they get used to rolling stops because no one is watching them.</p>]]>

This equation will get you the percent of accidents each age group are involved in. 16-year-old are involoved in 37%, 17year-olds are involved in 32%, 18year-olds are involved in 29%, and finally 19-year-olds ar involved in 25% of accidents.

Perhaps the number of accidents of 16 year old drivers is decreased compared to those older because there are less 16 year olds with licenses. If you were to increase the number of teenage drivers on the road at the age of 16, the amount might increase. This would make the 19 year old age group the safest drivers because they'd have the fewest number of accidents but in this case, 16 year olds are the safest drivers.</p>]]>

When looking at just the numbers, 16 years have the lowest number of people driving compared to 17, 18 and 19, plus they also have the least amount of accidents. Once you find the percentage of the results to even out the different number of drivers and accidents, though, you will find that 16 years only have 27% in accidents (the smallest percentage) while 19 year olds have 39% of number accidents (the biggest percentage). This here shows, even though the number of drivers is different, 16 year olds do in fact get into less accidents.<br> &nbsp;</p>]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[<p>I disagree with Frank because the percentage of drivers who get in accidents actually goes down as the drivers get older, from 36% at 16 years to 25% at 19 years, and the only reason the number of accidents goes up is because the number of drivers goes up from 1.6 million to 2.7 million.</p>]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[<p>I do agree in some ways, but not others. There are far less licensed drivers at age 16, so there would possibly be less accidents. However, if there were as many 16 year old licensed as there are 19 year olds I think that the number would be much higher.</p>]]>
