Yes, they may have least accidentsout of 17,18 and 19 year olds, but that doesn't mean that they are the safest teenage drivers. Just because they have the least amount of accidents, doesn't mean they drive well. As far as i know, I would say that 19 year olds are safer than them because there are 1.6 million 16 year olds that have drivers license and 2.6 million 19 year olds and there number of accidents is only 54,000 bigger than the 16 year olds, So i disagree</p>]]>

Jose reasons that because the number of accidents is lower in the 16 year old range, they are therefore the safest. However, Jose fails to recognize that the number of licensed drivers is different for each age range. Therefore, the number alone cannot prove that 16 year olds are safe drivers. There needs to be a percentage rate since the more registered drivers there are, there are more recorded accidents. Calculating the percentage rate of accidents among teenage drivers by dividing the number of licensed drivers from the number of accidents and multiplying by 100. The calculations are as follows rounded to the nearest hundreth: 38.9% of 16 year old drivers were in an accident, 30.78% of 17 year old drivers were in an accident, 28.38% of 18 year old drivers were in an accident, and 25.25% of 19 year olds were in an accident. By the calculated data, 16 year olds had the highest percentage rate of accidents out the entire teenage driver group. Therfore, 16 year old drivers are more likely to be in an accident.</p>]]>

A 16-years-old can have 20 hours of practice driver and may get in an accident versus another 16-years-old having 80 hours of driving practice and is less likely to get in an accident.

For example, i have friends that when they recently get their licesne they feel cool and they start driving every where with their friends they come back late their are mosly naver home. they start getting texting while driving after parties they are drunk and risk they're life to drive will they're drunk they start racing. nd well that can cause to seriosly bad damege to them and to inasint people.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;At first they may start good drivers and safe and being cautios of everything but once they get conftable they start theyre distruction!!</p>]]>

For 16 year olds, nearly 38.1% were in an accident. I dont think that it is Jose's fault either, because it may be due to social injustice in his neighborhood. If Jose(assuming is Latin American) is bullied in school, he may have left his studies for the underwold cartels which is no good for anyboy. With this course of action, he has effectively left behind a part of his academic self. Math therefore is a thing of the past for him, and is it for this reason that he has been unable to CORRECTLY calculate the sauid number.&nbsp;</p>]]>

The table above displays 17, 18, and 19 year olds have a number ranging from 2,200,000 to 2,650,000 that are licensed, while 16 year olds have a number of 1,634,000. The number of accidents between the age groups is fairly the same. If one were to double the amount of licensed drivers for the age 16, one can infer that the number of accidents would be a lot higher as well.</p>]]>

The statistics shown doesn't show how often that person drives, and at age 16, the individual may not be driving often, thus the explanation why 16-year olds have the least number of accidents. To follow up, older individuals such as 18-year old and 19-year old may have a job to go to which leads to them being on the road more. In addition, there are more licensed drivers for the 17-, 18-, and 19-year old drivers than there are for 16-year olds. Those who are 17-year old have about 600,000 more licensed drivers than 16-year old, but they only have 56,000 more accidents. There are far more licensed drivers over the age of 16 with lower amounts of accidents compared to a low number of 16-year old drivers with a high amount of accidents.</p>]]>

So the higher the age the less likely it is to get in an accident.</p>]]>

Per 16 year old driver there are .38 accidents while per 17 year old driver there are .3 accidents. By the time there are 19 year old drivers there are .25 accidents per driver. So 16 year old drivers have the highest rate of accidents per driver so they are the least safe.&nbsp;</p>]]>

The number of licensed 16 year old drivers is nearly half of the number of 17, 18, and 19 year old drivers. Although the number of licensed drivers of the age 16 is inferior to the licensed drivers of other ages, the number of accidents is in the same range. Out of the 1,600,000 16 year old drivers 624,000 of accidents are registered being an approximate amount of 45%.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[<p>I do not agree with Jose. The evidence provided shows that, though the pool of 16-year-old drivers holds the lowest number of accidents, the number of licensed 16-year-olds is significantly lower than the pools of 17-, 18-, and 19-year-olds. Percentage-wise, the number of accidents per number of drivers in the 16-year-old pool is much greater than those of the other age groups.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Statistically, younger drivers tend to be more reckless and thusly are involved in a greater number of accidents than older drivers, understandably. I think the recklessness stems from the thrill of being a young driver, and seeing from the provided evidence the relatively low number of 16-year-old drivers, it is safe to assume that those who get their licenses early and boastful and that there is some correlation between recklessness on the road and sheer pride/lack of humility.&nbsp;</p>]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[<p>In a sense, Jose may be correct. When you look at statistics and other things of that sort, you see that teenage drivers are the ones who are affected the most due to accidents and other things of that sort. When you look at the chart above, you see that the numbers of drivers increase, and so does the number of accidents. When drivers are sixteen years old, the number of accidents are not as high. This may be due to the fact that teens have just obtained a license or permit and want to drive as safe as possible. Knowing me, I would definitely not want to get my permit or license taken away because of reckless driving, Now don't get me wrong, some sixteen year olds could care less about how they drive (those are the 624,000 sixteen year olds who make up the number of accidents in this age group every year). Now, when you look at the age group from seventeen to eighteen, you would think that the average number of accidents would have increased dramatically. This is definitely not the case, the older they got...the more reckless they got. But, you always have to take other things into consideration like the fact that the number of licensed drivers goes up, and so do the numbers of accidents (only by 66,000 drivers). The number of drivers had increased, by about 500,000 drivers...so when you compare 66,000 accidents to 500,000 drivers...ir's not as bad as the other statistics. Now when you look at 19 year olds, you see that they start to mature...and driving becomes second hand to them, and they are able to avoid peoplewho do not drive as well as them. So, to answer this question...I do not believe that sixteen year olds are the safest drivers are the safest drivers...I believe abyone past 19 years of age are the safest drivers.</p>]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[<p>I disagree with Jose, 16 year old drivers are not nearly as safe as he claims, and I feel they are the most dangerous on the road. Around 38% of 16 year old drivers undergo accidents according to the table, Which is far greater then the 31% of 17 year olds, the 28% of 18 year olds and the 25% of 19 year olds. Putting this in perspective, the rise in percentage among the age implies a formula that rises in accidents per driver as ones age increases. I found this information by putting the number of accidents in a ratio over the number of licensed drivers, and find this as evidence of young drivers being dangerous on the road.</p>]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[<p>I do not agree one-hundred percent with Jose. I don't agree with his claim that 16-year-olds are the safest teenage drivers because they have a least number of accidents. 16-year- olds that are licensed driver make up about 1,634,000 according to the graph and they have fewer accidents. But if you look at the graph the number of licensed drivers in older ages they have more people driving. And their number of accidents kind of level up to about the same number. If you divide the number of licensed drivers with the number of accidents it gives you sort of a percent. For 16-year-olds it was 2.62 and for 17-year olds it was 3.25, for 18-year olds it was 3.52, and for 19-year olds it was 3.95. Overall they are pretty close to one another. Another thing that has to be considered is that how many hours of practice driving did each age group get. If 16-year-olds got more that would explain why they had fewer accidents than those of other age groups.</p>]]>

Yet when you compare the number of accidents they have 624,000 which is about the same as the others. The percentage of 16 year olds would be higher then the rest. They have about 600000 less than the closest person next to them. The least number of accidents doesn't even matter. You have to break down and solve the numbers. The number of licensed drives at age 19 is 26530000 which is a million more then any. Yet there number of accidents is less then 18 year olds. The difference is only 46 thousand between 16 and 19. I would have to say that 19 year old and 18 year olds would be the higher numbers of all of them totaled togheter. 16 year olds also would be the highest because the number of licensed drivers compared to the other is less and the accidents is in the same range about.</p>]]>

For age 17, it's 30.8%. For 18, it's 28.4%. Fianlly, for 19, it's 25.3%. Through these rates, we see the safest drivers are 19, and drivers are most unsafe at 16.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]>

A 16-year-old, in my opinion, is in a way, more likely to be in an accident, because they have recently learned the rules of driving, thus it is more probable that they will make a mistake. Yes, they have less accidents, but that is only because they are being cautious with these new laws they have learned. By the time they reach the age of 17 or 18, which is the age when most accidents are occurring, they feel comfortable enough with the rules they begin to get lazy or overconfident in their driving ability, thus they make wrong decisions and cause accidents. Being 16-years old does not make you the safest driver, it just makes them more cautious, but they are after all, still human and can make mistakes.</p>]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jose claims that 16-year-olds have the least number of accidents, therefore they are the safest drives. Even though the total number of accidents of sixteen-year-olds is far below any other age group, his assumption is false. Comparing the numbers of accidents to the number of licensed drivers allows one to understand the ratio of accidents based on an age group. The date was constructed by using the number of licensed drivers of an age group and dividing that number by the corresponding number of accidents of drivers in that age group. This data allows one to study the amount of people in a ratio to the number of accidents. For example, the number of sixteen-year-old licensed drivers, 1,634,000, is divided by the number of accidents of sixteen-year-olds, 624,000. Based off of this calculation for ever 2.6 sixteen-year-olds there is one accident. The same formula was used to find the ratio for the other age groups: 3.24 seventeen-year-olds per one accident; 3.52 eighteen-year-olds per one accident; and 3.96 nineteen-year-olds per one accident. Based of the data collected the ratio of sixteen-year-olds to the number of accidents does not support Jose's claim that sixteen-year-olds are the safest drivers.</p>]]>

She is correct that 16-year-olds collectively have the least amount of accident, however, she is not taking into account that there are a substantial less amount of total 16-year-old drivers than any other listed age group. In fact, they are more likely to get intop an accident than any other age, because the ratio of accidents caused by 16-year-olds to the actual number of 16-year-old drivers is .38. This is compared to the safest of the groups, the 19-year-olds, of a ratio of .25 accidents per driver. This data shows that 16-year-olds are not the safest drivers.</p>]]>

Jus because you have not had an accident does not mean you are the safest driver. Anything can happen on the road at anytime without seeing it coming. The most experienced driver who has not had an accident could end up in one at anytime on the road. You could be a professional driver such as a racecare driver and still get into accidents or even cause one. As long as you have road smarts and follow the laws there should be no accidents.</p>]]>

The reason as well that they have the least accidents is also because they have the least number of licensed drivers at the age of 16 years.

While someone has the chance to get their permit at age 16 and Some dont learn until they are older. For instince&nbsp; I am 17 years old and I haven't took my test or ever been on a wheel. Learning these kind of things take time to learn and I yet need to know.&nbsp; I believe that it is more important to learn to drive at age 16 then where I am at. That way we are safe from violece like rapers and other violece in the streets. When someone is in their car they are more safe than someone being out in the wild with the animals that can kill us. I guess thats why at the age 16 the number of students learn to drive.</p>]]>

I believe it depends on how 16-years-old from five or ten years got in accidents to 16-year-old now getting in car accidents. I say this because it shows either two things. One, it could show that 16-year-old are reducing the amount of accidents over the course of year. Or, it could show that the number of accidents are increasing of the course of years. This is showing over a course of years, having more data, versus having just from one year of how many accidents are happening with each age groups.</p>]]>

According to the table, 16-year-olds had a 38.188% accident rate whilst 17, 18, and 19-year olds had percentages lower than that of 16-year-olds.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>16 year olds: 38.188%</p> <p>17 year olds: 30.783%</p> <p>18 year olds: 28.380%</p> <p>19 year olds: 25.254%<br> &nbsp;</p>]]>

They were all licensed drivers but other ones had more lisenced drivers so thats why the number of accidents increased.</p>]]>
