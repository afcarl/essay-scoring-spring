I believe that making ice cream available to students during lunch should be allowed by the school administration because there are still health benefits which can be found in ice creams. If availability of ice cream during lunch is one way to keep a student's flow of energy going, why shouldn't the school administration consider it; plus, it will energize students throughout their activities.

Its been documented that teens grow faster than adults. So taking away the ice cream booth is also taking away the chance kids get to eat and get their essential nutrients. I, personally, being a teenager do not eat much, with being busy and not haviong the time to do it. And when I do eat I can tell you, that I do not get the right amount of nutrients that teenagers shouold be getting.

Most of student body will agree, that we need ice cream back in our cafeteria. Though the school administration and the parents would disagree, ice cream is a vital development to a teens healh. Before you think this is another rant about the SBAC I would like to point out that I am not ranting but protesting the education system and standardized tests. 1st-5th grade I went to a private school and had straight Fs in all the core subjucts through 1st through 5th grade. I did not pay attention in class causing me to not understand the subject which then paralized me from doing my work. Countless times I was told to pay attention by my teacher but I never listened. You may think &quot;Well it's your fault you didn't pay attention&quot; but then, I transferred to public school in 6th grade then began to get higher grades, working my way up from a D. Time passed and I reached high school then I looked around and saw that I had become so used to getting good grades, I began to fear fail. Even though we are taught fail is a vital part of sucess. I thought of my self as stupid when I was younger for not paying attention, though, I might of been smarter back then than I am now. Because I remembered while the rest of the class was studying to pass, I was writing stories in the back of the class. Or when we were writing essays, I was doodling in my notebook contemplating life in an alternet universe. I passed music and art class with flying colors but, when it came to math I was stuck in the gutters. I wasn't afraid to fail because by societies tems I was already failing. So why do I score low on Algebra tests when I can name the majority of countries on a world map? Or why can I write fictional stories with ease when I get writers block while writing an essay? It's because I work that way and I won't let society tell me I'm useless and stupid because of some grade on a test that I won't even need for the rest of my life.]]>
