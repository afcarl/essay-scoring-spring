Icy lumps of snow had gathered in piles where the slope flattened.&quot; Jake is also a quick thinker too because if it wasn't for his quick thinking, Paul would not have been able to get out under the piles of snow on-top of him. In the text it says, &quot;Jake knew that trained skiers who were caught in an avalanche would try to swim atop the flow and get to the side of the avalanche field just past a rock.

When Paul fell, Jake knew that he was nervous and concerned about Paul, but tried to put these feelings behind him so he could concentrate. When he was calm, he listened to what he had to do. He followed the patrolmen and helped them to search, as he was told. When searching, Jake was very observant. If he noticed something, he did not let it pass him by. Instead, he spoke up to see if his observations made a difference, which they did. For example, he saw a glimmer of light when they were searching and immediately knew it might be a part of Paul' skis, which could help them to find Paul. So, he called the other patrolmen to come look at the light and see if it was Paul. The light was the tip of Paul's ski, and because Paul was with his skis, they were able to find Paul. These examples from the text show how Jake put his worries behind him so he could pay his full attention to what needed to be done. Therefore, I've concluded that Jake is very observant, focused, and determined in a crisis.]]>

Jake followed the three patrolmen as they hurriedly skied halfway down the icy slope to the top of the avalnche debris.&quot; Even during his first day on the job, even over such a long distance, and even with the possiblity of death, Jake still did what was right and followed the patrolmen to try and help. Also in paragraphs 26, the text says &quot;Thank your reporter buddy over here. Jake was the one who spotted your ski tip sticking out of the snow.&quot; This shows that Jake was willing to work and actually try to help in some way, even when there were three other profesionals that could have probably done better.&quot; This is what conclusion I drew about Jakes behavior in a crisis.]]>
