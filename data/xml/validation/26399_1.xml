It was baseball practice time, and the coach had divided the team into two groups to have a practice play. Will had reached first base, but the other team caught the ball in time, so he was out. Will said that he was safe, but their coach said that he was out. Will complained and complained, and soon everyone, even the people who were in his group, said Will was out. Will remembered he had stomped off the field and ran all the way home. Now, Will wished that he could have just sat down on the benches and admit he was out. He sighed. All of a sudden, he heard a twinkling sound above his head. He couldn't believe his eyes. There was a fairy in his room! &quot;W-Who are you!&quot;, Will exclamied. &quot;I am Ann.&quot;, the fairy replied calmly back. Ann was wearing a furry sweater, along with blue jeans. &quot;You semm pretty upset. What's the matter?&quot; Will sighed again and told the fairy everything. How the championship game was canceled, how he and his friends got into a fight. &quot;Hmm. Sound's like you need to apologize.&quot;, said Ann. Will said,&quot;I know, but I'm afraid that my friends won't listen.&quot; &quot;Well, you have to try.&quot;, Ann said. Will slowly dragged himself to the phone. He dialed the number and waited. &quot;Hello?&quot;, a voice said. Will knew it was his bect buddy, Arnold. Will apologized and asked if he could forgive him. Silence. Then Arnold said,&quot;I can forgive you.&quot; Will jumped up with joy. &quot;How about this&quot;, Arnold said.&quot; Come over to my house. Everyone else is here. We are watching movies.&quot; Will said yes and hung up. Ann had disappeared. Will said softly,&quot; Thank you Ann.&quot; He ran downstairs and shouted,&quot;Mom, can you drive me to Arnold's house?&quot;]]>

Are you boys' going to wash your hands first, said Will's mom.&quot; Who ever washes thier hands last is a rotten egg&quot;, said Will. They dashed to the restroom and started to push eachother to get the hand soap. They ran back to the table. Will was the rotten egg and Justin was the winner. After they finished eating, Will's mom looked at the clock and told Justin he needed to go home because it was late. Will and Justin walked to the car. Will's mom told them to get in to take Justin back home. 15 minutes later, they got to Justin's house. Once Justin got out of the car, he ran to his mom and hugged her. &quot;Say thank you Will , said Will's mom. &quot;Thank you for letting Justin play&quot; said Will.

One of the team memebers said &quot;lets play baseball with a tennis ball in the house and act like its the champuionship game. After that they made teams 7 players on each team. Will was concered that something would brake or someone would get hurt. But they started playing anyway. Will pitched the ball to teh other team the batter hit the ball but it went strait through a gass shandelear. The shandelear came smashing to the ground as Will's mom came running in to the room crying cause that was her favorite thing in the house. Therefore all the boys were kicked out and Will was placed in his room for the rest of the day.]]>

He told Josh to call the catcher an tell him that they were going to have a baseball party! Next he called the rest of the infield, and like his mom predicted, they were all bored and said they would be delighted to come. The outfield all said that they were very happy to have something to on such a lousy day. The party was very exiting and since will had a pool the team brought their bathing suits with them and everyone ended up playing ball in the pool the best part was that Wills mom went out and bought cake and pizza to eat. After the party, Will told his mom that she had saved his Saturday and was no longer disappointed that the game was canceled.]]>

But do all of you have money?&quot; All of the kids fished their pockets to find at least ten dollars. &quot;Good!&quot; explained Will's mom. &quot;We can see a movie!&quot; About an hour later, everybody was at the theatre. But there was one problem: It was packed. Everybody had gone to see the one movie the wished to watch, Bears! &quot;Oh no!&quot; cried Will, &quot;We can't see Bears!&quot; Joey replied, &quot;How about Rio 2?&quot; By the time Rio 2 had began, all of the boys were munching on gooey, messy, cheesy popcorn.

Then Will's mom came in the door. She said,&quot;Oh come on boys, you can think better than that! Use your imagination.&quot; The boys thought incredibly hard. Then Will jumped up shouting, &quot;I know what we could do!&quot; &quot;We could make a fort, tell scary stories, and have pillow fights!&quot; exclaimed Will. Everyone sat up chairs and stools to make the fort. Will's mom gathered all the blankets she could find. Then the boys told scary stories that made everyone shake, had pillow fights that made everyone laugh, and Will's mom even made popcorn so they can watch a movie. As time went by, Will eventually had to bid his baseball team goodbye. &quot;I'll see you at the championship!&quot; Will called out. As he walked back into the house, he said, &quot;Thanks Mom, you really did save my Saturday.&quot;]]>

Will jumped up and down in happiness. &quot;Mommommom!&quot;, he said in a rush, &quot;I got a great idea! Let's go to the store right now, please!&quot; They came back from shopping with watermelon, strawberries, bananas, and lots of other fresh fruit. He spread a checked blanket out on the floor and layed out the food so that it looked like a rainbow of fruit. Just then, the doorbell rang. Ding ding ding! &quot;Come in!&quot; shouted Will. All the boys laughed and talked and ate the fresh fruit. &quot;This was a GREAT idea, having an indoor picnic!&quot;]]>

All the kids from the baseball team shortly arrived at Will's house. All the kids asked,&quot; What is your idea!&quot; He finally said,&quot; You know how my mom knows coach very well?&quot; &quot;Yes, why?&quot; the kids from the team asked. &quot;We're driving to coach's house!&quot; &quot;Yay!&quot; Later that day the team went to the coach's house. They found out the hard way at school that when coach is taking a nap you DON'T wake him up. What do you know. When we got to his house we could see him throught the window and he was taking a nap! I was hoping he had some hope we were going to have the championships. Everyone on the team knew he had a &quot;secret&quot; crush on my mother so I bet some how she could charm him. We decided that my mom should wake him up. He finally woke up after about thirty minutes. He was very alarmed. &quot;Who are you? Why are you in my hou-&quot; coach screamed. &quot;It's me! Will's mother.&quot; my mother explained. &quot;Well, hello there!&quot; coach said. &quot;I was wondering if we could get the Championships back on?&quot; my mother grinned at me. &quot;Ummmm, well,&quot; We all were crossing our fingers. &quot;Anything for you. I mean why not!&quot; &quot;Thankyou sir!&quot; my mother said. We were all so excited that we all started jumping. Coach hadn't known we were in his house and well some of us broke a lot of stuff. He jumped as soon as he heard it. &quot;What was that?&quot; coach asked. &quot;What was what?&quot; my mother asked while she was totally saving us. &quot;Oh, maybe I was just hearing something. &quot;Probably.&quot; After that my mother rushed him out of bed. He told my mother to go away while he was changing. She was way ahead of him. He saw us and the glass broken everywhere. He was about to yell but my mother calmed him down. Soon we were at the game field. We called the other team and in about foruty five minutes they were there. We explained everything to them and they understood. They called all the fans that they have and soon enough everyone was here. At the end of the game I was pitching. I knew that right now everyone depended on me and so did the score. The score was tied 64-64. My group had a secret pitch that we made from the beginning of the tryouts. We make different hand signals for other ones but this was the one. I made the hand signal and the pitcher was terrified. I threw it and closed my eyes. I was crying on the inside. I didn't here a hit so when I opened my eyes I looked around. The other teams fans were not cheering. Neither were they. I thought to myself did I win the game? Then I looked at the pitcher. He caught the ball. It seemed as if my teams fans didn't start cheering until they knew that we had won. After the game my mom took me and my team out for hotdogs and fries. They were delicious! &quot;Thanks a lot mom!&quot; &quot;Your welcome.&quot; All my friends started going home and I went to bed and dreamed about the game over and over.]]>

Before she could respond Will answered his own question. &quot; I think I'll ask Jake,Bob,Anthony and Parker over.&quot; Will's fingers flew across the phone so furociously that he had to re-dial at least twice for each number. &quot;Hi~guys~this~is~Will~it's~really~rainy~here~at~my~house~I~don't~know~if~it's~bad~at~your~houses~but~I~really~want~you~to~ come~over~right~now~please~okay~bye!&quot; Will said at top speed into the phone each time he called one of his friends. And each time they responded,&quot;Okay Will, Slow down buddy. I'll be there right away, I've been getting kind of board anyway,bye!&quot; Of coarse, none of them got to Will's house right away, considering all four of them lived in a whole different town than Will. It took about thirty minutes just for Bob to get there, and he lived the closest to Bill. For Anthony to get to Will's house it took a whole hour, ( He lived the farthest away).Once all of Will's friends got to his house, the terrible rain had stopped and they had received the dreaded and very much expected news that the championship game had been canceled due to all of the mud. &quot;What should we do now?&quot; Jake wondered aloud. That's when the boys realized that the same mud that was at the baseball fields, was also in Will's backyard.That's when they all decided to do what boys do best: Get Dirty.]]>

Will got a piece of paper and wrote down the ideas. Jack sugessted they play hide-and-seek. Will wrote that down. Pete sugessted that they draw things that they like. Again, Will wrote that down, too. Adam sugessted baking brownies, and Will wrote it. Lastly, Henry said they should put on a play. When they played hide-and-seek, Will and Adam won because Will knows every good space in the house, and Adam comes over at least 4 times a week and memorized the house like the back of his hand. Henry had the best drawing of an Xbox console and controller. Jack had some pretty good cooking skills and the brownies were exploding with taste (and fudge) in their mouths. And Pete goes to a drama class, so he had the best anunciation and articulation. The boys had so much fun that they forgot that the game existed. Then the phone rang. Will's mom answered in, and when she hung up, she said &quot;Good news, boys. The game isn't cancled! You can still play. All the boys piled into the car and cheered in praise. Will's mom droveoff towards the field just as a rainbow was forming]]>
