                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[An example from Source #1 explains that the farmers produce maize, beans, vegetables, and fruit. This example supports the idea of the Aztecs ate very well because it includes lots of different varieties of foods that serve thousands of Aztecs. Another example also comes from Source #1 , the Aztecs also ate lots of meat and fish. Unlike most civilizations, the Aztecs don't keep their animals for meat. Although they still went fishing and hunting so they can keep a large variety of dishes. The Aztecs also eat birds, insects, and lizards. This is considered supporting to the claim because there are many different dishes of all sorts and not only one type of meat or one type of fish. From Source #3, it says that the Aztecs are big on farming, it states that using the traditional method that they can get five to seven rounds of crops each year. This supports the claim because, if they can grow so many crops they would either store it or give it to all the people. Many of their crops are edible such as the maize, beans, corn and etc. This means they have different foods to choose from and a big range.]]>

In Meat, Fish, and Other Treats, it says that they can eat a wide range of dishes, like fish, duck, turkey, deer, parrots, owls, eagles, lizards, frogs, birds' and insects' eggs are eaten quite often. This proves that the Aztecs had large diets, and ate very much. In Source 2, Producing Food, it states that they ate tomatoes, avocados, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples, chocolate, pumpkins, and peanuts. The section Preparing Food, says that the Aztecs bought fresh food in the markets everyday. This also proves that the Aztecs were big-eaters. In Source 3, it says that the same chinampas feed the hundreds of thousands of residents of the great Aztec Empire of Tenochtitlan for hundred of years. If they did that right now, they could provide food for the entire population of Mexico City, all 25 million of them for 30 years. This is evidence that the Aztecs ate very well.]]>

As stated in the heading &quot;Food and Drink,&quot; Aztec food is hearty, wholesome, and filling. These foods contained, peppers, tomatoes, leeks, squashes, watercress, and artichokes. Also, the Aztecs would use onions, garlic, chilis, and different herbs to make their meals even more tasteful. In Source #2, it provided ther edvidence that because of the chinampas, the farmers had rich soil to provide the Aztecs and themselves with great, flavorful food. The Aztecs would also go fishing and hunting for fresh meat to eat. The first example supports the idea that they enjoyed a good diet by providing you with the information of how the food is described. For example, the food is hearty and wholesome probably meant that the food was very delicious, and that it was so good that they ate too much, and became full. The second piece of evidence shows that the farmers had rich soil so the crops would taste better once they were were harvested. Finally, the third example shows that the Aztecs would go out to hunt for fresh meat and fishing. This means that they would take the time to hunt tasty meat and cook it over the warm fire for a meal. All in all, the Aztecs had a very good diet, according to all the crops produced from the rich soil.]]>

My last example of the Aztecs having great meals is that every day the Aztec people would buy fresh food in the markets(&quot;Preparing Food&quot;[Source #2]).

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Source #1 states the Aztec food is hearty, wholesome, and filling. To enjoy a good diet means that you're eating healthy, wholesome food that fills you up and Source #1 provides evidence of that through the long list of crops they ate: corn, chilis, onions, squashes, artichokes, you get the idea. Not only did they eat vegetables, but they also had duck, turkey, deer, parrots, fish, etc. In Source #2, the Aztecs ate mostly fresh food, but also preserved food. When they farmed, they produced crops in large numbers from all the chinampas they made and from the fertile land. Their bulk food was corn and they used it to make corn flour for corn tortillas. They drank alchohol too, but their favorite drink was choclatl, which was a spicy hot chocolate. If the Aztecs did not enjoy a good diet, then they wouldn't have had to preserve because they would eat it before then and wouldn't have fancy drinks like hot chocolate or Octli. In Source #3, their chinampas were fertilized with natural fertilizers. Natural fertilizers are the best for growing because if you take Miracle-Gro for example, you have the possibility of feeding the plant too much. But with natural fertilizers, you can't overpower it. If the land isn't fertilized, then the crops won't be good. In the Aztecs' case, their land was fertile and it would be ridiculous if their crops didn't turn out well. A good diet means good, fresh food.]]>

This means that they had corn for almost everymeal and it is a vey healthy food so they have a good diet.Another reason why this is true because in source 2 it states&quot; ...only people abov the age of 30 were allowed to drink alchohol.&quot;. this means that if only people above thirty could drink alchohol People that were in there twenties that had kids( family) wouln't give it to the parents or the children,so they are helthier because they don't drink alchohol.

Tomatoes, avocados, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples, chocolate, pumpkings, and peanuts were also important in their diet.&quot; This supports the claim because it shows that they ate many delecacies in their time and had lots of food to go around. 'Preparing Food' &quot;The Aztecs ate mostly fresh food, which they bought in the markets every day. They also preserved food to keep it from spoiling. The Aztecs did not use ovens but cooked their food on open fires. Ordinary people usually drank water, but for important Aztecs there were other drinks. A favortie was choclatl, or drinking chocolate, made form the beans of a cacao tree.&quot; This evidence supports the claim because it shows that the Aztecs had to keep their food fresh, and how there were drinks that were delecacies. 'Turning Corn into Flour' &quot;Turning the corn into flour was women's work and took many hours. The kernels had to be scraped off the cobs and soaked overnight in water mixed with limestone, to loosen the outer skins. In the morning the kernels were boiled and the skins removed. They were now soft enough to be ground into flour by crushing between a grooved stone roller (a manos) and a small stone slab (a metate).&quot; This evidence supports the claim because it shows that farming corn can also get you bread and other grain products.]]>

From source two it say's,&quot;Thanks to this treatment, the soil on the chinampas was so rich that farmers could grow up to seven crops each year.&quot; They can grow seven crops for each year for only one chinampa, think of hundreds that accomplished that, that harvest could feed the whole empire. They enjoyed a good diet because not only are they aquiring a wide variety of crops but these crops are being multiplied by the hundreds so they would have full stomaches for the rest of the year. In source three, it say's,&quot;In 25 days he could have a head of lettuce.&quot; Think if he got a head of lettuce in 25 days froma small space, think of what he could gain, maybe 1000 heads of lettuce depending on how good the soil is. They probably would have enjoyed a good diet because lettuce is good for you and farming is year round, har back breaking work so you would need to be in peek physical condition.]]>

The first reason I believe this statement is correct is in Source #1, under Mostly Maize, it sates that the Aztecs ate tortillas very frequently and usually stuffed them with beans or vegetables. This proves that the Aztecs ate healthy because beans are protein and your body needs protein. The second reason I believe the Aztecs ate healthy is in Source #2, under Preparing Food, it states that the Aztecs ate mostly fresh foods. Fresh foods are good for you and because they aren't old or rotting there is less of a chance of you getting sick from them. The last reason I believe the Aztecs ate healthy is in Source #3 it states that the Aztecs farmed with natural fertilizers. The natural fertilizers don't have chemicals in them so there is less of a chance of them harming you or getting you sick.]]>

My second example why is because the next topic talks about growing crops. This supports my idea because the Aztecs talked about corn and how it was their favorite food to eat. Which shows that they probably eat alot of it. My last example why is because the other topics shown talks about food which means the Aztecs eat alot. This shows why I think Aztecs ate very well.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[The Aztecs ate very well because they had a good variety of food that was grown and hunted. For example in source #1 it says, &quot;In spite of the difficult weather, The Aztecs grow a wide range of produce. Farmers grow maize, beans, vegtables, fruit, and even flowers. all farming is done by hand using wooden tools. The Aztecs have no wheeled vehicles and no farm animals to help them. Most farming takes place on the fertile coastal plains, but people in the mountainous regions build terraced fields along the sides of the mountains.&quot; How this example supports the idea that they enjoyed a good diet is because it syas that they had a wide range of produce and it was alot of food for them to enjoy. The next examle that I have that explains that the Aztecs ate very well is in source #2. It says,&quot;The Aztecs ate very well. Their most important food was corn. Tomatoes, avocados, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples, chocolate, pumpkins, and peanuts were also important in their diet. These fruits and vegtables were all new to the invading Spaniards, but they soon learned to like them. Spanish ships carried many of these foods back to Spain, and they soon became part of the European diet.&quot; This example supports the idea that they enjoyed a good diet because it says that these foods were important in their diet so they must have enjoyed it if it was important in their diet. The last example that I found was in source #2 and it says, &quot; Aztec food is hearty, wholesome, and filling. Most meals include a tortilla- atype of pancake made from maize flour- that can be wrapped around a range of fillings.&quot; This is a good example that supports the idea that they enjoyed a good diet beacuse it says in the beginning that the Aztec food was hearty, wholesome, and filling so they must have enjoyed it.]]>

Usually people drank water, but for important Aztecs there were other drinks. A favorite was choclatl. Octli, was an alcoholic drink made from the sap of the maguey cactus, it was drunk by older Aztecs. This example shows they enjoyed a good diet because they made different kinds of drinks. I found this information from the section Preparing Food. There most important food was corn. But tomatoes, chocolate, pumpkins, avocados, chilies, peppers, sweet potatoes, pineapples, and peanuts were also important to their diet. This example shows they enjoyed a good diet because, that is a large variety of foods that are healthy for your body. I found this information from the section Producing Food. Aztec women worked to turn corn into flour, it took many hours. The kernels had to be scraped off the cobs and soaked overnight in water mixed with limestone, to loosen the outer skins. In the morning the kernals were boiled and the skins removed. They were now soft enough to be ground into flour by crushing between a stone roller and a small stone slab. This example shows they enjoyed a good diet because, the women took a large amount of time just to make flour for their families. I found this information in the section Turning Corn into Flour.]]>

In the same Source later on in the paragragh it states that &quot;Aztec food is hearty, wholesome, and filling.&quot; In that paragrapgh it also says most meals include a tortilla a type of pancake made from maize flour and can be wrapped around a range of fillings. Aztecs use plenty of fresh ingredients and LOVE spicy food. In Soucre #3 it states that Aztecs with the help of chinampas they could grow 5-7 rounds of crops every year and they had no problem feeding hundreds or thousands of residents of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan for hundreds of years. All the examples show that the Aztecs enjoyed a healthy diet because they had this food it states that they had whole, hearty, filling meals.

As well as fish, duck, turkey, and deer, the Aztecs eat parrots, owls, eagles, lizards, and frogs.&quot; That means that they were most likely always able to catch at least one of these animals each time they went hunting. Another reason I know this is in Source #3 it says &quot;They could provide food for the entire population of Mexico (all 25 million of them) for 30 years.&quot; That means that thay had a lot of food if they could feed that many people.

In this section it says that the Aztecs ate &quot;mostly fresh food&quot;. This is an example of how the Aztecs ate well, because it shows that they were eating food that was fresh and new, and not having to keep it stored, and than eating preserved food. Another example of this is under the section &quot;Growing Crops&quot; where it states that the most important food crop was corn. This connects to the second paragraph of the source, which states that corn was the Aztecs most important food. This is important because if it is their most important, or most valuable crop, it probably means that they grew a lot of it. This would be good because like mentioned, it was their most important food. A third example of how the Aztecs ate well was found under the selection title &quot;Building Chinampas&quot;. Here it says that chinampas could grow up to seven crops a year. This would be important because they would be able to have a good supply of food, so that if something did happen, they would have some food as a back-up.]]>
