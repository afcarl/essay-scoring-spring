In Source #4, a student at Dublin University, Shane Fitzgerald, posted a fake quote in the Wikipedia article of the recently deceased composer, Maurice Jarre. Many different media outlets used the quote in their stories that reached all across the world. Fitzgerald did this to show how false information can be spread and printed a million times and it will eventually be seen as the truth. He proved his point when even The Guardian, a famous British newspaper, ran the quote in their obituary. Professors at Middlebury College in Vermont have noticed that students often cite Wikipedia as a source in their papers. However, the student's in Neil Water's Japanese history class were fed wrong information which led them to get bad results on their exams. The college has now banned the students from citing Wikipedia as a source for information (Source #5).]]>

In source #4, A student from Dublin University fabricated a quote &quot;by&quot; composer Maurice Jarre, &quot;A full month went by and nobody noticed the editoral fraud. So Fitzgerald told several media outlets in an e-mail and the corrections began.&quot; This information went undetected because of Fitzgerald claimed that &quot;[Media outlets] were under pressure to produce news instantly&quot;. So why did this misinformation spread? One idea is that the writers had only glosed over the cite-less quote. The quote itself neatly fit into the thoughts of a composer; that he &quot;'there will be a final waltz his head only he could hear.'&quot; This quote seemed so likely and so real that pressured editors decisively decided to publish it. The quote was shocking enough to attract attention, while still maintaining a guise of truth. So, it was accepted as &quot;truth&quot;. In source #2, Wikipedia at one point in time had &quot;[Wikipedia] reached 3 million entires... more than 10 million users contributed to that milestone...&quot; Unfortunately, The shear amount of users both helps and hurts accuracy of the articles on the website. Some articles with questionable material have a banner that states it needs more sources, along with a &quot;citation needed&quot; box after some material that is questionable. However, some of these notices are old, and like in the previous example, can go unnoticed. Information that is more subjective is often the problem; how can we decide if a country is overall in bad shape or how terrible Huricane Katrina is? Also, certain data that requires strenous work, like populations of people in a certain area, can change very quickly without notice. Since certain countries cannot take Census or take it every few years, it makes it that much harder to have good, valid, and up-to-date data that isn't subject to question.]]>

In relation to the capability of contacting other individuals from anywhere across the world, the Internet has given society a way to spread news like Southern Californian wild fire. Even a single spark that lasts a few seconds can ignite an enraging flame. Similar to the relationship between a spark and a fire, misinformation on Wikipedia can spread in seconds thanks to modern day technology. However, the ones guilty for this spread of information are the users, not the source itself. For instance, journalists are extremely &quot;eager for a quick, pithy quote&quot; when they are trying to meet their deadlines on articles, as stated in Source 4. In their rush to finish their assignments and publish news before their competitors, journalists overlook the quality of their work. The institution of Wikipedia isn't to blame. The spokesman himself even stated that &quot;if you see that quote on Wikipedia, find it somewhere else too.&quot; This spreading of misinformation occurs because of a lack of professional ability from the users.]]>

Source 4 states that it is not that the inaccurate information is corrected, but, &quot;It was journalists eager for a quick, pithy quote that was the problem&quot; (source 4). The journalists got hold of a false quote posted on the Wikipedia page about French composer Maurice Jarre right after his death, even though it was eventually taken down. Once something is made public though, it will spread around the globe quickly, making it too late for editors to stop the misinformation from spreading. When leaked by the first journalists who saw it, they decided to include it in his or her obituary of the composer, but the quote also found it way onto other websites online. Furthermore, when students at Middlebury College, Vermont were cramming for an exam they looked on the internet for answers. The professor figured out that, &quot;The obscure, though incorrect, information was from Wikipedia...and the students had picked it up cramming for his exam&quot; (source 5). The students were a large group and used Wikipedia to study causing the false infromation to be spread quickly among the tudying students students. In both examples, the information was spread quickly due to the fact that people were in a rush to gain knowledge or information that was inaccurate before it could be taken down by those that take out information that is wrong.]]>

This is convenient, but has the potential to become dangerously misinformative. A small experiement was conducted by Shane Fitzgerald to observe just how far a piece of incorrect information could spread when attention was drawn to the subject it concerned (Source #4).

According to source two, misinformation can spread quickly through Wikipedia due to how simple it is for someone on the internet to edit an artile or biography. Vandalazation is a large issue for the website along with its biggest concern, &quot;Wikipedia has been concerned about it's accuracy&quot; (2). Another reason it is so quickly passed on is because the company Wikipedia doesn't seem to notice unacurate edits that the public makes. Source four summarizes that a university student jokingly added a false quote to a Wikipedia page, yet &quot;A full month went by and nobody noticed the editorial fraud&quot; (4).]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Source 4 describes a story of a sociology major who did an experiment by making up a quote, which he claimed came from the famous Oscar-winning actor Maurice Jarre. Though the &quot;1,500 volunteer 'administrators' and the wider public to spot bogus additions did its job, removing the quote three times within minutes or hours&quot; (4), it was not removed &quot;quickly enough to keep some journalists from cutting and pastint it first&quot; (4). Consequently, the misinformation went viral, spreading extremely quickly all over the internet. It was not until Shane Fitzgerald reported to the media that the public realized the quote was phony. In another mishappening, &quot;half a dozen students... asserted that the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-century Japan&quot; (5). According to Professor Neil Waters, this information was wrong as &quot;the Jesuits were in 'no position to aid a revolution'&quot; (5). In both these cases, it was likely that students and journalists simply believed that the information was accurate because it was posted online. This is similar to Milgram's experiment where people were told to give &quot;learners&quot; shocks for incorrrect answers to questions. The shocks were not actually real, but the participants did not know this. Even when the shocks became dangerously high, almost all the participants followed through simply because an authoritative looking man in a lab coat asked them to do so. The conclusion of this experiment was that people tend to trust authoritative or official-looking figures. In this case, the website Wikipedia looked official, consequently making people believe that it is always accurate.]]>

For example, a student at Dublin university, Shane Fitzgerald, performed an experiment on the Wikipedia and jounalists (source #4). He did this by posting a poem that Maurice Jarre, a French composer, prosed onto Wiki. But in actuality, he composed the poem. The result was that Wikipedia editors deleted the fake poem as quickly as possible, but they weren't quick enough before journalists saw the poem and used them in their magazines. The lesson to be learned here is that Wikipedia is a reliable source, as long as one can find the primary source somewhere else, according to an editor at The Guardian magazine. Vandalism and lack of accuracy occurs within Wikipedia, with &quot;2.92 mistakes per article for Britannica and 3.86 for Wikipedia&quot; (source #2).]]>

Misinformation can be spready quickly because articles gradually increase tremendously over the time Wikipedia was created. As the years went by, articles were translated to many languages usede throughout the world to attract more people to visit their website (source 2). If Wikipedia gave false information, then the millions of people who visit Wikipedia daily will believe in things that are not true. A study has shown that another competing encyclopedia, Britannica's is more accurate than Wikipedia by almost one less mistake. Wikipedia may get misinformation due to the ability to let anyone edit the article about the subject whether it is right or wrong (source 4). A person randomly quoted a deceased person and if he had not came clean about what he did, he would of made up a quote for someone and everyone would believe that he said that (source 4). It seems as that if it sounds right, it will be true if you put false information. People should not use Wikipedia as their primary source in case of false information. Students who are enrollede to Middlebury College were found using Wikipedia to study for their exam. Unfortunately the website gave misinformation and caused students to not do well (source 5).]]>

As proven by Irish student Shane Fitzgerald, not all the information you read online is to be true. In source 4, the university student tests out an experiment, seeing whether or not the credibility of Wikipedia is solid. As quoted from source four, &quot;he said it took him less than 15 minutes to fabric and place a quote calculated to appeal to obituary writers without distorting Jarre's actual life experiences.&quot; In addition, as listed in source 5, &quot;half a dozen students in Neil Waters' Japanese history class at Middlebury College&quot; referred to false information on the research topic they were assigned. The students cited their sources, though inaccurate, explaining to their professors that high school teachers allowed such a practice. In addition to students, high school teachers are also verdicts in allowing their students to rely their whole essay on one source. Because high school students are constantly using wikipedia and other encyclopedias as sources throughout their four years, most students tend to bring that trait to universities. Even the most intellectual students have a hard time writing papers or projects without the help of an uncredited source. Even Wales, the cofounder of Wikipedia and chairman emeritus of its foundation said that &quot;students shouldn't be citing encyclopedias.&quot; Wales implies that even the most information filled website can have flaws that aren't going to benefit the readers all the time. (Source 5) Such reliability on a website can flaw many students' assignments as well as tests. Searching up a topic on Google can simply bring everyone to a variety of websites, most of which list Wikipedia as a primary website. Based on my own experiences, many people tend to click on the first few sources because it is simply &quot;easier&quot; than to scroll down and look for more credited informational websites. This is why the university students all found and used the same information---it was easy. Without checking its credibility, they presented these so called &quot;facts&quot; in their essay, which brought upon worry to Waters, their professor.]]>

With a lot of people social media and internet dependent, it is simple to vandalise and lie to them because they don't know if it's true or not. For example, a student in Dublin decided to post a fake quote which was a phony one, but unfortunately, it was believed by a lot of people. He even said &quot;I was shocked at the results form the experiment&quot;(Source #4), which meant that he thought he woulds get caught with making up a false quote, but people were so naiive and gullible to believe that it was actually written by that poet. Fitzgerald, the Irish student, had to finally admit that it was fake for people to finally understand. Another example that is given is that the articles are usually written by users, not real traditional experts. &quot;Can the information on Wikipedia be trusted? When it pertains to cancer, at least, yes.&quot;(Source #3) is sort of mocking Wikipedia because it's trying to say that Wikipedia is mostly an undependable source of knowledge.

For example, in source #4 titled &quot;Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote&quot; Dublin university students Shane Fitzgerald confirmed that,&quot; He was testing how our globalized, increasingly Internet-dependent media was upholding accuracy and accountability in an age of instant news..&quot; He also stated that, &quot;Even though administrators at the free online encyclopedia quickly caught the quotes lack of attribution and removed it, but not quickly enough to keep some journalists from cutting and pasting it.&quot; Paragraphs 1 and 4 These quotes clarify how any user belives what the information posted on the article and don't realize where it came from or whom posted it. Furthermore, anyone who uses the Wikipedia as any type of reliable source does indeed believe almost everything that is on it, but do not realize who posted it or if there is a link as to where the information came from. In source #3 titled &quot;Trust Wikipedia? Yes, when it comes to cancer anyway&quot; indicated that, &quot;But that content's realiability should be met with some skepticism. After all, it's created by users, not traditional &quot;experts.&quot; Paragraph 3 This quote explains how misinformation can spread quickly due to the lack of information on where or whom posted it.

When Shane Fitzgerald fabriacted a quote and posted it on Wikipedia;s article on Maurice Jarre, his study on how Internet-dependent media had become showed that journalists who used the quote were &quot;eager for a quick, pithy quote&quot;(Source 4). That conveniency of Wikipedia may be able to provide information for curious people, but it also provides information for those looking for easy information. The eagerness for easy information in thousands of people around the world cause this widespread of misinformation. In Middlebury College, a Japanese history professor found that half a dozen students had incorrectly asserted that Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion on their exams, information they found on Wikipedia (Source 5). When desperate for information like these college students, much of the world tends to rely on Wikipedia for the answer to questions that they could find on more reliable websites. Like the journalists, these students were too dependent on WIkipedia to help them achieve the gathering of knowledge. This laziness seen in not only college students,but many other people show how fast false information can be spread.]]>

Since anyone can post and edit the articles on the website, it can be quite confusing to know what is actually accurate. Shane Fitzgerald, a college student, tested how many people noticed the credibility of a phony quote he posted on the Wikipedia page of a famous composer soon after the composer's death (Source #4). The media who used the fake quote did not realize the mistake until a month later when Fitzgerald announced the fraud to the media. Since the accessibility to the website is easy, many students cite the information on Wikipedia as a valid source without checking its accuracy (Source #5).

Another instance when wikipedia has failed to provide credible information was discovered by the professor of Neil Waters' Japanese history class at Middlebury College (5).

However, some of the content can be inaccurate. This is shown in &quot;Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media with Fake Quote&quot;. where Pogatchnik experiments with today'sincreasingly internet-dependent society and accuracy of news. After posting false information, Pogatchnik was surprised that even though Wikipedia editors removed the content from the page, his information was still seen on a variety of news sources and blogs. This proves how accuracy can be overlooked because of the huge coalition of support Wikipedia offers. In Source #5, Cohen also discusses the effect of one enormous online databases. When a school in Vermont, finds out that a substantial amount of students used inaccurate information from Wikipedia to support a claim, the school took action. The publicity of Wikipedia has allowed students and adults alike, to access information in a swift, efficient manner, despite the correctness of the information. Wikipedia has shown that its can be spread in all social environments, and people must be mindful of the uncommon misinformation spread from the online encyclopedia.]]>

For instance, Source 4 states that a false quote became viral on the internet through Wikipedia. This could have happened because users who read Wikipedia articles might believe most pieces of information even if it is false. Some people who are not aware that the internet contains lies may also spread this false information, further exascerbating the lie. Another example of misinformation comes from Source 5, where college students relied on Wikipedia as key facts for their exam, which ultimately hurt them because they were lies. This might happen because students commonly need an easy source of information, and Wikipedia contains articles about almost anything, even if they might be false.]]>

Many times it can be helpful, but other times it can mislead people into spreading lies and incorrect historical facts. For this reason many students and media corporations have printed out incorrect information. This causes the spread of wong information. A similar case of misinformation being spread to many is found in Source #4, when a Dublin university student posted a fake quote on Wikipedia and many used his fake quote when conducting their own research then printing it out for thousands to see in a matter of days. This incident is a result of human error that comes from a researcher who maybe under time constraint or just lazy. Time constaint and lazyness causes this because if the researcher hadn't been lazy he/she would have researched more into the &quot;evidence&quot; being shown, and found out if it were ledgitament or not. Source #5 also points out a flaw that comes from the use of Wikipedia and the rapid diffusion it has on its users. In Source #5 students failed their tests do to misleading information from Wikipedia. Since this information is posted on the Internet, which in our society is only a few clicks away, Wikipedia can give misinformation to millions in a matter of minutes.]]>

In source 4, a student by the name of Shane Fitzgerald posted a phony quote onto an article for Maurice Jarre, a French composer. Shane was testing to see how accuracy and accountability fell into play in this as he puts it, &quot;internet-dependent media&quot;. Shortly after he posts this inaccurate quote, dozens of U.S. blogs and newspaper wbsites in Britain, Australia, and India post this information, without knowing of it's false intent. This information spreads quickly as people don't pay attention to quality as much as they should now adays, they just look for information. These blogs and sites didn't look for a second source for this information, and simply believed that this information was accurate, and posted news about it wihtout thought to it. In source 5, students use Wikipedia to recieve information for an exam. Along with the false information obtained by the studens of professor Waters, other schools and professors notice that students are recieving false information off of these sites, and it spreads throughout the schools.]]>

According to source 4, there are about 12 million listings on Wikipedia, and only about 1,500 volunteer editers. It could be simply that there are not enough editers to find the mistakes in every article. Also explained in source 4, the misinformation can spread rather fast, because the users of the website tend to use the information without doing a background check on the accuracy of the information. &quot;it was distressing to see how quickly journalists would descend on that information without double checking it.&quot; Also, as explained in source 5, misinformation can spread quickly due to an assignment or essay students have to complete, and they go straight to Wikipedia in order to find the information they need. &quot;When half a dozen students in Neil Waters' Japanese history class ar Middlebury College, Vermont, asserted on exams that the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-century Japan, he knew something was wrong.&quot; Even though the fact was false, students still used it on heir exams, because they thought since it was on the internet, it must be true.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[It is widely known that somethings on wikipedia are not always correct in terms of information. many examples of this can be found. One example can be seen in source four, where it talks about how Student Shane Fitzgerald posted a fake quote on Wikipedia and then, that quote became used in &quot;many blogs and several newspapers.&quot; This fast spread of information can be atributed to the fact that &quot;it took him less than 15 minutes to fabricate and place a quote.&quot; And therefore, the quote was readily avalible to the public to use and spread very quickly. Another reason why misinformation from Wikipedia may be spread quickly may be that a larger ammount of people use Wikipedia in order to find information. An example of this can be found in source 5. As source two states, there are now more than 13 million articles, so many more people are using wikipedia when they find information on a specific topic, like &quot;Niel Waters' Japanese history class,&quot; in source 5. In that source, it states that the class found incorect information on wikipedia and used it on a test. The incorect information they found had spread through the entire class, showing just how much and how quickly wrong information can be spread. These two reasons are why misinformation is spread so quickly.]]>

It was a false quote but journalist still fell for it because they didn't double check to see how accurate it was. Another example is from source #5 stating that a student from a college in Vermont put false facts on one of his exams saying that &quot;the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-century Japan, the teacher knew it was wrong and come to find out the student got the facts from Wikipedia.

For example in source four it states that Shane Fitzgerald decided to post a made up qutoe on Maurice Jarre's wikipedia page hours after he pasted. This phoney quote went up in articles all over the world and nobody noticed it was fake. A month went by with nobody noticing so FItzgerald told several media outlets through e-mail that the quote was fake and corrections began. In concluesion this shows that people put anything they want on Wikipedia and even if WIkipedia takes it down, theres still some people who will see it and believe it. Another reason people put fake information on Wikipedia is because they do not check their sources with other web pages and put what they believe is the right information on the Wikipedia page when it is really incorrect.]]>

Once Fitzgerald had wrote the fake quote many blogs and several newspapers used the quote. He said, &quot;A full month went by and nobody noticed the editorial fraud.&quot; If it is on Wikipedia it must be true right? Wrong. People go on Wikipedia to get fast information, nobody really cares about how accurate it is. The information spread quickly because once someone &quot;reliable&quot; uses it, people think it must be true. Things on the internet spread fast. Students want to get good grades and pass classes. In order to do that students have to get information and back it up. People want to get their work done quickly because of multiple reasons. They could want to go out and have fun, or they could have other homeworke, their are many reasons, but the students in Source #5 used Wikipedia and got horribly false information.

In many instances there has been problems with the information and credability on some articles. In source #4 &quot;Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote&quot; one can see how the journalism and media industry got caught up. The fake quote was used even though there was no link or source on Wikipedias website. This is one case where the misinformation spread very quickly and was used all around the world. I think this happens because people tr to be the first ones with the new head news and tried to shortcut around finding the source. They trusted Wikipedia as a credible source and the information on it which was a big mistake. Anyone who uses Wikipedia has to know that the information put on the website is not all accounted for and submitted by users and not professionals. From the research you can see that this instance is not unlikely and has happened before. In souce #5 &quot;WIkipedia on an academic hit list&quot; an article from The Tapei Times, this happens again. The information on Wikipedia was trusted by students and used on the exams when they did not know if the information is true or not. The students were cramming for the exam and were not careful to check the information on other cites to make sure it was right. The information spread quickly in the class because once one person sees it and spreads it theres no stopping the wrong information from getting around.

The explanation offered from this source states that the media is under such pressure to produce interesting news quickly that they are increasingly depending on unreliable online sources. Source #5 offers another perspective to the issue of the fast spread of misinformation: students using the online encyclopedia for research projects are using false information from the site. The source explains that students are using the site for background information, whether or not they are actually siting it does not matter; the information is still being used and falsly spread.

The problem is that Wikipedia articles are so widely accessible and available: even with the censoring and cross-checking that keeps the information accurate, it is hard to stop all of the users that get on to an article before such misinformation is removed. The Internet is available everywhere: a million people can read an article before one editor, even if that editor reads this article ten minutes after its conception. And by then it is far too late for the million people that have been misinformed and haven't bothered to check up on their accuracy. Additionally, the sheer number of articles, &quot;13 million...in 271 different languages&quot; (Source 2), prevent any number of editors from truly being able to validate every piece of information included on such a vast online encyclopedia. &quot;Obscure...incorrect information&quot; (Source 5) is not an uncommon thing: it simply goes unnoticed in the gigantic arena of the collection. But when, say, a college history class has a big test they need to cram for, these tiny obscure details spread to a point that proves unacceptable. The problem with Wikipedia is not necessarilly a large quantity of inaccuracies, but the potential effects that those inaccuracies may have.]]>

The study done by the Irish college student shows that when a topic is trending, any information found is used widely. Following the death of a famous musician, many people were looking him up to find out more about this late man. The student took the opportunity to post a page about him on Wikipedia, inserting a false quote. Within days, even hours, the quote spread quickly and was seen in newpapers and articles.

Document 4 was a source of where a Dublin colloege student added false information to a wikipedia web page and that fact ended up in other news blogs all over the U.S. He had to come forward because he truly believed if he didn't that the &quot;quote would have gone down in history&quot;(Doc. D). Due to Wikipedia's ability to provide fast and semi-accurate information to users the shut down of the cite would be &quot;close-minded&quot; (Doc. 5). The information is sometimes false, but through mass communication, the world overlooks it. The main reason for why Wikipedia has spread so rapidly is because of popular culture. One person or one group may have started the trend and it must have caught on to others.

It's the tragedy of this country that we're only nearly free when we celebrate freedom. With out the ability to question openly and find the truth, then you're ultimately trapped by whatever is keeping you from it. Although really one can argue that nothing is keeping anyone from the truth in America, that it's simply ones stick to it-ivness that keeps people from finding it, but at the heart of the matter our society not only discourages questioning but also makes it a minefield to find answers, some only available to people who wouldn't question it, cough redacted information, but oh well what am I going on about, I'm only some silly little highschoool student who likes to ask why too much. (ps we need more funding for scientific advancement, and I mean real scientific advancement, not just research for products that can be marketed, and just oh I'm so frustrated with everything, eh I guess that's the beautiful part of America, it's our job to make it what we want.

However, since it can be added to by the general public, the editors are kept busy keeping Wikipedia accurate. A 22 year old student at Dublin University decided to put Wikipedia editors and Newspaper journalists to the test by putting a phony quote of a recently deceased composer on Wikipedia. [1] Even though the Wikipedia editors removed it quickly, within a few hours, the quote showed up in several newspapers all over, including Britian's The Guardian. This happened because the journalists stumbled upon the quote without checking it's accuracy with other sources. Students in a Japanese History class at Middlebury College also took information from Wikipedia without checking other sources while studying for a test. The information they cited was wrong, as their professor was able to correct them. [2] This also happened because the students did not check for other sources to say the same thing. This can happen on any site, but Wikipedia has a notorious reputation for inacurate information.

(Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote By Shawn Pogatchnik) Another reason why it can spread quickly is because Wikipedia gives information about touchy subjects. Wikipedia is often the top search engine when it comes to doctors. Researchers at Kimmel Cancer Center also use Wikipedia for information. If Wikipedia uses misinformation, it can hurt someone in a hospital or with cancer. So, there posts are always watched closely and if there is misinformation, then it will spread quickly.

This article tells the story of a student who wanted to see how easily people would pick up on a fake bit of information that was posted on Wikipedia that was made to sound real; his test of Wikipedia and the world showed that Wikipedia caught the error much faster than the rest of the world and that the media of the world used the quote without checking any background primary sources for affirmation of the legitimacy of the quote. The key with Wikipedia is to always check a primary source along with it. In &quot;Wikipedia on an Academic Hit List&quot; by Noam Cohen it is said that university proffessors do not oppose the use of Wikipedia, or any other encyclopedia for that matter, as a starting point for researching a topic, but they do oppose citing Wikipedia as a source. Once again the key with Wikipedia is that is cannot be used as a source but as a step in the direction of finding the source that you is needed.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Misinformation on Wikipedia can spread very quickly and it is demonstrated in a few of the articles. In source #4 it talks about a Dublin university student named Shane Fitzgerald that was doing a sociology experiment to see how fast false information on the site Wikipedia could spread. There was a Wikipedia page on the French composer Maurice Jarre. Jarre had died just hours before and Shane saw his chance to do his experiment, so he posted a quote on the page that was supposedly said by the composer but was not. And sure enough within a couple of hours of that quote being on the page, journalists from all over Europe had swooped in and copied it to put in their obituaries on the deceased composer. To Fitzgerald's surprise his experiment had worked profoundly more than he had imagined. The team at Wikipedia that edits the site and checks the reliability of the entries, found the quote and erased it as soon as they found it, but some journalists had already picked up the information. Fitzgerald did release a statement saying that he was the one who posted the quote and was doing it for research purposes. His experiment shows that anything that is put on the internet will be used by people, and that it can spread like wild fire. People that use Wikipedia rarely check the validity of the information that they are receiving and just assume that whoever did post the article was being truthful about it, some people even believe that others can not just edit Wikipedia as they please. This goes to show that whoever does use a site like Wikipedia should check how valid the information that they retained is before they start spreading it to others. Also information on Wikipedia, whether true or false, may spread very quickly do to the number of users that are on the site. In source #1 it shows a graph on the percentage of adults in America that use the internet compared to the percentage of those that use Wikipedia. By 2010 79% of adults in America used the internet, and 42% of them used Wikipedia as a source. With this bulk of people using the site it's no wonder that information on topics can spread so quickly whether it is valid or not. No matter what it is the more people that see it the more likely it is that it is going to be spread, and eventually some people will even start to believe it is true if they have heard it from enough people. Misinformation on Wikipedia does spread extremely fast and those that use the site should double check the information before using it in articles or just retelling it to their friends.]]>

This was shown when Shane Fitzgerald added a made up quote to Maurice Jarre's Wikipedia page after the compser died. Many newspapers, such as The Guardian, who were rushing to deliver instant news took the false quote and published it (Source #4).]]>

Wikipedia has 3.86 mistakes per article and no one argues that Wikipedia's content is flawless (A Brief History of Wikipedia 2013). Shane Fitzgerald from Dublin University, used a poetic quote, testing how accurate the internet is. Hours after the French Composer, Maurice Jarre, passed away the information flew straight on to dozens of U.S. blogs and newspaper websites in different countries ( Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote 2011). That shows how quickly misinformation can spread throughout the world. Any information that someone may hear or read, they will remember that and usually they repeat it to other people. Also if writers find information from wikipedia, they should be able to trace it back to where it originally came from. If they are unable to complete that task, then the information they have read is possibly inaccurate.]]>

While the site maintains popularity and contains important knowledge, educators question it's reliability. Additionally, eductors notice a trend in their students gaining incorrect knowledge from this website: &quot;When half a dozen students in Neil Waters' Japanese history class at Middlebury College, Vermont, asserted on exams that the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-century Japan, he knew something was wrong. The Jesuits were in &quot;no position to aid a revolution,&quot; he said; the few of them in Japan were in hiding&quot;(Source 5). By expemplifying a majority of a class turning to the popular website and relaying incorrect information, this source hits the nail on the head. Wikipedia has become an unreliable website which still holds it's popularity today.]]>

People believed the false quote because they have become too used to believing what they read instead of checking the item's credibility.

When an Oscar winning composer died, of course Wikipedia was blowing up with views of people who wanted to know who he was and what he had done in his lifetime. So as an experiment Shane Fitzgerald decided to put a false quote on the late composer's Wikipedia page to see how fast it would travel around the world. His plan worked and anyone who saw the page believed that the quote was actually said by the Oscar winner (Source #4). Therefore anyone could put anything on Wikipedia and it could be perceived as true. In another source, it was said that college students were using Wikipedia and they were all getting the same fact wrong on a paper they had to write for class (Source #5). Middlebury College debated on whether they should even allow students to use Wikipedia as a source.]]>

In Vermont, students in a Japanese history class stated, on an exam, that the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in Japan (Source #5). In fact, the truth was the opposite. After researching this peculiar statement, Neil Waters found that the students got this information from Wikipedia. Waters made huge steps to mark Wikipedia off the &quot;credible source&quot; list, and the students would no longer be able to use it in their papers or on their exams. According to this evidence, Wikipedia can be credible, but in some cases is not and can cause major issues.]]>

Anyone could be a Wikipedia editor or article producer, but the information won't always be safe to use for reports or newspapers. In Source #4 a young college student published a quote on Wikipedia to test how fast the fake quote would get across the Inter-web. He made up a quote and put that Maurice Jarre said it. This was everywhere. Newspapers had his quote in their paper's obituary sections or in memory of him type deals.

With the technology we have, it does not take much time for a piece of information to get onto the web. In,&quot;Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote&quot;, A Dublin university student shows how quickly we trust a piece of information put on the web for public display. Shane Fitzgerald found the opportunity when Maurice Jarre passed away. Fitzgerald posted a quote he made up in Wikipedia, but said Jarre had said it. Within hours of this quote being posted, it was taken down by the administrators, however journalists had already seen and used it. After Fitzgerald allowed about a month to go by he decided he should probably tell media outlets about what had happened so they could make the corrections. Another example of misinformation was presented when Neil Waters' Japanese history class at Middlebury College was preparing for an exam. He noticed that about half a dozen students answered a question with the Jesuits supporting the Shimabara Rebellion. When Waters was noticed that the students had researched and found their answer on Wikipedia, he took it to the history department and they agreed that it could not be cited in papers or exams. This information was taken from Source #5.]]>

One reasoning why this false information might spread so quickly is because of the need for news and information now that happens without double checking sources throughout our society. &quot;The sociology major's made-up quote--wich he added to the Wikipedia page of Maurice Jarre hours after the French composer's death March 28--flew straight on to dozens of U.S. blogs and newspaper Web sites in Britain, Australia and India,&quot; said Shawn Pogatchnik in the article &quot;Irish student hoaxes world's media with fake quote,&quot; (Pogatchnik.) Another reasoning as to why false information might spread so quickly is just the lazyness of some researchers. &quot;The obscure, though incorrect, information was from Wikipedia, the collaborative online encyclopedia, and the students had picked it up cramming for his exam,&quot; said Noam Cohen in his article &quot;Wikipedia on an academic hit list,&quot; (Cohen.)]]>

This massive spreading of misinformation may also have something to do with the level of people who actively use Wikipedia.

They all studied from wikipedia, and all got the questions wrong(source #6).]]>
