You need to have many skills to be a cheerleader, such as being athetic, having the ability to do tumbling, yelling realy loud, adn being able to lift your other cheer members. It's a sport where people complete against eachother to see who is a better cheerleading group. It's not just about throwing your leg in the air, screaming at the top of your lungs, and using pompoms. You also need to be smooth like a dancer, and have the ability to lift other teams members. It takes great athleicism, and strength. I think that people should take it serously and think how you have to put alot of effort into cheerleading. Many famous people have done cheerleading in their lives and have worked hard and are fit. When cheerleading first started it was a group of people who tried to get a group to help them cheer on their team. Now it's a sport where people compete, and cheer for many reasons. Both men and women do this sport, all while staying fit and have fun doing it. They have camps and major groups who do it. It's not only for fun but also to be able to do alot of other things.]]>

She used a dictionary definition on sports and it said an athlete was a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. She also uses events like Title IX regulations which states universities to offer equal athletic opportunities for men and women. she also uses famous cheerleaders for examples. She used George W. Bush as an example since he was a famous cheerleader. She used the national cheerleading organization to claim that cheerleading is a sport. Finally she used comments from directors of a competitive cheerleading program and he says its not about cheering its about competition with other schools.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[This student has argued that cheerleading is a true sport and uses strong evidence to support his claim. He states that cheerleading must require a particular set of skills as to any other sport would need in order to actually be a sport. You must be athletic to be a cheerleader, know how to do fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, complex stunts and even having to make a pyramid with your own teammates. Not anyone can just do a simple cart-wheel and call themselves a cheerleader when there are skilled trained ones doing amazing . I know for a fact that it is neccessary to be trained or skilled at these crazy stunts in order to be a cheerleader and that it is not easy to perform gymnastic-like stunts especially when you aren't trained nor skilled. Just like any other sport, there are injuries at times when performing these excelerrating routines and should be taken seriously with extra precautions just like every other sport in the entire world when you really think about it. Flying people in the air and having to catch them without letting them fall or get hurt is no fun and games. His claim also states that you must have the grace of a dancer, the skills of a gymnast, and even the strength of a football player to excel in this sport. Cheerleading isn't just screaming and shaking pompoms. It's dedication and just as hard work as any other points.]]>

In the dictionary, it states, ''a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.'' It is mainly a competitive sport against the other team or other cheerleaders. They jump, leap, make human pyramids, and even toss another person in the air and need to manage to get that other one down safely. Many injuries are caused every year by doing these things. Cheerleading surely does use your entire body. Cheerleading is a sport that accuires skill for both pysical movement and mental. You must train your body to the point where it is limber and to the point where you can catch another person. It takes time to master a skill like that just as if you were to catch a ball. It is also mental training, because one may get tired, but to dig deeper it uses the brain. Many are able to do this and have mastered the skill so great that there are national competitions and championship events. So, yes cheerleading is a sport.]]>

Cheerleaders should also be counted as athletes since the word athlete means &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility or stamina.&quot; (Dictionary). People can see that cheerleading takes physical strength, agility, and stamina, meeting all requirements to be considered an athlete. Some examples include fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as a pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air. People don't see football players doing this yet people still don't think that cheerleading is a sport. Another reason why cheerleading should be a sport is because of support that it gets. One Pediatrician has said &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments. Also, a director of a competerive cheerleading program said &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skill of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a foobtball player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah rah rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; George W. Bush also served as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, during in his senior in during high school. We all can see that many people support cheerleading in many ways.]]>

The American Academy of Pediatrics have reported on cheerleading and said, &quot;Cheerleading should be a designated sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies... and school athletics department.&quot; There is also a National cheerleading organization.

Cheer has much to do with it besides chanting at football, basketball and many other sports events. There are dances, and tumbling which can be really extreme at times. A lot of people can say that cheer isn't a sport but have they been a base or even flown in strunts and gone to a competition where they go up against other gyms? I thought not, and they don't understand the physical trainning you go through. Lifting and holding people in the air, while the flyers don't just stand there, they are in libertys doing heel stretches, tick tocks, and double or fulls down and sometimes up.

To cheer on your team, expressing it in your body language and working to make your support shown is not shallow at all. Over the years, it has become more difficult to become a fluent cheerleader, as it requires physical strength and flexibility, and a mind that can handle frequently being tossed into the air. According to national law, sports must have coaches, practives, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization. It's main goal is to compete, as the director of a competitive cheerleading program clearly states &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing...&quot; Even court rulings have been held over the case that cheerleading is or is not a legitimate sport. During a 2010 district court case in Conneticut (Biediger v. Quinnipiac University), cheerleading was ruled out as not a sport. Later, after examining Title IX, the case was uphel in 2012, which stated that cheerleading needed more organization in order to truly become a sport. Not for lack of strength or need of skill, only that this activity needed a few rules to be counted as a &quot;sport&quot;.]]>

Cheerleaders are athletes because cheerleading requires a substantial amount of strength, agility, and stamina to pull off stunts that would be required to participate in this activity. Cheerleading has become, over the last century, a physically demanding activity. It consists of fast-paced floor routines with leaps, jumps, tumbling, and complex stunts, such as building a human pyramid and tossing athletes in the air. Second, there is a national cheerleading organization that sponsors regional and national competitions. These competitions are built solely around cheerleading much like football, soccer, baseball, etc. There are also cheer camps for young athletes looking to hone and sharpen their skills in cheerleading which is also like any other sport around.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[The student's claim about cheerleading has many reasons to why cheerleading is a sport. One of the reasons why cheerleading is a sport is because in the notes that the student wrote, he added the definition of an athlete. &quot;An athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercise, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; So basically if you are a cheerleader, you are an athlete because cheerleaders do many physical stunts like hand springs, toe touches, cart wheels and many other stunts. The evidence that the student found is really good evidence to prove that cheerleading is a sport. One evidence would be the director of competitve cheerleading program saying that, &quot;cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore, it's about competing, the boys and girls who cheer must have skills of a gymnast, grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player, cheering is more than yelling and shaking pompoms.&quot; What this evidence is proving is that cheerleaders don't only have cheerleading skills, they have skills of a dancer and skills of a football player. But then some people disagree about cheerleading being a sport, some of the evidence that the student found was the US Court of Appeals stating &quot;that cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport.&quot; Another evidence found by the student would be the 2010 district court case in Connecticut, that ruled &quot;that cheerleading was not a sport, according to Title IX regulations.&quot;]]>

A cheerleader uses all of those things when cheerleading, so they are considered an athlete. There were even famous people such as George W. Bush, former president, who were involved in cheerleading. There is also a national cheerleading organization that sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events, have high school cheer camps, and youth camps. Second, Title IX states that a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, a governing organization, and its main goal to compete. Cheerleading has coaches to teach people how to cheerlead, practices, cheerleading competitions, and has a national cheerleading organization. Therefore, under Title IX cheerleading should be considered a sport even though the district court case in 2010 ruled that it was not a sport, according to Title IX regulations. The reasons why cheerleading is an actual sport are cheerleaders are considered athletes by the definition, there is a national cheerleading organization, and cheerleading follows the regulations under Title IX to be considered a sport.]]>

Gymnasts are incredibly flexible and have to be light on their feet to perform remarkable stunts. Cheerleading does also, for cheerleaders have to lift their teammates up into the air, and have to move around rapidly to perform many cheer moves. Also, dancers are graceful and very swift. A cheerleader must be the same: they cannot be clumsy and not stumble around during a rally. They must have smooth moves and be able to stretch with no pain. Finally, a cheerleader needs to have the strength that equals that of a football player. Cheerleaders have to create human pyramids, in which they have to stack on top of each other, and also have to toss others into the air, which requires great strength. In addition, cheerleading has the same aspects as other sports. A national cheerleading organization sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events, just like games such as soccer and golf. Secondly, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions, and practices during a defined season. Cheerleading does have all the things mentioned. Thirdly, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported on cheerleading injuries--&quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; Cheerleading has been organized to better rules, and is now therefore a sport.]]>

With cheerleaders the sports team that plays during games have a better chance of winning to see the team of girls/boys making the crowd cheer along with them. But cheerleading isn't all that, it is also about competing. Cheerleaders do indeed have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player all mixed into one person. Not to mention many famous actors/congress men and women have been cheerleaders in their time, and when they showed their school spirit outside it just made them all the more likeable. There is also a bad side to cheerleading, such as injures. &quot;Over the last century, cheerleading has been envolved dramatically into a competitive, physicallly demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast pasced floor routines with leaps, jumps, and gymnastics-style tumbling, also complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air&quot; says The American Academyb of Pediatrics. They are right as well, not to mention there is a certain lack of rules in cheerleading. By lack of rules I mean that there are little to no governing bodies outside watching the cheerleaders, or school athletic departments. When cheerleaders go out to practice they are told how to do the move in question then the teacher leaves to do their own work, and when the teacher leaves they are letting down their cheering team as well as letting the students get hurt and not caring at all for it.]]>

These people who are in the hospital for cheerleading injuries have faced the worse. People say that cheerleading is not a sport, but it is. These kids are getting injured just like everyone else in the other sports are. The reason why they are hurt is because they have to do stunning tricks such as a back handspring. They need the skill of a gymnast to do that. Also they have to be strong like in football to carry their team mates up the human pyramid. They basicsally have to work harder then both footballers and gymnast. They are some what combining sports. Also cheerleadering is just not as fun as it looks. It is very competitive and a demanding sport. So, how is this not considered a sport?]]>

They are saying that you have to have strength of a football player in order to lift up other girls, but the girls who fly up (flyers) are small and do not wheigh the same amount as a heavy football player. Cheerleaders are mainly for cheering on their schools team in whatever event their school is participating in. In cheerleading you do a couple cheers and that's all, in other sports you must have a special skill such as speed or control or strength or something that isnt just waving your arms in the air or jumping multiple times. At the cheer meets im sure you do the same exact thing. You do a couple cheers and that is all. At sports games depending on which sport it is you have to run or tackle or hit a ball. I know that cheer is not an easy thig to do, however I would not call it a sport because you do not do all thethings you do in a normal sport.]]>

Cheerleading doesn't have to involve a ball to be considered a sport. According to the director of a competitive cheerleading program, cheerleading isn't about cheering for a football or basketball team, it's about competition. That isn't just the reason for cheerleading. Cheerleading can be for all those reasons. Cheerleading isn't considered a sport in the 2010 district court case in Connecticut because,&quot;cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport.&quot; Cheerleading is just like soccer, baseball, football, and basketball. The only difference is that cheerleaders don't use balls. All of the sports just named require physical strength, and cheerleading does too. This is why cheerleading should be considered a sport.]]>

However, now it has been upgraded and the cheerleaders have to do dangerous stunts, like pyramid building and tossing fellow cheerleaders in the air. Also, when you're a cheerleader, you have to be flexible and you need to work out. In cheerleading they have you jump up in the air and all of those stuff. Not only that but you need to be strong enough to be able to lift up other people when you do stunts like the pyramid. If you arent flexible, than you will be more like ly to hurt yourself.

The American Acadamy of Pediatrics agrees that it should be a designated sport because of the injury involved. All sports come along with injury, which is another quality that cheerleading has.

The first reason why cheerleading is considered a sport to most peopl is because of its modern history. Cheerleading was to boost team spirit back then, but in modern times its all about competition. In American Academy of Pediatrics report, they said &quot;cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive,physically demanding, year-round activity. The next reason, is its qualifications. You have to have the body and mind of an athlete. You need stamina for all the complex routines, co-operation to get along with your teammates, agility in case someone falls, and finally strength because the most complex stunts like the human pyramid and throwing athletes in the air. The final reason, is its now a day competition. Cheerleading is used as a unofficial sport because of a legal debate but, people still compete with eachother in cheerleading and they even make websites for the competition that show true devotion to the sport.]]>

If cheerleading isn't a sport than what is it? Its not a hobby is you have constant three hour pactices a week, and big competitions at least once a month. And this is a year round sport! So we have to work as hard as any other athlete every week, all year round. And, in all sports there are at least some injuries involved, in cheer you can twist your ankle, which is very minor, or you can break your neck if you fall out of stunt or bail in your tumbling. Now and days cheer is more than shaking pom poms and yelling, its having the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.]]>

Some cheersquads come up with their own routien to show creativity and how origanal they can be, but this could also be a big risk for the squad. If judges DONT like the performince its bad news for the &quot;cheercaptain&quot;. Now what I noticed is that not once any of these artikles did they mention the &quot;RANKS&quot; of the squad. It's kind of like the military but smaller and 3 ranks. First there's the cheercaptain, then the co-captain, and at last the squad. The captian may be in charge but she/he has to make the team happy, but most of the time they have to do what's right like cutting freinds from the squad because they aren't takeing it to heart and distracting other squad members in the middle of practice. Thats only the beginning, when it comes to compatition the cheerleading world gets intence and other teams go all out. the worst any cheerleader could do is fall while preforming.]]>

This should make cheerleading a sport just like the rest. They do amazing flips and twirls which are hard for people new to the sport. Next, cheerleading is recognized as a sport by many schools in thre U.S.. The National cheerleading organization sponsor events of cheerleading like regionals, nationals, championships, and camps.

They wouldn't be flexible as a gymnast, graceful as a dancer, or strong as a football player. People don't have the correct skill necessary to be a cheerleader. For example, not many people have great hand-eye cordination, which is why it takes that certain skill to play baseball. If cheerleading requires many special skills people may not have, why can't it be a sport? Secondly, there are national events and championships held for cheerleaders. All sports have competitions, practices, and champions. Baseball, hockey, football, soccer, and tennis all contain practice, competitions, and championships. If these factors are what make sports, then why isn't cheerleading one of those numerous sports. Cheerleaders hold practices so they can practice their flips, jumps, and human pyramids. The National Cheerleading Organization sponsers regional and sectional championships for the cheerleaders, and a team is crowned champions. So what makes sports so different than cheerleading? I don't see a difference.]]>

The dictionary definition of an athlete is, &quot; a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleading surely requires physical srength, agility, and stamina. In fact, the director of a competitive cheerleading program stated, &quot;The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; Cheerleaders are just as skilled, dedicated, and powerful as any athlete, and therefore cheerleading is a sport. Even the American Academy of Pediatrics agrees, stating in their report on cheerleading injuries, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing arthletes in the air.&quot; Clearly, a cheerleader's talents are more than enough to make them a top athlete, and to make certain the cheerleading is a sport. Plus, cheerleading has turned into a competitive sport. The director of a competitive cheerleading program proclaimed that, &quot; Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing....Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; This is true, as cheerleading has become competitive and has evolved from standing on the sidelines cheering a team to becoming a team itself. In fact, Title IX regulations state that a sport's main goal must be to compete in order to be a sport. Well, clearly, cheerleading's main goal is now to compete. In fact, the National cheerleading organization sponsors regional and national competitions and championship events. With all these competitions, cheerleading must be defined as a sport. Just as the American Academy of Pediatrics said, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated [as] a sport.&quot;]]>

Furthermore, a famous figure - George W. Bush - was head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts as a high school senior. With such as important impact in tradition, cheerleading deserves to be entitled as a sport. In addition, cheerleading is a sport because of the physical ability required. According to the dictionary, an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, ability, and stamina.&quot; Cheerleading involves all these elements, and the American Academy of Pediatrics clearly points our that &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; These components need an athlete with strength, flexibility, agility, and stamina. By all means, cheerleading does not lack any characteristics to be classified as a sport. Lastly, cheerleading can be considered a sport because of the risk involved. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, who wrote a report on cheerleading injuries, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies... and school athletic departments.&quot; In other words, the academy feels that cheerleading should be a sport so that rules can be set upon it. Mentioned by the director of a competitive cheerleading team, cheerleading is more than just cheering &quot;rah, rah&quot; and shaking pompoms - the physical stunts involved expose an athlete to harm, which equal the injury risk of any other sports as well.]]>

Well cheerleading has those requirements, therefore it's a legitimate sport. Just like any other sport, cheerleading is very competitive and requires a lot of effort. Even former president George W. Bush served as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy, during his senior year of high school and if that doesn't say enough, then ill just have to tell you more. Cheerleading isn't about cheering the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing and being the best there is. It's more then just yelling 'ra, ra, ra' and shaking pompoms, it's a lifestyle. Just like some people love basketball or football, there are people out there that love cheerleading. They love the competition, the amount of athleticism, the complex stunts, and the teamwork. It should be considered a legitimate sport. A lot of practice goes into it and it requires teamwork and friendship. Therefore, I strongly believe cheerleading should be called a sport rather than an activity.]]>

Both men and women can be a cheerleaders and also men and women can be football or basketball players so I don't see how cheerleading isn't a sport because there is a lot of evidence in this passage that shows that cheerleaders and football players do the same amount of work to do good. People who are cheerleaders need to have skills and so do football players. Even a lot of universities state that cheerleading should be a sport so it should have everything that a team has like a coach. And cheerleading was envented by guys so thats another reason why cheerleading should be a sport because both guys and girls can do it. Both cheerleading and other sports have to have very skilled players so it technically is a sport because it needs the same requirements as any other sports.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[People shouldn't underestimate the skill and athletic abilities of cheerleaders. For instance, the definition of athlete contains information that it is a person &quot;who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleaders need to be trained and skilled to be able to perform tasks the way they do. Also, cheering requires a lot of physical strength, agility, and stamina. It can become tiring, just like any sport, and cheerleaders have to have the strength to go on with routines and encouraging a crowd for a sporting event relentlessly. Cheering is now causing many injuries too, and you can find injuries in pretty much any sport. The American Academy of Pediatrics reported that over the years cheerleading has become extremely competitive, physically demanding on the body, and even complex, thanks to the stunts cheerleaders are required to perform. Outsiders may consider cheering not a sport because they think they are just there to cheer on teams at a sporting event. While part of a cheerleader's job is to bring enthusiasm to a game or event, they must also be skilled to do so. Words from the director of competitive cheerleading program states that cheerleading really isn't just about cheering for other sports anymore. He states that in cheerleading one &quot;must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; It's obviously true. If they didn't have all these quialities, how would they do their job in the first place? Even the United States's former president, George W. Bush knows. He himself was head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Massachusetts while in his senior year of high school. Plus, just like any other sport, there are cheerleading competitions and even championship events for high schools and youth camps. Cheerleading has come to the point that it's just as physically demanding and competitive as any other sport out there, and undoubtedly has earned it's right as a legitimate sport.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Cheerleading is a true sport just like football or soccer. A director of a competitive cheerleading program said, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; As you can see, cheering requires strength, grace, and skills to be able to participate in a routine. Cheerleading isn't about rooting your football team on but, having the athelticism to compete. In summary, cheerleading is a true sport when it comes to atheticism. Cheerleading is not only for high schoolers but it can also be in college. A website of international cheer oganization says, &quot;cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898. Members of the 'pep club' elected 'yell leaders' to engage the crowd during the fotball team's last game of the season.&quot; Seen here cheerleading was invented at a university and was used to engage a crowd in cheering for their team. Overall, you can see that cheerleading is not play at just a high school but at a university, where it was made.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Did you know that the very definition of the word, &quot;Athlete&quot; means, &quot;A person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; The American Academy of Pediatrics reports on cheerleading injuries that &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; The effort that cheerleaders put into cheerleading is about the same amount of effort that professinal athelets put into popular sports-such as basketball, football, and even hockey. If you really took the time to see what cheerleading is really about, you would witness hardworking athelets. Not only does cheerleading require hard work, but you have to maintain a certain level of health in order to atend in any activity involving cheerleading. Some people do not believe that that rule is inforced due to the amout of injuries with cheerleaders over the last centuries. I say this because the Biediger v. Quinnipiac University-a 2010 court case in Connecticut, which ruled that cheerleading was not a sport, according to Title IX regulations; decision was upheld in 2010 by US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which stated that cheerleading needed better organizations and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport. I belive this is unfair mostly becuase all sports has to have rules and cheerleading has many, such as, you have to be at a certain stage of flexibilty to proform stunts, you are required to only practice on save equitment, ect. Some people just say things without researching what the are arguing about. In conclution, cheerleading requires alot of focus, effort, and boundaries. Without these three things, then you con consider it as not being a sport, but ass you can see, that is the root of cheerleading. Everyone need a chance and a fair balance on what they love to do. So if you really love cheerleading and hate unfairness, go out there and try to make a change.]]>

We have as much strength as football players, plus we are more flexible and agile than they are. THe dictionary says that an athlete must be a person that is trained in games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. Cheerleaders have all three. We work hard for weeks on end to go to a competition to be the best cheer team. Cheerleading also has an equal or more amount of injuries than football. We can get injured doing floor routines with jumps and leaps, when we do tumbling, and when we perform complex stunts like throwing other cheerleaders in the air. We use just as much energy and strength as &quot;real sports&quot; do, so why shouldn't cheerleading be considered a sport? CHeerleading also meets all the requirements for a sport. According to Title IX regualtions, a sport has to have coaches, practices, a defined season in which they have competitions, a governing organization, and its main goal must be to compete. CHeerleading has all of that. We have coaches who push us to our breaking point and force us to be the best that we can be. We have a season during which we go to school, state, and national competitions. Plus, our main goal isn't only to compete. Our main goal is to win. If cheerleading meets all of the requirements for an activity to be a sport, then why isn't it considered a sport? Just as the director of a competitive cheerleading program said, &quot;The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. CHeering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; We cheerleaders work at least four days a week, every week, for months to do the best we can in competitions, just for the people in today's society to say that cheer isn't a real sport. No where's the fairness in that?]]>

It also says that they dont just yell and just shake their pompoms. Now they compete against teams which is what you do in a sport. It says they even have cheer camps like they do for sports. They can also get scolorships for cheerleading like sports. For something to be a sport you it needs practices, coaches, competitions durring a defined season, and need to compete and you have all of that in cheerleading. The definition of athlete in the dictionary is a person trained or skilled in exersises, or games requiring physical streangth, agility, or stamina. In cheerleading you need to have strength, agility, and stamina to through someone in the air and catch them. Also to do flips in the air.]]>

Well, cheerleading has all of those things in its sport. It has practices, competitions and a governing organization. Cheerleading isn't some girls game anymore, it's a real, live, hardworking, enduring sport! Cheerleading is considered a real sport to so many people. Most people believe that cheerleading should be considered a sport because, as said by the American Academy of Pediatrics, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; To me, this means that people want cheerleading to be a sport, so that those who cheerlead have rules and regulations to follow. So parents want their kids safe, so they want to put rules in place that they have to follow that way they are safe and won't get hurt.]]>

For example at the beginning of the students notes it says that in the Dictionary it defines an athlete as &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Which cheerleading can be classified under because it does require physical strength as well as training beacuase if you didn't train you wouldn't be strong enough to throw people in the air and create human pyramids. In the students notes it also states in the students notes how a Director of a Competive Cheerleading Program said cheerleading isn't about cheering for football and basketball teams anymore it's about competing. Which in the Title IX regulations which requires Universities to offer equal athletic opportuneities to bothe men and women that the main goal is to compete. However it wasn't always this way it developed from a group of male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898 who started A &quot;pep club&quot; which engaged the crowd during the last football team's game of he year.]]>

It is the same with cheerleading. The cheerleading need to be flexible to do flips, handstands, and splits. These are all the same traits a gymnast needs to have to be successful. Therefore, cheerleading has the same traits, and requirements that football and gymnastics have. this is what makes cheerleading a sport.]]>

The very definition of an athlete is someone who is trained or skilled in excerises, sports or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. Cheerleading is all of that, you have to be strong, agile and you need to be trained. Cheerleading consists of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastic-style tumbling and complex stunts. For example, tossing each other into the air and catching them, that can not be easy to do, or holding each other up in a human pyramid, you have to be really strong and agile to do that. How would they get to the top of that pyramid without falling if they were not agile or strong. Former president George W. Bush went to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and in his senior year, he served as head cheerleader, so if one of our presidents was a cheerleader, it was a sport. Also cheerleding was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898.The director of a competitive cheerleading program said, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot;]]>

To be a cheerleader you also have to have a lot of stamina. As said in the American Academy of Pediatrics, Cheerleading is a cphysically demanding competitive sport. It is year round and includes a lot of fast paced floor routines along with leaps. You also should have gymnast like flexibility. It involves complex stunts in the air, and its not even about cheering for a team anymore. Cheerleading has evolved into a competitive sport and isn't just a person waving around pom poms while wearing a skirt. Cheerleading has regionals and national championship events just how football or soccer does, so what makes them a sport but not cheerleading. This is a sport, and it does have choaches and practices. The rules of cheerleading don't need to be more organized or defined because that is how it works.]]>

What is the difference between cheerleading and football? They each have coaches, practices, competitions, athletes, and a season. So why do many conclude cheerleading is not a real sport? In the dictionary, it states &quot;An athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; That is all what a cheerleader does, it is just as important and hard as football. In the 2010 Biedigar vs. Quinnipiac University case, many agreed the decision that cheerleading was not a sport, but it does have rules organization and it requires hard work. Many consider sports three things, someone with a ball, running, and an opposing team. But there are hundreds of state wide cheerleading competions. But what about important things like hard work, sweat, and teamwork. That is what makes a team, and a sport.]]>

If cheereleading was so easy, then more people would do it. Cheerleading athletically challenges people. Lastly, men and women can both do the sport. It also is a way for people to find new friends, just like any other sport. That is one of the most important reasons because thats what sports are about at a young age.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Cheerleading is considered a sport because it uses the same things that other athletes use. Other athletes have either strength or endurance, few athletes have both characterisitics. But, cheerleaders have to both of these traits. Acording to the dictionary an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleaders have all three of these traits shown throughout their sport. The main one they show is strength. They have to be strong to lift up other people. The American Academy of Pediatrics said about cheerleading that &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved drematically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-roung activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; If people do not say that cheerleading is a sport, then I do not know what is. Cheerleaders have to do all these crazy stunts that no other athlete have to do. The director of a competitive cheerleading program said that &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player...&quot; Cheerleading is almost like these three sports in one. So if you count gymnasts, dancers, and football players as athletes, then you should definitley say the cheerleaders are athletes.]]>

If you would've made the team you get to pratice, go to games, and also compete against other school cheerleading squads. Cheerleading should be know to all people that cheerleading is a true sport because, if to some people in thier opinion they dont think cheerleading is a true sport they might not give the school insurance for the injuries if a cheerleader has one. Many people support that cheerleading is a true sport such as, The National Cheerleading Organization, Biediger, and Quinnipac University. Did you also know that famous president George W.

Its not a activty and its not just something you do for fun. We actually go to competiton where we compete against other teams just like how football players have tournaments to win trophys and be number one in the states so can cheerleaders.

The dictionary says that an athlete is a person who has been trained or even skilled in exercies , has phsyical STRENGHT, ABILITY, OR STAMINA. Now, can somebody say that in cheerleading you don't need to have these things? &quot;In cheerleading you to have great upper body strength like a football player to lift your team mates up and be flexible like a gymnast to do all the flips that are required&quot;. So, if you can compare &quot;A nonsport&quot; to an actual sport then that means it has to be an actual sport. On tv have you never saw or even passed by a channel that had a cheerleading sqauds competing? Im pretty sure you have heard about or even saw the movies &quot;Bring It on&quot;, just like any other sport cheerleading is a competitive sport exactly like football, basketball, tennis etc. Out of all sports I would compare cheerleading to football the most. Just like on the field you would have to watch out for your team mates you have to make sure to hold you cheerleading team mates up enough so they can trust you. In any sport your team has to be able to trust you with any thing the let you do. I just see it as cheerleading is a sport the day during practice or during a competition and we don't break a sweat we would no long be considered a real sport.]]>

The Dictionary's definition of athlete said everything that a cheerleader needs to cheer. They need streghth to lift other cheerleaders, they need agility to be fast when they do flips and cheers, and they need stamina to have enough energy. In his notes it says that in 2012 cheerleading needed to be better orginized and have defined rules before it could be a sport. which is saying that it isnt a sport, but in theory it is. The Dictionary's defition of athlete fits as the same definition as cheerleader.]]>

In the dictionary it describes the word athlete as &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports or games requiring physical strenght, agility, or stamia. the American Academy od Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries, they said,&quot;Over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramaticllyinto a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps andjumps, gymnastics-stle tumbing, and complex stunt, such as pyramid building and tossing athletesin the air.&quot; The AAP also said, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; The Biediger vs. Quinnipac University-- a 2010 district court case in COnnecticut, which ruled that cheerleading was not a sport, accoding to Title IX regulaions; decision was upheld in 2012 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which stated that cheerleading needed better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport. The Title IX regulations--require universities to offer equal athletic opportunities to both man and women; under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during s defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal is to compete. The director of a competitive cheerleading program said,&quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strenght of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah rah rah' and shaking pompoms. Even former president George W. Bush served as head cheerleader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, during his senior year of high school. There is even a website of international cheer organization which states, cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898; members of the &quot;pep club&quot; elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crowd during the foorball team's last game of the season.There is even a National cheerleading organization which sponsers regional and national cmpetitions and championship events; high school cheer camps and youth camps.]]>

Even the American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries states that &quot;cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies and school athletic departments. When you think about it cheerleading is just as hard as any other sport. They have to undergo long hours of training and exercises just to perform for one game. The Director of a competitive cheerleading program said &quot;cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; its about competing.&quot; That is why everyone is starting to make a big deal about it. Did you know that Title IX regulations now require universities to offer equal athletic opportunities to both men and women. When you really look over all of the evidence you see that there is no excuse for why cheerleading is not counted as a real sport, some cheerleaders put in more work during a game then the players!]]>

So with that being said it means its a true sport because in my opinion most everyday activities we do is a sport. But some sports are more famous then others like basketball is more famous then dodgeball. In every sport there is a athlete and like i said before it means using physical strength. A cool and wierd fact is that former president Georg W. Bush was a head cheerleader back during his senior high school year. Cheerleading is almost like a hybrid of dancing and gymnastics. But most cheerleaders must have a good strength because if they don't they could get seriously injured. Anybody can cheer but if you go pro you have to have requirments such as like I said strength. Cheerleading has evolved from regular cheering for teams. It is now a competitive sport mainly in high school.]]>

The National cheerleading organization states that sponsers regional and national competitions and chamionship events; high school cheer camps; youth camps and then the Title regulations IX states that a sport much have coaches, practices which are high school cheer camps , competitive cheerleading program which are championship events.

I can back up this statement becuase the term althlete means &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; and we all know that being a cheerleader requires upper and lower body strength as well as flexibility. In the American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries it states &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramaticly into a competitive, physical demandin, year-round activity consiting of fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; in addition to all of this, cheerleading requires an inhuman amount of focus and precision. This all proves that not many people give ceerleaders the credit they deserve. Other people may think cheerleading doesn't have any rules or regulations like other sports, but they are wroong too! In another of the American Academy of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries it states &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; Most cheerleaders have gotten realy angry when they heard that a 2010 district court case, Biediger v. Quinnipiac University, ruled that cheerleading was NOT a sport according to Title IX regulations the decision was upheld in 2012 by the US court of Appeals for the second circuit, which stated that cheerleading needed a better organization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport.]]>

Like when football players are stereotyped to be stupid , that isnt always true. Like with cheerleadrers people think theyre just dumb blondes cheering with pom poms. The girls who are cheerleaders are usually smart and very skilled and alot they need to be able to do to be a cheerleader This whole thing of cheerleading not being a sport is just sexist. Like just because girls are usually cheerleaders doesnt mean theyre not good or not a athlete. They have to be strong and flexible and good just like the other sports.

In perspective cheerleaders are actual athletes and consider cheerleading as a sport. Athlete is defined as someone who skilled in exercising and has physical strength, agility, or stamina. Cheerleaders have all these ablities and would be defined as athletes. They use strench to toss people in the air and catch them. They are flexible and have teh ablitly to do flips. All of this requires effort and espically team work. Not only do people think that cheerleading is not a sport but only girls can do it. George W. Bush proved that wrong, he was the head cheerleader at Phillips Academy. Boys have strength, stamina and can be flexible so why not. In fact cheerleading was invented by boys. Over the years cheerleading became more about competing than cheering. There are cheerleading organizations everwhere. Cheerleading in highschools and universites have coaches, practices, and compititions so why can't it be sport.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Cheerleading is most definitely a sport. Just ask any trainers or coaches. For example, what makes other sports a sport? Football requires strength, endurance, agility, and stratigizing but so does cheeleading. We need to be able to lift people, hold positions and transfer into harder ones, plan out a safe and organized team that will look good but also make sure no one gets hurt, and compete in competitions just like sports such as soccer, basketball, and especially gymnastics. If you compare gymnastics to cheerleading, it's almost the same. You do certain skills to get rated by judges, but in cheerleading, you're in a team. Cheerleading requires all the exercise and focus other sports have. Another example is skills used during cheerleading. You do stunts such as pyramid building or tossing teammates in the air. This is just like gymnastics or soccer, except they have differences that qualify them as a different activity. Soccer has pullbacks, half time, and throw ins, but cheerleading has tumbles, flips, and splits. There is no difference between these sports, but they have individualities that make people like them and make them their own sport. Another reason cheerleading is a sport is because it requires competition. This would make cheerleading a sport because when you have something that requires talent or skill, you compete to win in that certain activity. You have categories for competitions; sports, music, academic and fine arts. Cheerleading would most definitely fall into the sports category due to the fact cheerleaders must obtain muscles and trust within each other. It would not be considered a music or fine art, or academic, but rather a sport due to the fact it is a physical activity. A director of a competitive cheerleading programs said &quot;Cheerleading isn;t about cheeing for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheeing is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; He really captures what cheerleading it. Why should it not be considered a sport if it takes everything three sports has in one?]]>

People should try out for cheerleading because it would mean that they could be apat of and activity that has been going on since 1898.

Also according to Title IX regulations-require universities to offer equal athletic opportuitiesbto both men and women; under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal must be to compete.

In the dictionary, the definition of an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exersizes, sports, or games requiring physical stregth, agility, or stamina&quot;. Therefore, cheerleaders are athletes, and ultimately participate in a sport. In fact, cheerleading isn't different than most sports like football, baseball, or basketball. It's competitive, physically demanding, and an activity involving complex exersizes and stunts. Cheerleaders must have &quot;the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the streghth of a football player&quot;. People don't understand that cheerleading is more than supporting the football or basketball team. It's about competition. Usually, if a team playing a sport is competing, they have a set of rules or regulations. But cheerleading, for some reason, doesn't have any specific rule book or governing bodies who decide what would be in it. Since cheerleading has started to evolve, cheerleaders need to be better represented. School athletic departments could be funded to support the cheerleaders and organize it before 'officially' becoming a sport. Cheerleading is not only for girls. It was invented by men, and many have been cheerleaders since then. And since society is sexist and seems to give more slack to men, having male cheerleaders should up the popularity of cheerleading and help make it a sport.]]>

Cheerleaders these days complete physically demanding and complex stunts that require more training, grace, and strength than sports like high school football. It is truly an art form. For these reasons, I believe that an activity requiring so much time and effort should be officially considered a sport. Claims made by the opposing side of the argument would be that cheerleading needs clearly defined rules and organization in order for it to be considered as a sport, but gymnastics and ice skating are both sports that appear at the Olympics, and if asked, many would be unable to state the official rules.Cheerleading is taken very seriously and should be inducted as a sport.]]>

Thats more than the punter lifts before school. Also we make actual pyramids with multiple sections. The football team only has two levels when the linemen block eachother to the ground. Lastely we always get big male cheerleaders so they can lift most of the weight. Gymnasts think they are so much better than cheerleaders because they don't have to yell stupid chants. But really we have like two girls that are just as good as them that do all the flips and stunts. People always wonder how felxible cheerleaders can be if there are some fat girls at the bottom of the period. They aren't the most athletic people but they can still bring their leg up really high. This makes the team look good during our routines. Although they aren't too athletic I bet they can touch their toes easier than the linemen. Cheerleader have very good endurance and are very good athletes. We don't have to take breaks during our routines like the potential number one draft pick Clowney, from South Carolina does when he is double teamed. Cheerleaders are all skilled at something too. Some are big and can hold up the tiny ones. The tiny ones can smile and look pretty when they are being held up. They can also yell very loudly and high pitched. Lastely the men are good at holding up the girls and getting made fun of because they are a cheerleader.]]>

It has become a competative sport that many are involved and compete in. As the American Academt of Pediatrics report on cheerleading injuries-&quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activitiy consistinf of fast paced routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastic style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; People have also grown fond of the sport, which represents America just as well as football or basketball. In fact, former president George W. Bush served as head cheerleader of Andover Phillips Academy in Andover Massachusettes, during his senior year of highschool. Nowadays, there are many school varsity cheerleading teams, not just for cheering on their football teams. These are oprganized teams that have &quot;coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, a governing organization, and a goal to compete.&quot; Many teams obtain all of these things, therefore should be considered a sport. Aslo, the National cheerleading organization sponsers regional and national competitions and championship events; highschool cheer camps; and youth camps, just like any other sport. My frined last week just went to a national cheer competition in the Virgin Islands to compete for the championships. She had to train all year long for this opportunity just like anyone would for a competition. She went to compete, and all of her hard work paid off when she won the entire competition. &quot;cheerleading is definitely a sport,&quot; she says. &quot;It requires intense training, teamwork builiding, and a whole lot of commitment.&quot;]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[My first reason of why cheerleading should be considered a sport is that the defintion of athlete is: a person who is trained ot skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring phsyical strength, agility, or stamina. If you go by this defintion, cheerleaders are athletes. What do athletes do? They play sports. Next, Title IX supports my opinion. Title IX states that men and women should get equal athletic opportunities. If more men were to cheerlead, many more people would consider it a sport. Title IX says the opposite. Title IX also states that sports must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization. Cheerleading has all of those. Therefore, cheerleading should be considered a sport.]]>

While this court case may not have ruled in favor of cheerleading, to be a true athlete, you need to be skilled and must have the physical strength to compete. Cherrleaders are very skilled because they need to be very lithe. Not only to they have to be flexible, but they need to know many sets of routines that are very hard to do. You also need to be storng, which means you need to be able to hold people up in the air for a good amount of time. It is then precieved that you need a great deal of strength. In order to be classified as an athlete, you need to be have strength, and strength is a huge part of cheerleading. Title IX says a sport must have coaches, practices, and competitons during a defined season. All cheerleading teams have coaches to teach them the moves. Second off, you need practices to get better. Third off, there are cheerleading competitions all the time. Under these rules, cheerleading is further wise noticed as a sport.]]>

From the reasearch i have done it clearly states that cheerleading is an athletic sport that both men and women are allowed to do. According to the dictionary and &quot;athlete&quot; is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excersises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; this deffention proves that cheer is a real sport. It uses flexibilty as well as strebthg and stamina. A cheerleader has to have strenth to puch their team mate up into the air but at they same time they need to posses stamina and confidence which is great for kids.Cheerleading also has a team which makes it more simmilar to actual sports. With a team these girls or boys need to rely on each other to do a god job, Lastley Cheerleading is an equal sport letting girl and boys cheer not just seeting it along to one side. By being equal the sport is more welcome and has more people instead of being out to only have bigger teams and better teamww]]>

It takes weeks of conditioning and practicing before we even get started with stunts or before we get to learn our routine for competition. I dont think cheerleading gets enough credit for being a sport because in most movies the stereotypical cheerleader is only yelling rah rah rah and shaking pom poms. It is more than that. The Director of a competitive cheeerleading program said that the girls and boys who cheer must have skills as a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Since cheerleading is all of those sports combined, I think it should be considered a sport of its own. its not just a group of people who cheer and do stunts at football games, oh no, football games are just our practices. wait until you see what we look like at competition. Lots of people think that guys cant be cheerleaders. Truth is, the inventors of cheerleading were male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898. They were members of the &quot;pep club&quot; elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crowd during the football teams last game of the season.]]>

There is not just cheerleading at football and basketball games, but people do travel and compete against other girls and boys. Other sources, such as Biediger v.

Coaches and judges are required. The American Acadamy of Pediatrics says &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot;]]>

Cheerleading should also be a sport because of how competitive it is. American Academy of Pediatrics says, &quot;Over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, phisically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; That shows that cheerleading has gotten more competitive to see who can do the best trick and which team is the best in general.

It states here and I quote, an althlete is &quot; a person who trained or skilled in excercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. The America Academy of Pediatrics states that cheerleading has envolved into &quot; a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumnling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; Using this quote we can establish that cheerleaders meet all the criterias nescary to be an athlete. What might athletes take part in? Sports. Anyone saying that it isn't, they need to look at the basic facts written in front of them. Which if you over view you will find indeed proving cheerleading is a sport. All the reasoning behind cheerleading not being a sport is not only invalid but unreasonable. The first invalid accusation is stated in Title roman numeral 1X. They said that &quot;a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during defined season, and governing organization.&quot; We have already learned from the American Academy of Pediatrics that Cheerleading is in fact a year round sport with competitions. The point of it not having governing organization is false due to the Directo of a competive cheerleading program who we have as a source. These boys and girls practice many skills just to even be consistered good. The Director of a competitive cheerleading program states, &quot;the girls and boys who cheer must have the skills ofa gymnast, grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player.&quot; This proves false anyone saying they are just &quot;cheering for the football and basketball teams.&quot;]]>

Football is a sport where there are strong guys. In Cheerleading, the boys need to be strong to left the girls and throw them in air. Cheerleading takes more hard than you think. It takes energy and guts to be thrown in the air and get caught by another person. Another reason that supports the student claim on how Cheerleading is a real sport is because sports like basketball and football; there are famous people like president George W. Bush. Besides that, Cheerleaders has competitions and road trips just like athletes in sports like football and basketball do. Some people may consider it a fake sport, but to others its real and hardworking as any other sport. Sports like football and basketball you get injured a lot, but don't think in Cheerleading you can't; people broke arms and legs in Cheerleading.

Cheerleading also requires stamina if you dont have eniugh stamina you wont be able to move at a fast pace. Cheerleading can get as competitive as other sports there can be rivals between two cheer teams in the end it all comes down to who is the best. The definition of a athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercise,sports,or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. This is exactly what a cheerleader is the strong and healthy. Im sure that cheerleaders are dedicated as much as other athletes are. Cheerleaders work as hard as athletes do and preform as hard as athletes do.]]>

I strongly diagree with what the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with accepting cheerleading as a sport. An example of what a sport must contain is in Title IX &quot; a sport must have coaches, practices, competions during a defined season, and a governing organizaztion.&quot; It also says that cheerleading is not just about chhering for the football and basketball teams anymore (which I agree with) its about competing.]]>

To do flips in the air and one-handed cartwheels ou have to to have great ability to manover in the air fats enough to to the trick that you want to do. A lot of people had tried out and failed to join the teem because they aren't ready for the extra streching in thier joints or muscle to provid this flexiblity in one or two days. Its over a long time period in which the muscles will adapt to the situation. In the students notes it said&quot;Year-around activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines wth leaps and jumos, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyrimid building and tossing athletes in th air&quot; (Student notes). Great flexiblity is required for the air catching stunts. Who says that strengh is not required to be a cheerleader? In the dictionary, the definition of a cheerleader is a person who is trianed or skilled in exercises, sports , or games requiring physicall strength&quot;(Student Notes). When a teemmate is in te air a spotter or the person that catches you when you mess up or just falling down has to have incredible strenght to catch a 110 pound girl that is falling down from 10 feet in the air. Your running around doing many tricks that for example need upper body strength and arm stregth to hold in a hand stand for more than 20 seconds and your working out.

We have practices like any other sport team would. The sport of cheer leading also requires the same amount of physical strength, or possibly more, compared to every other sport. Many important people that you have heard of were cheer leaders. Our former president George W. Bush was a head cheer leader of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts during his Senior year of highschool. Like any other sport, the goal of it is to provide structure for the player and give them a sense of hard work so when the get older, they can do great things. Obviously, George W. Bush accomplished great things with his life, being the head of his cheer leading squad prepared him to that. Some people may think that cheer leading requires no physical ability. Well, they are wrong. The American Academy of Pediatrics reports on cheer leading injuries- &quot;Cheer leading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodie... and school athletic departments.&quot;]]>

Cheerleaders have to be physically fit enough to last through an entire routine. They have to be able to support the weight of another person and catch them if needed. Most average high school students do not possess the strength that a cheerleader does. Cheerleading is physically demanding and extremely difficult. The girls and guys that cheer strain their bodies to the very edge just to entertain us. Cheerleading is also dangerous. Many cheerleaders are injured, often from falling out of lifts or landing on their foot wrong. These guys and girls are injured more often than average students. Cheerleaders have to run and exercise just as much as any football player. They have to run laps and do sit-ups and lift weights. If you claim that cheering is not a legitimate sport, you are wrong.]]>

Think about this. People say 'cheerleading isnt a legitimate sport&quot;, a cheerleader ran your country for four years! It must be something important, its not just what you think it is. A girl just hopping up and down yelling her teams name it takes effort,flexibility, and nimbleness to be a cheerleader.

But one of the most important trates they have to have is teamwork, doesnt every sport bacically have to have teamwork? cheerleaders have to keep there body fit and eat health, people who cheer have to work just as hard as football players, or volleyball players. The girls and boys who do cheer devote alot of time and energy into it, they miss school for compitions and stay at the gym very late working on new moves or practicing.To me i feel that cheer is deffinetly a sport and until people try it they will jsut keep deniying it. Everyone who does cheer is like one big family and despite the people who think we dont work at all and its easy, i dare you to come try it. see you then.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[In my opinion I think cheerleading is a real sport because it takes a lot of spirt, flexability,and teamwork to do the sport. Football players tackle one and other while running down the field carrying and thowing two pound ball while us cheerleaders, balence and throw girls in the air with difference tricks, learning new cheers and new jumps, and comming together with a bound so its a fun sport. Without us cheerleaders, the football players would only have the people that came to watch for there support and spirt.Cheerleaders would have there cheers on the side line to cheer for there team. In my opinion an athlete is a person that is really good at a skill and is competitive. Yes, football and baseball are competitve but cheerleaders are too. We have to go on the floor going against other teams for a higher place for our rutine! How about you try lifting an 120 pound girl in the air while her standing on one leg, tossing her in the air so she twirls down and you catch her in your arms without dropping her. Its not so easy as you think it is. In football you run around doing your own thing to help your team but in cheerleading your own team has to be doing the exact same thing at the exact same time or your score drops! Thats hard! thats why i think cheerleading should be a real sport like every other sport is.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[There are many types of sports in the world. Some are legitimate, and others are jokes. In my opinion, cheerleading is a legitimate sport. I think this because It requires strength, agility, and stamina. My initial reason I think cheerleading is a legitimate sport is because you need to have strength. You need to have strength in this sport because you need to do carwheels, backflips, handsprings, and even build a human pyramid. The football/baseball teams have to do just about the same amount of work as the cheerleaders have to. They have to play a sport and run to an area and the cheerleaders have to cheer them on. Clearly, cheerleading is a legitimate sport. Additionally, you need to have agility. If the cheerleaders aren't fast, then they won't be able to do have the stuff they do. If the cheerleaders weren't fast, they couldn't do cartwheels, handsprings, or build a human pyramid. The football/baseball teams also have to have agility because they have to run fast and cheerleaders have to run with them in spirit. As the evidence shows, cheerleading is a legitimate sport. My final reason that cheerleading is a legitimate sport is because you need stamina. Cheerleaders need stamina because they are jumping, waving, yelling, and cheering the whole game. The cheerleaders need stamina just as much as the teams because if they don't then they couldn't do much with the routine that they have to pull off. People would consider this as a legitimate sport.]]>

The dictionary states that an athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. Cheerleaders are needed to have strength, agility and stamina for their team mates to lift them, do back hand springs, etc. Just like gymnastics, they need to be flexible to do tricks in the air or on the ground such as back hand springs. They also need to be strong like foot ball players to lift their team mates into the air. The American Acadamy of Pediatrics said that &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumblungm and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; Sports have a season of a sport like baseball is in the spring.

If theres not then its not really a sport. I guess girls would say its a sport because they do it. But at the same time theres no pros or cons about it. Like for football theres pros and cons. The pro to it is you build muscle and skill and you can get payed millions playing for the NFL. Cons are you can get really hurt. You could get parillized, you can break a lot of your bones, and you could get head-trama. I get that you can get hurt like on a pyramid or something but not seriously.]]>

Although cheerleading was invented during a football game, it does not mean that it was only meant to be done at football games. Soon it was done in basketball games, so it most definately can be done in competitions on it's own. Cheerleading-in many situations-leads to injuries as well as any other sport. Many of the athletic abilities needed to do other sports are necessary in cheerleading. Cheerleading is in many ways alike various sports. Therefore it should be considered a sport.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Cheerleading is technically a sport, because it uses stamina, physical strength, and agility. TheDictionary states that an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Therefore a cheerleader is considered an athlete. Because of the many trials of training and/or practicing and the use of physical strength, agiolity, and stamina. Cheerleading uses physical strength alot in the routines that they do. For example a cheer team genrally makes pyrimads, or throws the flyers, and catches the flyers. The cheerleaders use alot of there strength to do so. Therefore it does use physical strength. Which helps to include it as a sport. Also cheerleaders use agility or stamina as they do theyre flips and handsprings and other things that they do. The cheerleaders need a good running start to get in the air and land the trick. Therefore it does use agility or stamina in the sport. Which also helps us define cheerleading as a sport. In conclusion cheerleading is most definitely, 100%, without a shadow of a doubt, a sport. So next time you think cheerleaders arent athletes look up the term athlete in the dictionary. Or look back at my article on why they are indeed athletes. Thanks for listening, hope you enjoyed my input on the athleticism of cheerleaders/cheerleading.]]>

It started out as being called &quot;yell leaders&quot;, they used to stir excitement and encouragement into the crowd. So yes, cheerleading didn't start out as much of a sport, but it should definently be considered one now. Cheerleading requires the skills of a football player and a gymnast combined. It also has plenty of competition and time involved. Accoarding to Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defind season, and a governing organization. It also states that it's main goal is to compete. That last part lays it all out, we do compete! The director of a competitive cheerleading program said, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about cometing.&quot; I know cheerleading is a sport, and it should be considered one.]]>

In the dictionary, it states that an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requireing physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleading requires agility, stamina, physical strength, determination. Practices are held to strengthen, teach, and improve skills that are needed when performing. The Title IX says, &quot;A sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal must be to compete.&quot; Coaches are present, practices are held, a governing organization is ready. All that is left is a designated season to compete in; as a real sport. George W. Bush, one of the former presidents, was the head cheerleader of his high school (Phillips Academy) during his senior year. If the president has done it, doesnt that make it an important event? We should follow our leaders and encourage cheerleading to become a sport. The National Cheerleading organization supports and sponsers high school and youth cheer camps all over the Nation. Shouldn't we take notice of the hard work put into cheer? There is funding, choaches, practices and skill. What more does an athlete need to develop in order for their talent to become a sport?]]>

They do a lot of exercising ,stretching,using all there strength. Just as football they don't just play they practice and pratice before having a game , well cheerleaders pratice just as well before they have a competition. They exercise before practicing, they stretch, they use a lot of there muscles when they throw the other girl's in the air and catch them.

The American Academy of Pediactrics belives it should be concidered a 'real sport' so the same regulations for other sports are required of the cheerleaders to reduce the numbers of injuries. If we look back at the definition of athlete it says that an anthlete is strong and skilled in things involving physical strenght, agility, and stanema. &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnist, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player,&quot; says a director of a competitive cheerleading program. Most of the non-debateable real sports have alot of the same systems as cheerleading. Like concider football. Cheerleading and football both have games, or competitions. They both have to be strong.

Cheerleading can be a sport, but under the regulations stated in the &quot;Biediger v. Qinnipiac University&quot; it doesn't fall under a &quot;real&quot; sport. Also under the rules of &quot; Title IX regulations any given sport has to have coaches, practices, and competitions during a designated time, which it also has. This would mean that cheerleading is infact a sport, but it really isn't a sport at the same time. It sincerely is just the way you see the sport acted out. It can be a sport for the people who want it to be or not a sport for the people who disagree. In my opinion it just matters how the activity is seen and described regardless of it being a sport or not in a book doesn't mean it can't be a sport just because someone says it isn't. My justification is that cheerleading is infact a sport even if people think otherwise.]]>

You have to build a pyramid building and toss athletes in the air. You have to be flexiable and you have to scream loud you can't always just be pretty to get in it's about if you want to be in it and if you do you won't be going around just tossing athletes and letting them fall to the ground you have to have the strength of a football player. George W. Bush was a guy and he served as head cheerleader in the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, during his senior year in high schoo. Even though George was a guy he could still be a cheeerleader. You still would have to be flexiable and all that but if you had the strengh you could also be a cheerleader. Cheerleading is evolved dramatically into competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics- style tumbling,and complex stunts. Cheerleaders can also break a leg,hand,neck,etc. but they will still cheer because it is what they love. It's not about just cheering and yelling ' rah,rah,rah' and shaking pompoms its about spirt and pride. You can just be in cheer to be popular and all but the girls and boys that cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, the strengh of a football player. Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore it's about competing.]]>

Most poeple think cheerleading is simply yelling and jumping around, but it actually very physically demanding and competative. The lagit defanition for an athlete is &quot; a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or gaes requireing physical strengh, agility, or stamina.&quot; Clearly, cheerleaders meet this definition. Needing to lift other people, toss them in the air and catch them requires emense strangth and consentration. Complex floor routines and coreography require a high level of stamina because you need to be moving non-stop at a fast pace for a long period of time. Also the Title IX regulation states that for cheerleading to be a sport, it must have scheduled practices, coaches, specific season, and the main goal must be to compete. Cheerleading also fits these regulations. Over the years cheerleading has become a much more intense sport than when it first came to be in 1898 at the University of Minnesota. Cheerleading has evolved into a competative, physically demanding, year-round sports that at the same time is very dangerous. There are many riskes involved with cheerleading such as breaking bones from not catching people or falling on people.]]>

Many other organizations and people such as , National Cheerleading Organization, the Director of a Competetive cheerleading program, went on to suggest that cheerleading is a legitimate sport. While there are many people that belive cheerleading is a sport there are some that don't. In 2010 there wascourtcase in which cheerleading was discussed, and according to title IX regulations, the decision was upheld in 2012 by the US court of Appeals, which stated that cheerleading needed better organization nad clearly defined rules. Also as metioned in the court case there was title IX regulations which - require universities to offer equal athletic oppertunities to both men and women; under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governeminhg oganization; its main goal is to be complete.

The definition of a athleteis is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises , sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. A flyer in a stunt in cheerleading must be able to have balence. The bases in the stunt must have strength to lift up the flyer. Also last the back spot must have control over the flyer to be able to catch her. Also like in any other sport, cheerleading can cause injuries. The cheerleaders can fall when tumbling or when doing a stunt. Cheerleading is more than just cheering for football and basketball teams. Cheerleaders can go to competitions and compete against different teams to see who has the best ruteins.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[An athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in a specific sport that requires physical strength, agility, and/or stanima. Cheerleading requires all three of these. It is quite similar to gymnastics, which is a Olympic sport. The fact that there is any question to cheerleding being a sport is fascinating to me because over the past century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding,year-round activity consisting with leaps and jumps, gymnastic-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air. People think the only good thing about cheerleading is cheering the football and basketball teams on at their game, It's about competing. The boys and girls who cheermust have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Ceering is more thatn yelling &quot;rah-rah-rah&quot; and shaking pom-poms. There are websites such as the international cheer orginization- explains the roots of cheering. Male student at the Univesity of Minnesota in 1898 created a pep club, and elected yell leaders to engage the crowd. If you think that cheerleading is ot a sport, there wouldn't be this big back-story to encourage young ladies and gentleman to become engaged in this sport. The National Cheerleading Association does the same thing in a different way. They sponser regional and national compitition along with championship events. This sounds strikingly similar to Nike, or Bud Light sponsering teams in upper level sports of all kinds.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Well cheeleading is a very controversial subject because men think that cheerleading isnt a sport and femalse do think this a sport here's an example. In this excerpt it demonstrates that the person who wrote this is trying to show us that this is a sport because of its athleticism that is involved and how they have to be just as tough as the football players at there high school. From his notes, they say they say that IX Regulations; decision upheld in 2012 by the US Court Of Appeals for the Second Circuit , which it stated that cheerleading needed more rules in order for it to qualify as a sport.Which i don't get because sports these days keep on adding and taking off rules that some of the rules that got the sport started that aren't even on there anymore. It also said it needed better orginizations for it to be a sport as well. In this text it says that they need to be as flexible as a gymnast in order to do these backhand springs and stuff like that which I coudn't do in a life time. I thinkl that takes some major skill in one way i believe it should be a sport. Another example that shows that this can be a sport is that cheerleading teams get sponsors and that just also proves that this is becoming a sport and that it really opens my that cheerleading may be a sport after all. Cheerleading was in fact invented by men in 1898 to cheer on football teams in the championship games they were called &quot;yell leaders&quot;. This is getting even bigger because the sponsors also saponsor youth camp to teach younger people how to cheer. Cheerleading has turned into a big thing because it isnt to cheer football or just basketball aymore its also for competitons these competetors must have the strength of a football and be a graceful dancer, this another example on why it should be a sport. To be honest i think the bigger the sport gets the more people will start to think its a sport and they have to be a strong as a ox and be as flexible as a gymnast so i truly think that cheerleading is a sport.]]>

Many people get injured during the various activities, such as leaps and jumps, tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes into the air. In other sports, people get seriously injured, or even killed playing them, in cheerleading, if you get thrown into the air, and fall on to their neck, they can break it and get paralyzed.

The American Academy of Pediatrics's report on injuries in cheerleading states that it &quot;has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity.&quot; Similarly, in Title IX, it states that &quot;(a sport's) main goal must be to compete.&quot; Title IX also lists &quot;coaches, practices, comopetitions during a defined season, and a governing oganization&quot;--all things that cheerleading has. What's keeping it from being considered a sport? According to the Connecticut court case Biediger vs. Quinnipiac University, it's the lack of organization and clearly defined rules. However, cheerleading is organized exceedingly well for not currently being a sport. The national cheerleading organization sponsors regional and national competitions, as well as championships, high school cheer camps, and youth camps. As for the rules, the American Academy of Pediatrics's report offers a different perspective: &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set for by sports governing bodies.&quot; Instead of saying that cheerleading needs to have rules to be a sport, maybe we should consider that it needs to be considered a sport to have rules.]]>

For example, cheerleaders must be willing to preform dangerous stunts. Another example, is the fact that cheerleaders have to have &quot;the grace of a dancer.&quot; The second reason is that cheerleading meets all the requirements to be an official sport. Cheerleading has an official season. Another requirement it meets is that it must have coaches and teams. Finaly, cheerleading should be an official sport, because it is competetive and just as difficult as football, softball, or any other sport. Softball demands practice, so does cheerleading. To play football, you must be strong and it is also the same for cheerleading.]]>

The girls must lift other girls in the air, requiring strength and sychronization. Back handsprings, back tucks, and layouts all require leg strength to jump off the ground and arm strength to push themselves up. Most cheerleaders have more muscle than an average high schooler. Another reason why I consider cheer a sport is because it follows the guidelines of Title IX. Cheer teams have a main coach who helps to choreograph their routines and work on skills. They practice numorous times a week for many hours to perfect their routine and learn new tricks. Competitions are held many weekends and lead up to Nationals and Cheer Worlds at Disney World. Cheer season goes on from mid-summer to April when they have their final competion. Girls and boys must also try-out to make the team, just like any other sport.]]>

The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah rah rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Next, I think cheerleading is a sport because it's fun for boys and girls. Since I am a cheerleader and not some random guy writing a few paragraphs for a test, I can say without a single doubt that cheerleading is the best 'sport' ever! Like in football or basketball or baseball, I am surrounded by my friends, not just girls, guys too. Some might say that Cheerleading is for girls, but the fact of the matter is, cheerleading was invented by a group of guys who wanted everyone to be excited during football games.]]>

They preform great feats creating shapes and forms, while simaltaniously they are constantly moving from one stance to the next, jumping, tossing, flipping, and cartwheeling. Just as many injuries happen to cheerleaders, if not more, as do the teams they often cheer on, and the rules that apply to any sport also apply to cheerleading, as clearly stated in Title IX which reads, &quot;a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organitzation; its main goal must be to compete.&quot; In cheerleading there are coaches, there are practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization such as the National Cheerleading Organization or International Cheerleading Organization. The American Academy of Pediatrics, when on the topic of cheerleading injuries, says that, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; Sounds like athletic activity, but some people would disagree like Biediger v. Quinnipiac University which ruled that cheerleading was not a sport acordding to IX regulations, and that if cheerleading was to be considered a sport, it needed better organization and clearly defined rules.]]>

Some places include camps for cheerleading where they train and have fun. Some camps have them stay the night once or twice, maybe even for a week or two. There are also many competive teams for cheerleading in which happen around spring or form some, all year round. For the competive teams, they must train hard and have the stregth for just about anything that comes their way. Lastly, there seems to be a lot of cheerleading televsion shows like Cheer Moms.

And yes cheerleading is about competing im pretty sure it always has been because youre competing against another school so yes it has been about competing and thats probably all it will ever be about. Another reason cheerleading is a true sport is because you have to be pretty athletic and you do have to have strength, agility and endurance. Another reason is because sports are supposed to be fun and cheerleading is and your supposed to get a workout and you do. Yes in cheerleading you toss and tumble and do complex stunts and yes you can get hurt but any other sport takes the same things for example in football you tackle instead of flip and tumble and do cartwheels like in cheerleading so no matter what sprot youre doing you can get hurt. And in any other sport you compete and try to win same thing with cheerleading so believe cheerleading is an actual true sport.]]>

Also, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics: &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies ... and school athletic bodies.&quot; So it has the same amount of training as any other sport, but why is it not considered a sport?

The Dictionary definition of an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina&quot;. In which cheerleaders fall, they have to have strength to be able to lift teammates up for a pyramid as well as agility because they have to be able to move fast and quickly they have to stamina and endurance because they have to be up and moving throughout an entire game or event. Cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, phisically, demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air. I have also done some research on the other side of the argument, the people not agreeing as cheerleading as a sport. A 2010 district court case in Connecticut, which ruled cheerleading not a sport, according to Title IX regulations, the decision was upheld in 2012 by the US Court Appeals for the Second Circuit, which stated that cheerleading needed better oranization and clearly defined rules before it could be considered a sport. In conclusion these are some of the arguments made over whether cheerleading should be a sport or not.]]>

The people who cheer go through physical pain of falling and tumbling, yet what they think is a sport that everyone thinks is a hobby. Cheerleading has the rights to be called both athlete and a sport. It requires a group of people, just like a team, to train and get fit as if a football player about to play his season. What's the difference between cheerleading and any other sport? Compare it to football: both cheerleader and football player must be fit, both get hurt as much as the other, and lastly both need to be skilled in some way. Whether if it's by running or flexibility. To people cheerleading is just a way to motivated the players of a team, in the eyes of a cheerleader they think of themselves as athletes.]]>

Cheer leading is a big play in sports, just as any other game is because you work hard and you put effort into it.

Some people think that it's just cheering and shaking pompoms, but you need strenght and practice to make it a true sport. Cheerleading needs skils such as the strenght of a football player, yet the grace of a dancer. It is not easy doing that when you have to throw someone into the air and have the strenght of a fooball player. That's the reason that the cheerleaders practice. Cheerleading needs practice such as other sports, because it's not that easy. Cheerleading also needs skills of a gymnast. A gymnast and a cheerleader need the same skills because they both have to do flips. Cheerleaders need to becareful, it is a dangerous sport like many others, and involves concentration. If a cheerleader isn't concentrating and relaxed that could result in a hurt muscel. Cheer leading needs the grace of a dancer. If they don't look graceful then they will end up looking like football players yelling at the crowd. The gracefulness has to do with the gymnast skills too. They have to land softly and not hard when doing flips. Therefore they wont look so intense and like a football player. My final conclusion indicating that cheerleading is really a sport is that cheerleading takes practice and difficult skills to learn, therefore it should be considered a sport because many sports involve difficult tasks to complete and to succesfully master them it takes efford and practice, too.]]>

According to Title IX regulations, it states, &quot;Title IX regulations-require universities to offer equal athletic opportunities to both men and women; under Title IX, a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, and a governing organization; its main goal must be to compete.&quot; Cheerleading does fit all of the requirements above. For example, at Washington High school, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the cheer program there has coaches, they practice, they compete, both men and women can do it, and they have a defined season. This shows that cheerleading is a sport. My last reason to prove that cheerleading is a sport, is how strong and talented you have to be to be a cheerleader. American Academy of Peadiatrics report on cheerleading injuries, &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive, physically demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air.&quot; This proves how much skill, talent, and time it takes to be a cheerleader. In conclusion, this shows that it takes the same or more skill to be a cheerleader than in any sport.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Firstly, cheerleading should be considered a true sport, because the people who compete in it are athletes. They are almost the very definition of &quot;athlete&quot;. They compete in events just like athletes in other sports, so that means cheerleading should be a sport. Even doctors at the American Academy of Pediatrics say that, &quot;Cheerleading should be designated a sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports governing bodies...and school athletic departments.&quot; So just for safety alone, cheerleading should be a sport. Title IX states that a sport must have coaches, practices, competitions during a season, and clearly stated rules before it becomes a sport. Cheerleading has coaches and practices. The athletes all compete during a season, and there is an International Cheer Organization that should have default rules. So under those guidelines set down by Title IX, Cheerleading is a sport. Biediger v. Quinnipiac University ruled that cheerleading needed more organization and clearer rules to comply with Title IX, but as I stated, cheerleading does meet these standards. Cheerleading started out at the University of Minnesota in 1898. Back then it was just male students from the &quot;pep club&quot; that were elected &quot;yell leaders&quot;. Now it requires the athletic ability to do leaps and flips, like a gymnast. The strength to lift your fellow cheerleader, to create the human pyramid. All these skills put together makes a world class athlete. So how could cheerleading not be a sport if world class athletes compete in it? Even President George W. Busch was a cheerleader, so cheerleading isn't just for average people.]]>

If the chearleaders want to beat their component they will have to go out of their way for practace. Coaches must make sure that everyone is there and that if someone isn't they will have back-up plans and contact to see why that girl/boy isn't there.

In his paragraph he brings up the fact that Cheerleaders have to be athletes, and have strength, agility, and endurance as the football players do and others who play sports as well. As I read through the students notes, I noticed some very good reasons and evidence to support his claim. In his first note he states the definition of the word &quot;Athlete&quot;. The definition says, &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; The things stated here are the things that Cheerleaders need to have in order to have success in Cheerleading. In his sixth note, he takes note of what a Director of a Competitive Program has to say. &quot;Cheerleading... it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must has the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player...&quot;. This shows me that Cheerleading is a sport because if you have to have the same strength as a football player to be a Cheerleader, shouldn't Cheerleading count as a sport? After reading through the students notes, I believe that his notes really do support his claim about how Cheerleading should be considered a sport.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Sports like football and basketball get to go to things like nationals and are recognized as a real sport, but cheerleading teams also patricipate in national competitions and championship events. If the Title IX regulations require that a sports team must have competitions and that the main goal must be to compete, then why wouldn't cheerleading be a sport since it also participates in regionals and nationals and competitions? A director of a competitive cheerleading program stated, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competeing.&quot; Cheerleaders compete in competitions just as much as any footbal, basketball, soccer, or any other sports team does. Sports like baseball and basket ball go way back in time, but so does cheerleading. According to the website of international cheer organization, cheerleading was invented by male students at the university of minnesota in 1898. Members of the &quot;pep club&quot; elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to engage the crod during the football team's last game of the season. Cheerleading goes back as far as 116 years, that's over a century. If sports were invented that long ago, then cheerleading must have been invented along with them. In the dictionary, the definition of an athlete is: &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Once again said by the director of a competitive cheerleading program; &quot;The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than just yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Cheerleading meets allthe requirments of an athlete, agility, strength, and stamina, so shouldn't they be classified as a sport as well as football or basketball? Cheerleaders practice just as much as they do, have as many competitions as they do, and have the same skills as any football or basketball player.]]>

In Gymnastics you have to be flexible and in (example) football you have to be very strong. I will give you a paragraphs worth of reason on why i think this boy is correct. I think that cheerleading is a sport. You have to be very strong to pick up your team mates to create a human pyramid and you must be extremely flexible to get into all sort of shapes and positions. In cheerleading you need mainly two of the same things from different sports. Wouldn't that make Cheerleading a sport?]]>

You need strength to throw someone in the air or to be at the bottom of a human pyramid. Cheerleaders need stamina to keep up the energy during the whole game. They espicially need to be flexible for all of the handsprings that they do. Cheerleaders train just as hard as footballs players, basketball players, baseball players to be in shape. Cheerleading isn't just shaking pompoms. It is a competition against schools, teams, and/or states. Believe it or not, they hold Nationals for cheerleading, just like the Super Bowl, the NBA Finals, or the MLB World Series. Nationals for cheerleading is where the best of the best go. The Super Bowl is where the 2 best teams compete and only 1 wins. Nationals is where the best cheer teams compete and only 1 team wins.

The director of a competitive cheerleadingprogram said, &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah rah rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Today, our cheerleading has complicated tumbling, positioning, and cheorography, which makes this sport more of a sport than something like golf. Becuase of the amazing skills and tecnique needed, the worldof cheerleading should be a sport. Also, the National cheerleading organization sponsors, &quot;regional and national competitions and championship event; high school cheer camps; youth camps.&quot; As a whole, cheerleading is an athletic sport that even has camps to improve your skill, and sponsors to fund for the camps. These sponsors and camps have shown that just like ever other sport they offer improvment. While people do believe that this sport isn't really a sport, others, likeme, believe, &quot;Cheerleading has evolved dramatically into a competitive,physically demending, year-round activity consisting of fast paced floor routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building and tossing athletes in the air&quot; (American Academy of Pediactrics report on cheerleading). Requiring much agility, stability, and endurance this should be considered a sport to others. Just as much effort is needed to play any sport so therefor this should be classified as a sport. Using up all the requirements needed to be a sport, cheerleading needs to placed under the sport classifications.]]>

The defenition of an athlete is &quot;a person who is trained or skilled in excercises,sports,or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; All of the cheerleaders are being trained by a coach and they have practices like any other sports. Cheerleaders have physical strength just like anyone who plays a sport. Another reason is that these cheerleaders are more than just cheering for a game. Like the Director of a competitive cheerleading program said &quot;Cheerleading isn't about cheering for the football and basketball teams anymore; it's about competing. The girls and boys who cheer must have the skills of a gymnast, the grace of a dancer, and the strength of a football player. Cheering is more than yelling 'rah, rah, rah' and shaking pompoms.&quot; Like he said that these boy and girls must have skills of gymnast.

Cheerleaders must have skills of a gymnast, perform as gracefully as a dancer, and it is also very important that they have the strength of a football player. What makes a sport a sport is that there are coahes invovled, practices and competitions during a defined season to attend, and a govering organization. Most importantly though, is that the main goal is to compete. Cheerleaders have coahes, they have to practice their routines, their are regional and national championship events where they can compete. Some argue that cheerleading is not a sport because it lacks in areas of rules and organization, but cheerleading was invented by male students at the University of Minnesota in 1898. They were apart of an organization called &quot;pep club&quot; who elected &quot;yell leaders&quot; to help get the crowd engaed at the last game of the season. An athlete is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. Cheerleaders are athletes because cheerleading is competitive,physically demanding, a year-round activity consisting of fast-paced floor rountines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling,and complex stunts, such as pryamid building and tossing athlets in the air.

In the Dictionary athlete means &quot; a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; Cheerleading meets these because the athlete who is a cheerleader has to be athletic, have strength, agility, and endurance as many high school sports. That is another reason why cheerleading should be designated as a sport.]]>

We must lift other cheerleaders, like in a pyramid, which requires strength and stamina. We also must perform tricks and gymnastic-like moves like cartwheels, backflips, and back handsprings. So, technically, cheerleaders can be defined as athletes. And what do athletes do? They play sports! Cheerleading is much more than yelling &quot;Go team!&quot; and shaking pom-poms anymore. Have you ever been to a soccer or football competition or championship game? Well, cheerleading has those, too. The NCO (National Cheerleading Organization) also sponsors high school cheer camps and youth camps to help prepare them for cheerleading. If cheerleading has the same activities as other sports, then why isn't it defined as one?]]>

It needs to have its own set of rules and regulations. As stated in &quot;American Academy of Pediatrics&quot; &quot; Cheerleading should be a designated sport so that it is subject to rules and regulations set forth by sports overning bodies... and school athletic depatments.&quot; This shows that many people don't want to see people getting injured. They would like cheerleading to become an official sport so that the rules will protect the cheerleaders. As it stands right now every single one of the cheerleaders is subject to injury due to the fact that rules are not inplac to protect them from dangerous stunts and the right equitment used. To continue, the time people put into this sport is amazing! The amonut of time put into this sport is just as much as any others. According to &quot;American Academy of Pediatrics&quot; &quot;over the last century, cheerleading has evoled dramatically inot a competitive, physical demanding, year-round activity consisting of fast-paced routines with leaps and jumps, gymnastics-style tumbling, and complex stunts, such as pyramid building or tossing athletes in the air.&quot; This proves that cheerleading isn't some rinky dink after school activity, it's a sport with many hours put into it. Many days of practice, training week after week to get into tip top shape. Having to get the timing of everything otherwise injury will happen. Finally, the definition of an &quot;athlete&quot; is, &quot;A person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina.&quot; All of these thing are found in cheerleaders. Thye must be able to hold up other girls or boys, therefore meeting the strength requirment. Must be flexible enough to bend ans stretch into shapes and spaces. Have to train in order to get the timing of everything right. To finish, cheerleaders have to have stamina to keep training day after day, competing week after week.]]>

Gymnastics and football are both classified as sports; so why isn't cheerleading? I'm not talking about the stereotypical cheerleading with a group of girls standing on the side lines shaking their pompoms and cheering on the football team. Cheerleading is an 'activity' where the cheerleaders go to competitions and preform their routin that they have been practicing for months. They have to have the skills of a gymnast, grace of a dancer and strenght of a football player. Still don't think it's a sport?]]>

The definition of cheerleading is a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina. In cheerleading all of those things are required which makes cheerleaders athelets, and you can't be an athelet without a sport. This gives more reasons why cheerleading is a sport. Also the American Academy of Pediatrics state that cheerleading is competitive and that they toss the athletes into the air. So, they also think that cheerleaders are athelets. The American Academy of Pediatrics think that cheerleading should be a designated sport so that it is subject to rules and regulatios set forth by the sports governing bodies and school athletic department.

They're trained and skilled in routines, and their routines require physical strength, agility and stamina. According to Title IX regulations, a sport must have coaches, practices, a defined season with competitions, a governing organization and a main goal to compete. Cheerleading has serious competitions, an international organization, a specific time for their season, an incredible motivation to compete, and most importantly, a coach. The main use isn't just for cheering other sports on anymore, now cheerleaders are highly competitive in state competitions, and have a stereotype of having the most popular kids in school participate in it. Cheerleading is a lot like dance, and if dance is considered a sport, why shouldn't cheerleading? Football and other major sports all have state and regional competitions, camps, and definitely casuse major injuries. Cheerleading does the same, and requires the skills of a gymnast and the grace of a dancer. It has the qualities of many sports and mixes them all into one, so it shouldn't be left in the dust. There are many eager and dedicated students in the sport, and people like it just as much. If it's treated like a sport, doesn't it deserve to be called one?]]>
