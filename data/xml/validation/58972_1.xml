Right now though 1 trillion dollars of student debt is federal , meaning that it is the US taxpayers paying the students debt off. Also one might say it will cause the stuent to buy things they dont need, instead of paying for college. The students still have to pay for housing, food, books, and other necessitites. Students don't have much money to spend on other things. Last but not least is the statistic that four year college debt has grown up by 357%.

Additionally, some students may see the extra money they gain as spending money for items they do not need. Also, around $1 trillion of the $1.2 trillion in student debt is federal loans. This means that U.S. taxpayers are the ones paying for the student's education. This is an unfair burden for U.S. taxpayers to have. Lastly, public four-year college tuition has increased by 357 percent over the last 30 years. This adds more debt and results in the students not having to pay this debt, which is an unrealistic life lesson.]]>

In theory, forgiven college debt will promote the accumulation of more college debt. If debt loans are forgiven students will spend money on frivolous items, and not tuition. However middle-class students spending money is exactly what the economy needs. Their spending money will improve the economy and increase the liklihood of student's having a job after college. Currently about 1 trillion of the current 1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans which will lead to US taxpayers paying for student debt rather than the student's themselves. This allows students to focus on school rather than debt, and then taxpayers are not just paying for student debt, but for contributing community members. In the last thirty years the cost of four-year college tuition has rapidly grown by 357 percent, this is important because it means that students add more debt to pay for college and getting debt amnesty stops students from needing to pay college loans]]>

Students might not take their college oppurtunity seriously and could instead relay on the idea that similiar loans in the future would also be forgiven. However, if America's economy is to remain stable, young adults cannot come out of college with a huge dept already with them. This does not motivate students to go to college or live up to thier full potential. As taxpayers, adults should realize that their money, about $1 trillion, is invested in student loans and that this amount is nowhere near the amount needed to release students from their depts. The wealth inequality in America is so high that most people cannot affford to pay for their children to go to college, especially since the cost of public four-year college tuition as grown by 357 percent in the last 30 years. That means that we are leaving the future of America in the hands of young adults who are already in massive dept, and now have to search for a job in a closed market.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[In allowing student college debt to be forgiven, it is argued that this may set a negative trend for these young adults. With this college debt being forgiven may come the notion that futures debts that are not related to school may also be payed off by someone other than the current student themself. While this may have more serious consequences in their futures, in the short term it may also influence students to further establish more college loan debt. I do not agree with these insinuations because the students that would be recieving this help will not be so jaded as to expect further help. They have already maintained a healthy GPA and show a dedication to their future in planning to continue their education into college. These are not the type of people that would be content to keep their education going by living off handouts, there for they would not fall into this false sense of security that the opposition assumes will accompany this debt forgiveness program. Because these students would be saving so much money by way of this program, the question of what they will be spending their savings on is posed. The opposition to this program argues that this money will be spent on what some would consider to be &quot;frivolous items&quot;, but with these students I doubt that this would be the case. In attending college they have made it clear that they would like to be productive members of society, and economic stability is a part of that. Those who would benefit from this program would not be likely to pour their savings into frivolity, but would rather be too consumed with their studies to engage in this behavior. In this day and age of baby boomers criticizing the younger generations for their dependence on hand outs, the &quot;tax payer&quot; perspective plays a large role in our nations political arena. Those who abide by this way of thinking that all tax payer money they give will automatically go towards things that they do not support, argue that the one trillion dollars that taxpayers have already put into these programs is enough and that the students and their families should be paying their own way for the aforementioned students' education. This however, is easier said than done. Many families cannot afford the massive amount of college debt to befall them should one or all of their children were to attend college. The students themselves also cannot pay off this debt alone hence the need for this program. Those in society who do not support tax payer assistance of other's college education have forgotten that the key to a successful and competitive nation today in our world is the education of our youth. While the opposition is large, this program should occur so as to help both the students prosper as well as our nation.]]>

So, when you tell a student that his or her tuition is &quot;On the government,&quot; it means that not only the government is paying for the tuition, but you, a taxpayer, is paying that student's tuition aswell. This is only the begining of amnesty for loans; it is a chain effect. Similar loans in the future will alson be forgiven; forgiven college debt promotes accumilating more college debt.]]>

There is not enough taxpayer dollars to pay for every college student's tuition fee, but there are student loans for those who need help paying the fee. Although many students will be in debt because of college, there are ways to pay that debt back. Getting a job that pays well to help pay for the fee is a great way to lower the debt. Finishing college with good grades and getting into a profession that pays really well will get your student loan debts right off your back.]]>

Potential problems of debt forgiveness include the assumption that other loans that precede this will also be forgive, for example, forgiven collede debt advocates for an even larger amount of college debt. When a student realizes that their college debt is forgiven, they will most likely assume that their debt is not their own problem and fail to pay off debts they experience later in life. A very large percentage of the students in debt is in federal student loans, which means that that students and families are not paying for their debt, rather, US taxpayers are. During the last thirty years, the cost of public four-year college tuition has shown a rapid increase by three hundered and fifty-seven percent. This means that students are only adding more debt to pay for their college tuition, which creates a contiuing trend of not paying off their college loans due to debt amnesty.]]>

In the past few decades the cost of tuition has grown by a staggering three-hundred and fifty-seven percent, forcing us to recognize that students are forced to pay more and more for the usage of College campuses as well as the men and women who will teach them in their courses. Along with that economic philosophers have argued that by forgiving these debts - it will lead to a sense of security in students and they'll simply assume that as long as they do good their debts will be slated, meaning they're able to spend their money more luxuriously than prior. This is not at all the case. Our College cost has only skyrocketed due to the sudden expunge of need into our world for College-grads. to be at work, whether it be in Computer Programming and Sciences or Biochemistry, and by relaxing our tense importance we usher onto debts we'll be able to jumpstart the economy by encouraging more participants to attend College who were once prevented to do so because of economic issues or even more personal matters that tie into their flow of money. Preferably after doing so, the tuition will rock back down after the sudden burst of students dies down, and then if necessary we may revoke the law or act in which we do this action.]]>

When looked at another perspective, the flaws of the proposal can be seen. Opponents against debt forgiveness state that forgiving debt will cause students to grow accustomed to ignoring future debts, not paying back the government. These opponents fail to perceive that this proposal is being offered to college students, students who value their education and have the knowledge to make reasonable decisions. They are adults and by attending college, have distinguished themselves from their peers. The matter of not paying back debt would seem absurd to these students with their history of intelligence and common sense. Opponents continue to argue that the students will spend their newly gained money and silly, unimportant things. Yet again, the opposing arguement does not apply to college students. When considering the proposal it is important to know the audience, who it will be effecting. They are college students who have struggled with debt, helping them appreciate the offer.The proposal has no flaws and when carried out correctly, may be and will be successful.]]>

In regards to students spending their money on frivolous items, this would not happen if a policy was enforced. If students who only had a particular GPA or higher got forgiven their debt, they would most likely be the students who cared about their education in the workplace. Their debt being gone would not necessarily change their actions. Lastly, most of the debt stems from increased college tuition. It was argued that tax payers end up paying the student debt. If colleges lessened their prices, then it would be easier to forgive debt, or instead, make it more affordable for students to pay.

Once they have experienced college debt, they will not want it back. Students should take a survey and they should be observed; therefore, the program can avoid those students who would spend money on frivolous items. Those who take education seriously deserve the debt amnesty program. They should also be observed to see whether they are trustworthy or not. US taxpayers are currently paying for student's debt rather than students and families because not all of the students and families can afford it. Without the debt, maybe then people could live and get an education without having to worry about food and housing. The college tuition has grown rapidly by 357 percent and that would mean more college debt. College has become unfair to those who can no longer afford it. Knowledge isn't based on how much money one owns. The people who truly love and want education are suffocating under a heavy blankey of college debt.]]>

Money is a dispensible item, and when the burden of paying back student debt is taken away, the reminder to spend cash carefully too vanishes. Shifting to an economic vantage point, it becomes obvious that the debt amnesty program will launch the nation's colleges into a scramble to scourge the incoming student body for the money they need. Most of the loans given out to students during their time in college come from the federal collection of the taxes. This means that the US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than the students and their families.

Knowing that they are given another shot at becoming everything they have wanted to be will be an eye opener and motivation to prosper. Those students have experienced a glance of almost being stripped away from presuiting their dreams due to not being financially stable,so when people believe that they will spend money on frivolous items they will prove them utterly wrong. Student's responsiblities will then be soulely dedicate themselves on school since they will no longer have the weight of debtsous loans on their shoulders. Some say that the US taxpayers are paying for students' loans rather than students themselves and their families, yes the US taxpayers do contribute to the educational department but not the extent where a single taxpayer is paying completly every single penny of the tuiton for a student.

They'll be overwhelmed that they don't have to pay debt that they'll care less of what they do in school and will eventually cut class knowing that they don't have to pay to be there. Students in college will take advantage with the money they dont have to give to the school and will use it on pointless stuff that aren't something they need for college anyway. On the other hand, this amnesty debt can help these college students so they don't have to stress by getting a job they do not want just to pay their debt in loans that will maybe take years to pay off. Only giving it to students that have a grade-point of over 2.5 is a good idea, not only it will be effective but it's only going to those specific students and not all at once cause that will be a great advantage. It'll help students keep their grades up and not only that but they'll have higher scores, that's great for the colleges these students are going to.]]>

They say the students will grow used to loan forgiveness and will tend to borrow more than they could pay back, or to simply spend such money on items they do not need. Even though that may be true for some, most students will realize that debt is still debt. In today's capitalistic society, more and more young adults are pressured to use as little money as possible and save what they can for the future. Such teachings prevent students from needlessly borrowing because of their awareness of such potential financial troubles. Even with tuition costs and the payment of those rising prices coming from tax payers, such things are only problems if the students begin to borrow too much anyway. Those debts that exist should be forgiven because then even more students, more prepared than the first will arrive, and the slate will be swept clean, ready for another generation of students.]]>

Allowing for students to be able to gain access to the proposel of dept forgiveness is not just going to get rid of the student dept, it is then going to accumulate college dept that is then going to be put on US taxpayers. Taxpayers today already pay 1 trillion of the current 1.2 trillion dollars of student loan, so adding more college dept to be payed off by the community ends up taking away from improving roads and community areas of your town because even more of your money is going to pay off college dept of students. Although this proposition allows for more students to graduate dept free, it creates a mindset in these students that they can spend their tution money on more entertaining items then school because they will not have to pay most or all of their college dept anyway. More college dept is just going to lead to an increase in college tution which is what we are trying to prevent in the first place.]]>

Oponents also say that if students are not burdened by debt, then they will spend money recklessly instead of paying for tuition. The fact that most student loans are from the federal government means that if the debt amnesty program exists, the U.S. taxpayers will effectively have been stolen from. They insist that if such a forgiveness program exists, students will take more courses or spend more years at college running up their tuition thinking that it will just be forgiven.]]>

This gives them the idea that they can get away with something that is a big deal for no cost. This does not only affect the students life in a negative way but it also rasises taxes for everyone else. When a young adult that has gone through many expensive years of college and gets off the hook from all their debt, the money may go to frivolous items that can harm them or cause them to do stupid things. It is all about responsibility when it comes to your college debt, so when you get off the hook from paying on average $20,000 its irresponsible on your part and the governments. Hopefuly they only flower the cost of college instead of completely getting rid of the debt that past students owe.]]>

What we can do is give them some type of credit card that will only let them spend money when it has to do with their tuition nothing else. Tax payers are always asking where does all the money i pay goes. Well they can now have a reason to pay because they will know that its going to students and to help them succeed.]]>

The fact that college is so expensive is increasing the rate of loans. Many people use loans to help pay for college because they can not afford it at the time but the bad part about getting a loan is having to pay it off after graduating. Also a loan is not free money you have to pay intrest which makes it even more expensive leaving students in debt for many years. Loans are helpful to help get someone money for what they need but it can get very expensive and take awhile to pay off depending on how much money was loaned to that person.]]>

They might have been released from the school's debt, however, credit card companies will not forgive them for the large amount of debt that the students must pay. Also, if the loan debt is forgiven, students will be just spending that money on frivolous items such as videogames and other unnecessary items. If students do not pay their debt, the money will be taken from the average American through tax payments. In the one trillion dollars in student debt is in the federal student loans. This will require American taxpayers to pay an additional amount of money to pay off this debt. Over the last 30 years, a public four-year college tution has increased by 357 percent, meaning that the students must add more to their debt in order to pay for the tuition. When a student gets debt amnesty it will allow the students to get a free card from paying the college loans. Forgiving debt will not solve the problem, but instead it will create future problems for the students and other Americans.]]>

If students are not paying their debts and their loans themselves the taxpayers of the country will take on that burden, using valuable money that could be put to use elsewhere. This could potentially hurt the economy in its already weakened state and hurt the job market further for the new college graduates. Another ill effect is that the debt forgiveness program promotes accumulating even more debt for college, as it will just be forgiven. Forgiving the debt one accumulates in college will prompt the student to accumulate more because it will just be forgiven, therefore causing even more debt for the U.S. taxpayers to have to pay off for students.]]>

Rather than students and families paying for students' debt, it will be payed for by the tax payers of the US. Taxes will go up and the fact that in the last 30 years, the cost of public four-year college tuition has increased by 375% does not halp the matter. Why should tax payers provide for someone else's education? College provides an insight of the real world; if students dont understand the fact that they will one day have to do such things as taxes, then it is minimizing their education of responsibility.

The cost of tuition in most universities have more than quadrupled over the last 30 years.

Firstly, if the nation eliminates these debts now, it insinuates to future college applicants that the same policy will be in place in later years, setting an unfair precedent that may be impossible to maintain. Furthermore, if students are provided with the money that they would have spent on tuition, and are told that they may use it in any way that suits them, the money will likely be spent carelessly on materialistic and unimportant items, degrading the youth's perception of the value and importance of money. Also, roughly $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion dollars in student debt is being paid for on a federal level, with American taxpayer's dollars. Such a hefty financial burden should not be placed on US society as a whole, but rather the people to whom it belongs. Providing today's youth with the mentality that their debts can be wiped clean will not instill in them the drive or desire to work hard; it will encourage laziness and prevent many young people from appreciating the education they are being provided with, regardless of their financial situation.]]>

Students that have forgiven debt decide to make poor choices with their money instead of buying items to further their education. Unfortunately for U.S. citizens the debts these students rack up is being paid off by the tax payers of America. College tuition has rapidly increased over the last thirty years going up in money a wooping 357 percent.

That percent has not helped students lower their debt but in other words it has increased their debts.Not many students have the money to pay of their debts.Many which money grew on trees,but unfortunaly it does not.Most US taxpayers are paying for students' debt instead of students and families.So about $1 trillion of the students in debt are in federal student loans.This is a potential problem.The debt forgiveness sets precedent taht similar loans in the future will be also forgiven,but who knows.In some opinions,if loan debts are forgiven there's a slight chance that students will end up spending money on frivolous items and not on tuituion.It can be true but that's only if there isn't restrictions on the debt forgiveness.Money is easy to spend,but one has to learn ho to save it for more important neds like for college.If decreasing your debt isb't taken care of right,there can be a chance that forgiven college debt may promote accumilating more college debt.So one needs to be careful and think about loans,if they'll be worth it or easy to pay off in the end.]]>

In the last 25 years, a lot of districts have seen their state governers turn their back on the education system in and of itself, causing the schools to have less money, and thus increasing the various costs that go with education. It is a simple fact that schools do not have enough money, so instead of pleading them for released debt costs and lower averages, we need to talk to the state governments and even fedreal governmetns that are plauging the pride of the American people, education. It is a shame that most college students go to learn and end up having to worry about how much their paycheck is going to be.]]>

Although the fear of these critics is justified, they must acknowledge the fact that higher education is a neccessity for young Americans as they begin their adults life. Today, most employers require at least a college degree and expect their employees to have an adequate amount of experience or knowledge in the required subject. In order to meet these requirements, young Americans require the neccessary college education which will allow them to be elegible for these jobs.

This concept may increase the idea of students to spend more and create a bigger debt, solely because they know they would not have to pay it. This rising debt among college students is added to by the students' desire to buy items that are not as important as tuition etc. There is about $1 trillion out of the current $1.2 trillion students who are in federeal debt and also student debt. This means that US taxpayers are paying for the students instead of their families or the students themselves. The cost of a public four-year college's tuition has increased rapidly over the last 30 years by 357%. As long as these students are able to add more debt to pay for colleges, the debt will continue to grow. This does not seem like a problem to college students because they figure that they do not have to pay for it anyway. Debt amnesty has several downfalls, but overall, it is setting up a fresh and new start to the students leaving college that deserve to live comfortably.]]>

Congress or other federal official believe students will spend given money on frivolous items such as parties or clothing. They also believe that amensty will raise taxes for citizens; leaving families the responsibility to pay for taxes rather than their student. There is also a growing trend of the cost of tuition in the U.S. therefore the money that students don't pay, the colleges would have to do so. All these facts are true yet the govenment underestimates the power of education. Citizens with a college education often make double the amount a citizen with a high school degree. If everyone is making more money, there can be a tax raise and it wouldn't make a difference.]]>

This allows students that are struggling to pay off debt to be reduced in debt or wiped clean of debt. While appearing to be a helpful solution, the debt forgivness does not help the students learn to be efficient with their money because often times they buy luxuries that they could not afford before and do not need. Debt forgiveness is benificial to the debtors, but it is harmful for the taxpayers who supply the money to forgive the debtors. The majority of student loans are from the government showing that the taxpayers are paying off someone elses debts. With the debts being paid by someone else, colleges can collect more money for tuition. Tuition can be paid by taxpayers that have money to spend allowing colleges to take more than what could be payable causing the taxpayers more trouble. Debt forgiveness, though helpful to some, It is detrimental to many more.]]>

For example, about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans, meaning, US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than students &amp; families. Even though taxpayers are paying for the debts, the students are still in debt during and after colleges resulting in not being able to buy a house or finance for a car. Another argument is that if loan debts are forgiven, then students will spend money on frivolous item, not on tuition. There are programs, such a WIC, which only allow the student to buy certain items with the money given to them by the government, such as groceries. Having debt forgiveness will not result in negative effects, but it allow the student to go through college with one less thing to stress about.]]>

You will not go out and spend your money on pointless things because of the self control and knowledge that you need to pay the tuition. so this argument is inconclusive because if you are a college student you will not think about wasting your money on unneeded things when you know you have a tuition to pay.]]>

However, there are many reasons why others believe otherwise. Creating a student debt amnesty program might set the precedent that similar loans in the future will also be forgiven and it may promote accumulating more college debt. Also, if loan debts are forgiven, students will think they will now be able to spend money on unnecessary things and not save up for their tuition.]]>

If the loan debt is forgiven, students will be spending more money on things they do not really need instead of using the money for college. U.S. taxpayers would have to pay for their debt and not for families and students like they should, this could cause a big problem because the families would ask the government for support like food and money for their child's education. Student add more debt to get the money they need for college and that can cause a big problem because of all the money they are loaning.

First and foremost, forgiving student loans would create a crsis in the future generation as they would ask for fair economic opportunity as the preceding generation. This means for the colleges that they are no longer able to sustain themselves due to lack of financial revenue and therefore they can't provide education. Second, the amount of money saved by the loan forgiveness may be spent on frivolous items that are not rather educational. As young adults who haven't experienced much in the social world, the college graduates may spend their money on unneccessary objects. This doesn't help them in any way but rather harm them. Lastly, in order to make up for the loans that the students owe, the US taxpayers pay for the debt rather than the students. All in all, loan forgiveness for the college students should be prohibited.]]>

A potention problem is that this method of dealing with student debt sets a false sence of security making it out as if that if the current debt is forgiven/ignored, then it will only result in more future debts. There is also a good chance that if the students don't have to worry about their loans they will end up spending their money on unneccesary personal expenses and not their tuition.This would also result in having US taxpayers paying about a trilliion of the current $1.2 trillion in form of the current student debts. The tuition cost for a four-year collage has grown by 357 percent and counting. This only means that students add more debt to pay, and would result with them not paying for most or even none of it.]]>

If there were to be debt forgiveness this would only bring about more college debt for those who are qualified for having their debts forgiven. Now that people won't have to pay off their loans, they will spend money on unnecessary items instead of using it to pay off their tuition. Since it is estimated the $1 trillion of the $1.2 trillion in student debts comes from federal loans, instead of students paying for their debts it's the US taxpayers. Over the last 30 years the cost of tuition for a public four-year college has risen rapidly by 357 percent, which shows how students add more debt to pay for their college education.

Also, if we pay the debts they will increase the tuition which would cause more people to be in debt.]]>

This will then lead to more money being own and possible the college and other buisnesses and banks to be in debt since no one is paying them back. If college loan debts are pardoned then students will spend their money on useless and unneeded items instead of on their education and school. Another effect would be that instead of the students and their families paying for their loan debts the taxpayers will be. Instead of just paying $2 billion taxpayers would be burdened with the full $1.2 trillion school loan debt. Also with the price of college tuition increasing by about 357 percent in the last 30 years if students are given amnesty then they are adding to the debt and not doing anything to help lessen it. Therefore, giving college loan debts pardons will only cause a chain reaction of bad things to come.]]>

This will ultimately result in a lazy workforce that has all of its dues and actions paid for by the government which also does not induce a great future for America as a whole as well. Though this claim is true and it is important to make sure that people are still triggered to pay attention to their debts and take responsiblity even if one of their major debts has been paid off, it is also pertinent to understand that stopping the distribution of debt forgiveness as a whole is not by any means an option to solve the problem. The government needs to allow for a reasonable amount of debt relief per person and should take into account the person's life and current situation as well when looking at the amount of debt they have. Loans should only be forgiven for those students who show impressive results in their school work and those students who prove themselves as wanting to pursue a career in the future that they wish to invest their money and hard work into.]]>

One specific consequence of this amnesty is how it will set a precedent for similar loans in the future. The student may believe that future loans will be forgiven, and, therefore, will accumulate additional college debt. This means that students following this precedent will believe that they accumulate large debts and take more expensive items without fear. A second unintended result of this amnesty is that some students may choose to spend their money on unnecessary items instead of on tuition. They will be extending their loans for something not related to their education even though the purpose of granting amnesty is to allow the students additional educational opportunities. Statistics show that in the last 30 years, the cost of a four-year college tuition has grown rapidly by about 357 percent. By these results, the introduction of the student amnesty program will set a new trend. That is, students will get debt amnesty and will not have to pay for college loans. By introducing the new program, the college will need to beware of the various consequences that may occur.]]>

If a student knew ho or she would be exempt from college debts, they would feel no remorce in accumulating more debt. In addition, with all this free money, students may direct their cash flow from school books onto more frivilous items, such as dorm TV's and other non essential items. The debt that is created also does not disappear into thin air. The colleges still need to get paid , adn the debts must be repayed. This leaves the burden onto US taxpayers to pick up the slack, which shifts the debt from the student to regular citizens. Finally, the debt repayment process has set a continous trend of colleges increasing their tution by 357 percent over the last 30 years , which will only continue if the college debt crisis is not solved. Shifting the payment to taxpayers does not solve the issue, but merely shifts the means of payments to someone else.]]>

By &quot;forgiving&quot; students, and erasing their debt, they will not be ready to enter the real world where nobody has their backs. They will lack the responsibility that comes with paying back their debt and be surrounded by a 'safety bubble' in their heads that will make them believe nothing can hurt them. Students need to take responsibility for their debt, own it, work hard, and eventually pay it back. Most student debt is in federal student loans, this means that when the students do not pay, the US taxpayers do. It is not the responsibility of taxpayers to pay for the educations of those who are forgiven of their loans. This is half of a solution and that is unacceptable, higher education should either be totally free for all students or all students should have to pay.]]>

If students could get a job in highschool and combine their savings with their parent's savings then they would be able to afford to go to college.

For example, a potential problem is that similar loans in the future might be forgiven, like even more college debt. And, if loan debts are forgiven, some students will spend money on frivolous items, not on tuition. A new iPhone 5s or Christian Louboutin stilettos might seem more exciting than getting out of debt for many college students. Over $1 trillion of the $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans. But what does this mean? This means that US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than students and families. I bet Republicans aren't a big fan of this. And finally, over the last 30 years, the average tuition has gone up by 357 percent. That means that students are adding more and more debt to pay for college, which sets a continuous trend.]]>

In theory, the concept isn't flawed, being that we are the land of opportunity, however, the notion of responsibility seems meaningless nowadays because no matter how much effort is put into raising and making money for an education, the end result is similar.]]>

There are many reasonsd for this; however, one of the most obvious is that it sets a precedent that loans need not be repaid. It tells young people around the country that the government (taxpayers) will pay for debts they accumulate. This is not the kind of idea that we want for young people, as this is simply not the point of college debt forgivness. Additionally, if loan debts were to be forgiven, many students would use this extra capital on frivolous goods, such as electronics, instead of reinvesting it in future tuition payments. Finally, becuase about $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in the form of federal student loans, this massive debt is actually being paid by taxpayers, not individual students and their parents.

This means that taxpayers are the ones that have to pay for tuition while the student doesn't have to pay for thier own fee. In the past 30 years the debt trend has gone up 357 percent. If this continues, the economy will be hurt more and the entire country will be paying for students to go to college.]]>

The forgiving of debts sets a precedent that similar loans in the future will also be forgiven, so there is no need to worry about accumulating a massive debt. This will lead to obtaining even more college debt, or to spending on frivolous items, because students no longer have to stress about money or need to save it to pay off their debt. Besides, most of college tuituon is paid for by the state, not the students and their parents. Of the current $1.2 trillion is student debt, $1 trillion is paid for through federal student loans. Taxpayers are putting students through colleges, not students. Even if the debt was forgiven, this would not lead to a trend in decreasing tuition, but the opposite. In the last 30 years, the cost of tuition has grown by 357%. If students don't have to pay for college, they will continue to go to college and this trend will be continued. Forgiving students' debt is not the best method for dealing with large student loans.]]>

One such problem is that forgiving student loans will cause college students to rely on this loan forgiveness in order to get through college, and therefore, students do not think the debt matters and will accumulate even more college debt than they otherwise would. Another issue is that, if student loans are forgiven, college students would likely spend the money that would otherwise be used for the loans on frivolous and unnecesary items.

However, it is extremley unfair that over the last 30 years, the cost of public four year college tuition alone has grown by a rapid 375 percent, meaning students are forced to add debt to pay for their colleges and for themselves to gain a proper education.

About 1 trillion dollars of the current 1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans, a sum that would be essentially taken out of the government's treasury if the loans were forgiven and would ultimatly be paid back through tax increases. Furthermore, by forgiving student loans, the students themselves would quickjly become prone to spending money on frivilous items such as cosmetics or ikea furniture, encouraging more money lending, which could quickly add to the student's already excessive credit card debt. Worse still, the gvernment would lose money for programs such as the SBAC test and be forced to cut education funding again, as they always do, and heaven forbid we didnt have to take these tests..... sigh SARCASM eh?]]>

Furthermore, if students know that their loan debts will be forgiven, they will spend their money on frivolous items of entertainment rather than for education, which would oppose the original intentions of the amnesty. This issue does not only involve the students themselves, but also the US taxpayers who are paying $1 trillion for the students' debts when they could really be supporting students and their families instead.

When students know that they are able to accumulate more debt without consequence because of debt forgiveness, they could end up accumulating more debt than if they knew they would have to pay it off themselves. Students could also potentially use the extra money they would have with debt forgiveness on items not related to their education and items that they do not need. Students also are not completely responsible for all accumulated debt anyways. Taxpayers pay for a large portion of student debt, about $1 trillion of the current student debt is in federal student loans that taxpayers are responsible for paying for. With the huge increases in college tuition and costs of education, the student debt that taxpayers and students pay for will continue to rapidly grow. Solving this student debt issue will be difficult for Americans.]]>

A less-strict view on debts could also persuade students on purchasing unneeded items rather than schooling materials.

However, over the last thirty years, the cost of public four-year college tuition has grown by 357%. This increase causes students to add more debt to pay for college, which eventually sets a continuing trend.

Younger people have a tendancy to be much more reckless and impulsive. Some people fear that forgiving debt will increase those tendancies and encourage students to take out copious amounts of money and lie to banks about the purpose for which they intend to use it. This problem could be minimised. Another concern is that most of the nationwide student debt is in federal student loans, so the students and partents aren't really paying for it. Federal taxpayers are. The government is trillions of dollars in debt in general, not just with student loans. The general debt is what taxpayers are paying for. A lot of problems could be minimised if the government was more cautious about who they lend their money to and how much they lend out. The rediculously high tuition rates are continuing to increase rapidly, so it is almost a necessity for students to go into debt in order to pay for college. Debt forgiveness permits students to return to college and accumulate more debt. It sets an endless cycle. It also sets an example for more types of debt forgiveness to follow, and can thus have a dangerous effect on the economy. More effective solutions would be to either have schools drop their tuition prices by a certain date, or making scholarships more readily available for those who work to attain them]]>

However, this idea is not taking into account for the fact that many colleges already receive enourmous levels of tuition fees from their students, meaning that the potential increase in debt not paid over by the students during their schooling would be small enough that certain unnecessary school features could be cut or minimalized to ensure no money loss on the schools themselves. It would also potentially drive the schools to be much more selective in their admission process, meaning that students who find themselves driven to pay for their own schooling rather than take students loans would be accepted over other, less economically wise students, which would only benefit the colleges themselves.]]>

This would be a snowball effect. More loans being forgiven equates to more possibility for debt to accumulate in the first place. Additionally, this lack of debt teaches students no responsibility, meaning that students might go on to spend money on frivolous items, rather than their college tuition. This belief is incorrect in that it overlooks that fact that $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal student loans. US taxpayers pay for the debt of all students, rather than the families of those individuals. This is a huge axe over the head of the American taxpayer, which would easily be removed should debt amnesty be offered for student loans. Additionally, with college tuition costs having grown 357 percent in the last 30 years, debt amnesty would reduce the likelihood for future students to take out exorbent loans, and to prevent people from paying taxes for loans that aren't even their own. Given these huge economic benefits outweigh small risks, which are personal to those recieving loan amnesty.]]>

So either students are forced to take out many loans (which leaves them in debt) or they must be really smart to receive lots of scholarships. The American Dream is unrealistic, and is fake. Acheiving it is almost impossible, unless you are born into money. For poor people like me, who also have dreams, we'll spend forever working our asses off to try and get somewhere in life, but without money that's very unlikely. To be able to go back to school without debt would be incredible. It would give low income people or people with uncaring parents a chance to thrive in life and get farther.]]>

Forgiving one loan (college loans) can set the precedent that similar loans in the furute will also be forgiven, which can cause obvious issues not only for the people taking out the loans but the national economy as well. If loan debts are forgiven, some students may turn to spend their money on things other than tuition, which can lead to even more debt. Forgiving student debt does not go without consequence. About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt is in federal/student loans, which means US taxpayers, people that have nothing to do with the debt, are paying for it.

If the debt forgiveness is set up now, it is setting a precedent for the future. The concept of 'slippery slope' can be applied to this situation, and the results will not be pretty. Students may spend their money that they have by having their debt loans forigiven on items irrelevant to their education or job future. College students are much more willing to spend money on alcohol and food than putting it in a savings account. About one trillion dollars of the current one point two trillion dollars in student debt is in federal student loans; this means US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than those students and families. Within the last thirty years, the cost of a public four-year college tuition has grown by 357 percent, which means that students add more debt to pay for college. It only sets up a continuing trend: get debt amnesty and that student will not have to worry about college loans. College cannont be free, and there needs to be a different strategy around the outrageously high price tag that comes with a college education.]]>

Most likely, the student will spend that money on something uneeded when they could be spending that money on tuition. When these kids don't pay there tuition, it comes out of the working American's pockets in order to pay for their schooling. A high percentage of student debt is already paid for by taxes anyway.

One potential problem with debt forgiveness is it leads the student's to believe that other debt they may encounter in the future will also be forgiven; which in most cases, will not happen. Also, forgive college debt just promotes an accumulation of more college debt. So the student's will end up back where they started. Another concern is if the load debts are fogiven, then some student's will think their financial promblem can be solved that easily and may spend their money on frivolous items, rather than tuition. This will not teach students the value of money and dealing with your problems. Instead, the student's think that they will never have to deal with financial problems, someone will just take care of it for them and they can just the &quot;reset&quot; botton in life. This will not only affect individual family's problems, but also the United State's economy as a whole. About $1 trillion of the current $1.2 trillion of the United State's debt is in federal student loans.This means US taxpayers are paying for students' debt rather than students and families. The cost college has also increased immensely. In the past 30 years, teh cost of public four-years college tuition has increased by 357%. I don't know about you but that is insane.

The major effects of this amnesty of loans would be; colleges would be in debt, students won't focus their money on tuition and US taxpayers will have to pay for students' debt. All of these effects will have a detrimental effect on the future of colleges and it's students. The students will not have to focus on their debt which allows them to not have as much stress, but, they can also begin spending that money on 'frivolous items'. Forcing to have the US taxpayers pay for student loans that aren't even theirs will cause a major problem. Reforms will be asked, so that the US taxpayers can keep their hard earned money. Also with colleges offering amnesty it puts a strain on the college, which can drive them into debt. All of this effects are going to impact college and taxes in a negative way and amnesty should not be given to college students.]]>

Another major cause for debt is caused from the continual increasing tuition. Within the last 30 years tuition has gone up more than 357 percent. The high tuition causes more students to go into debt.

Debt forgiveness will throw away the $1 trillion that was paid for through taxes. Thus, people who were taxed had their money wasted to pay for nothing. It will also increase more college debt, because by forgiving somebody who can't pay for it will cause some other college student to pay for the forgiven student, increasing more debt from one student to the next. If the loan debts are forgiven students will now have more money that will be spent on frivolous things, that money could be spent back on their debt. In the last 30 years the cost for a four year college has risen by 357 percent. The only way to fix this is to pay back the debt and then reduce the cost of the tuition.]]>

Potential problems (Debt Forgiveness) sets precedent that similar loans in the future will also be forgiven. If college debt becomes forgiven, then that will only allow for more college debt to be forgiven and that is not helping the economy. Let's face it. If a student does not have to pay the debt, he/she is not going to spend that money on the tuition, but instead on items that are not important. The students shold be the ones who pay for the debt, not the taxpayers. Taxpayers already pay for the city and public schooling. It is the own students fault if they have debt, not the taxpayers.

For instance, if current students are forgiven their debt, they will expect to be given similar loans later on, which just means more debt accumulated. Secondly, the money that is not being spent on paying off loans will be spent of unnecessary items rather than tuition. Also, since 5/6ths of student debt is federal loans, this means that regular US taxpayers are paying for a student's debt rather than the student and their family. Lastly, the cost of a 4-year public college education has grown by 357% in the last 30 years, meaning that more and more debt will be stacked on as students enroll in college which creates a continuing trend of increasing debt.]]>

They help get the student set and ready for the real world. You have to work to get money. You can not just sit around and expect it to be handed to you. Some students do not get the chance to get a student loan so they try their best to pay it themselves. Students who do well in college should get some help with paying the tution.

Although we may easily forgive the debt now, we can accumulate even more debt over time with forgiving past and future college tuition debt. If loans, and debts are forgiven we also take a chance that some students will not spend money on their tuition and rather make purchases on frivolous products. Currently, the United States has about $1 trillion out of the current $1.2 trillion in student debt in federal student loans, which means US tacpayers are paying for the tuition debt rather than the families and students paying. Although these may not seem like a major reason why we should not provide an amnesty program, over the last thirty years, the cost of a public four-year college has increased rapidly by three hundred and fifty-seven percent. This overall means that students add more debt to pay for college, and with that comes a continuous trend, to get debt amnesty and not have to pay for college loans.]]>
