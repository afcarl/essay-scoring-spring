I know this because in Source #2, it states that the Aztecs did not have any advanced transportation to transport blocks of stone or wood that were way to heavy to carry on their backs like smaller blocks, or else it would've crushed them. The Aztecs also did not have cart with wheels like a wheelbarrow, so they couldn't push the stones. Instead, this source thinks that the Aztecs must have found ways to use sleds, levers, ropes, or rollers made from tree trunks to haul the immense blocks. Whatever way they transported the heavy blocks needed imagination, so the Aztecs were really creative, which was a factor that determined that Tenochtitlan was a highly developed city. The second example in Source #1 states that even though only having simple tools to construct buildings, the Aztecs built magnificent temples with beautiful carvings to honor and worship the gods they believed in. They also honored the nobles and priests by building bigger and nicer houses than the ones ordinary people lived in, which were in the outskirts Tenochtitlan, far from the beautiful courtyard and temples. Despite only having simple tools to build their city, the Aztecs found a way to build extraordinary temples without using cranes and advanced tools like what we have today. Because of the evidence I found in the two sources I used to back up my statement, I still think that Tenochtitlan was a highly developed city and it was very advanced for the time period it existed in and found ways to solve many problems they faced.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Tenochtitlan was a highly developed city, or a civilization. A civilization is a group or society of people who have developed a form of culture, government, technology, and industry. All three sources give information that would help conclude that the Tenochtitlan is a well-developed civilization. For example, in source #2, the Aztec capital had a population of more than 250,000, and had public baths, markets, temples, villages, law courts, and palaces. Public baths and temples are examples of Aztec culture, markets can be examples of industries, and law courts were part of the Aztec government. A second example can be found in source #3, whrere, rather than roads, the city contained a large network of canals, used for trade and transport, and farms used to grow a variety of vegetables, grain, and flowers. This also supports this idea because canals and boats are an example of Aztec technology and farming is also an example of agriculture. Being one of the largest cities in the world, for its time, it is no doubt that Tenochtitlan was a highly developed city by 1519's standards.]]>

In the source, it says that the Aztec began to advance without an alphabet. The Aztecs also didn't have iron tools or carts to grow and expand their city while building. This helps support the idea because without an alphabet, the Aztecs probably had a hard time communicating with each other. Also, without any iron tools or carts to haul the building materials must have been difficult and would need a ton of labor. That means that the Aztec built a titanic city that could fit 80,000 people to 300,000 people without any iron tools or carts and no alphabet.]]>

Also, another reason is that in the text it says &quot;Although they had no iron tools or carts with wheels, and no alphabet, the Aztecs managed to build a highly developed civilization in just 200 years.

The evidence to support this theory is, First,The city had many water ways so many boats with tradeable goods could get to thier destitnation faster. The boats went all around the city so thier people could trade. Next, The aztecs grew food in gardens, witch were outside the city. The gardens were organized by rows, to make picking the crops easier. Lastly, The aztecs had a clean water system, so its people could get clean water. At that time other citys like Tenochtitlan, did not have clean water. In source two, thier were many mordern day similarities. First , thier were palaces for the leader or royal officials. It showed how importent the person was depending on the type of palace. Next, thier were law courts, to house the prisenors who broke thier laws. This is like mondern days, because if someone breakes the law they would go to jail. Lastly, thier wre markets, used for tradingand selling goods. For example , if someone gave you an egg , than you would give them cloth. Of course , thier were many goods that could be traded , but some were to valuble to trade.]]>

First, in &quot;The City of Tenochtitlan&quot; by Robert Hull, it stated in the second paragraph that this tiny island had a population from 80,000 to 300,000 people. This goes to show that this city was developed becasue 300,000 people in 7 square miles is A LOT of people. Also,from this same passage, it stated that there were 4 markets in that tiny island. 2 of which were in the two main cities. That pretty much says that that island is very developed because that is like having a market every 20-30 city blocks nowadays. Those are two examples on how I think this aztec civilization is developed.]]>

Also the pyramids,temples, and the way they transported building materials really shows and tells how much they really knew what they were doing and did it well. As well as source #3 also showed how the city of Tenochtitla'n was highly developed. Source #3 shows that the Aztecs had markets and had the same city life as we do today, and they built their palaces and temples so well that they lasted for a very, very long time. Their gardens were also always very greatly taken care of. These two sources are the best sources that show the city of Tenochtitla'n was a highly developed city.]]>
