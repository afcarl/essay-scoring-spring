If you place the food and crafts booths first you might take away the places where the large games should be placed and you have no more room for the large games. If you cover up sections B,C,F, and G there will be no more room for the large games. If you cover up two of the sections I just named you couldn't but all the booths for the large games. If you do that mistake you would have to move the booths back letting the large ggames booths in or not have all of the large games.

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[<p>I believe its better to put in the large games first because since their bigger we can fine it a better spot like in a coner to have walkways because if the four other booths go in first they might end up so close to each other with out a walkway or a little bit of a walkway and thats a big mistake because if a fire happens their be no way out . The four other booths can be placed in section B because the area of the crafts is 49 1/2ft2 and the area of the food is 63 1/2ft2 and if you add it&nbsp; them you get the total of 133 and if you sudtract 133ft2 from section B which is 238ft2 its a total of 105ft2 and 105ft2 well be your left over for a nother booth .</p>]]>

Besides, if you place the booths in an area with a large amount of space, you could possibly run out of space for the larger booths. Those booths could be placed in a space that would've been more suitable for a large booth. Sections like that would be sections would be sections B, C, F, and G.

In other words, if you put the large booths first, there would be more organized sections of the fair because the smaller booths can fit in spaces inbetween the large ones. This will result in a more organized fair. The first section you should place a large booth in should be in section B because there is enough space for a large game to fit in. The second available spot for a large game would be section C because the game is 17ft by 14ft, just like the section. For the third game you could put it in two different sections. The first section you could fit it in would be section F because there is enough space to fit the booth. Another section would be section G because it has the same amount of space.</p>]]>

I thaink it would be better to set up the large games first, and this is why. (1) you could bump the food and craft boothes and knock things over then you have to clean up a big mess. (2) if you bump into the tables you could get glue on you or food on you then you have to waste time cleaning yourself up. (3) if you or anyone else makes a mess and it takes along time to clean up then you might have to keep the carnival closed longer. (4) if you have to keep the carnival closed longer people start to get mad and leave then you get less money. Besides the only places you could place the large game booths is section b, section c, section f, and section g.</p>]]>

It would because the people who are at the fair wouldnt want to see food and crafts together(i mean when you have to make more booths. You cant make the same booths to close to each other.

However, these booths only take up 238 square feet. The one large games booth, takes up that amount. Together, all three large games booth takes up 714 square feet. A mistake of putting the food and crafts is that if you put the small first, you might waste space that larger booths can use.

This would prevent accidents. We can fit larger game booths in four sections. Section B, C, F, and G. All of these sections are the same size, 14 feet by 17 feet. The large game booths would only fit in these sections because they are as well 14 feet by 17 feet. All of the other sections are to small for large game booths. An accident that could be made is if you put a different booth&nbsp; in sections B, C, F, or G. Then there wouldn't be enough room for the large game booths.</p>]]>

Maybe you could put them altogether, but you need the large space for the biggest booth. Second, you could just put the large games&nbsp; in first, because you need a lot of space for three booths that have a width of 17ft and a length of 14ft. You would do the big ones first, and then organize the booths biggest to smallest.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Because 3 of the booth is very big amount of space, you would put them in section G, because the booth would fit perfectly in, section F, because, then again, it would fit perfectly in and has the same length and height as section G, as well as the booth. The last section I would put the last booth is section B or C and if one of the spaces were filled up, you would use the other choice. The last booth would fit inside either of those sections.</p> <p>Those booths all had the same width and height as the large games booth, 14ft length., 17ft width. Besides section B, C, F, or G, none of the other large games booths would fit, or else it will interfere with the walkway.<br> &nbsp;</p>]]>

Where all of the toys the kids win. That should be section B. I think that all the other booths should be that way, you could still put it the way James placed it I just had a theory to put things that way. You can also put it the way that Kayla wants to. But we haven't heard form Kayla. My theory was that we could also have a little candy stand if there is an extra booth. It would cost at least be fifty cents. Then we can add all the money up with the money from the ticket booth too and the money of the candy booth. That's just if we have the minituer candy booth.</p>]]>
