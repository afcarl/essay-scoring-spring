This claim represents that &quot;germs&quot; are vital to our way of life and that they also play a role in protecting it. The fact that we are all biomes is present in the statement, &quot;'The typical human probably harnors some 90 trillion microbes&quot;' (Wash in Moderation). This statement proves that our life is not supported by ourselves, but by every organism that intends to harm us or benefit us for the future. Another example is when a baby is just born from the mother's womb. The child is &quot;'blanketed by an enormous, unseen cloud of microorganisms-a hundred trillion or more&quot;' (Source #3). This is another fact of how once we are born every germ in the area is absorbed buy us so our immune systam can start working.

According to the editorial piece, &quot;A Universe of Us&quot;, the number of bacteria (100 trillion) in the human body is actually greater than the number of human cells (10 trillion). Most of these bacteria are not harmful, but instead helpful to human development. Humans are all in beneficial symbiotic relationships with the microorganisms that live inside their bodies. The bacteria have a habitat and access to food, and in turn give humans regular bodily functions. According to Dr. Sanjay Gupta's magazine article, &quot;Eat Your Germs&quot;, &quot;In the digestive tract, the bacteria help regulate and restore peristalsis, the rhythmic motion of the intestine that pushes digested food through.&quot;]]>

These bacterias and viruses help make up our body and help develop a healthy immune system. (Soruce 1) We could go as far as to say that worms are helpful to our bodies and immune system. According to Jane E. Brody, worms may redirect our immune system. When Dr. Gordon says &quot;a genetic landscape&quot; he means that our body is a basically a land that welcomes different types of batercias, viruses, etc. The reason why we are able to live in the ecosystem today is because our body has adapted to all the bacteria and virsuses around us. Without early adaption, we would be sick in today's environment. From the day we are born we started becoming infested with bacteria and viruses. Michael Specter states that &quot;By the time a child crawls, he is blanketed by an enourmous cloud of microorganisms.&quot; It makes sense too. The Earth will never be a completely clean environment. Even if we were catious about these bacterias and viruses, we would still end up being infested by them. Without most of these organisms, we wouldn't be able to live today. The Earth is populated by bacteria and viruses, our bodies are just a &quot;landscape&quot; that they travel upon.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[In the above statement Dr. Godon states how we are who we are by the way we got here. Part of that is due to the help of our ancestor and the action of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; where only the best of the best are capable of surviving and passing on their traits, therefore other inheriting them (reproduction). The dinosours for example in Source #5 there is always a on-going conversation on how the dinosours actually went extinct ranging from volcanoe eruptions, to climate change, to diseases in fact. Though in order to prove something there always has to be evidence provided. Although it is not for certain how the dinosours died exactly in this source they are stating the dinosours got wiped out due to germ exposure. Supposedly, dinosourss immune system was too weak to survive certain diseases like Malaria. That is proved through the discover of fossils finding all types of bacteria and through the inspection of dung that they find certain diseases that affects us corralated with us humans now adays. As we know many diseases such as Malaria have a deadly impact on us. Though unlike the dinosours, we have the fortunate chance to reason which allows us to come up with ways to treat it in order ti be able to survive; Dinosours like many other creatures aren't able to reason, that is why they become easily susceptible to death leading to their extiniction being many of the ways why dinosours proved in this source to not be the fittest of most creatures. Another reason why as humans we are not just an &quot;expression of individual genomes&quot; is that in Source #1 they talk about dirt is good for children. That is because with the exposure of certain germs one becomes less susceptible of getting diseases and it helps in the develpment of an immune system that is in fact healthy. It is stated in fact that worms have been known to lead an immune system that had originally gone wrong resulting in things like asthma, disorders, and allergies to go back healthy again because they are able to get the ran up of our buildup of our antibodies which are able to fight theses diseases/disorders including that the bacteria is capable of becoming resistant towards certain objectives.]]>

The truth is there are more microbes living in and on our bodies than there are actual human cells. Humans, and living organisms in general, co-exist in a world where entropy rules. Chance, probability, and coincidences are what separates life from something inanimate. Humans are just molecules in the world that happened to gather up and join together, and entropy is always acting against it. The human body is just a temporary collection of molecules that were created by luck and circumstances in our universe. The thing we should be focusing on is how consciousness comes from all of this.

In Source #2, it speaks of the interest in the microbiome, and states that &quot;the basic exploratory technique is broad-scale DNA sequencing of the genetic contents of the human gut. The result is a significantly different view of who we are.&quot; This quote explains that taking a sample of the human gut allows for scientists to see what a genes a human contains, but that it is not the whole story, merely a portion of what makes up a whole human body.]]>

In another metaphorical way, one may describe the statement by stating that earth is not only influenced by green plants and trees, but it is also influenced (and impacted greater) by the individuals who live on the earth and influence the plants and trees in their positive ways. In &quot;A Universe of Us&quot; 2010 New York Times, it is explained that some results of trying to understand the little things such as the complexity of what influences us (germs, bacteria, etc.) may lead to a different view of who we are. In Michael Specter's 2012 The New Yorker &quot;Germs Are Us&quot; it is reasoned that H. pylori is three microns long and that a grain of sand is about three hundred microns. This proves that there are large quantities of tiny organisms that actually play a more significant role than most people might think. There are collective genomes of hundreds of different species all working together, as expressed in Source #2, &quot;A Universe of Us&quot; and that is why we are not just the expression of an idividual human genome. We are more than that, we inhabit potential cures to diseases on us, &quot;This has got to be an important part of the future of medicine.&quot; (Michael Specter, 2012 The New Yorker &quot;Germs are Us&quot;)]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[In Source #2, &quot;A Universe of Us,&quot; microbiologist from Washington University, Dr. Jeffrey Gordon reports that each of us has a unique DNA structure and is higly distinctive. Dr. Gordon grows an interest in microbiome, &quot;an effort to understand the diversity and complexity of trillions of organisms living within each of us.&quot; while completing his research.(Source #2) He states from his research that, &quot;We are not just the expression of an individual human genome. We are....a genetic landscape, a collective of genomes of hundreds of different species all working together.&quot;(Source #2). This statement means we all work togther to built up our immune system to germs, not just by ourselves but as a community. We make each other stronger. For example in source #4 it states that food companies like Activia have been putting more germs in their yogurt proguct compared to other companies and have been very successful because they are helping their costumers built up their immune system. If they are exposed to these types of bacteria then their immune system grow even stronger. A company like this is helping back their community as a whole. Futhermore, we are not just one individual of genome, we are one whole genome and we benefit each other by working together. Even other organisms work with people to help built up their health. For instance in source #1, it states that organisms like bacteria and worms contribute to a strong immune system. These organisms work togther to help improve our health and strenghten our immunity to other germs. People who are exposed to these organisms are training their immune system to be immune to theses organisms and thus improving our health a long the way. In addition, people who completely close these doors of bacteria may be eliminating their exposure to good germs. Thus proving above, the statement by Dr. Gordon illustrates that we are a community of organisms that are only trying to benfit each other by improving our health.]]>

It means that our way of life is directly affected to these genomes and how they are functioning. In &quot;GERMS ARE US: Bacteria makes us sick. Do they keep us alive?&quot;, Michael Specter agrees, &quot;We are inhabited by as many as ten thousand bacterial species; these cells outnumber those which we consider our own by ten to one... they play a crucial role in our lives.&quot; The quote explains how our bodies are made up of communities of bacterial colonies. Specter points out without these colonies we wouldn't be what we are today. They have an important role in how we work and ultimately our health. To add on, in &quot;Babies Know: A Little Dirt Is Good For You&quot; Dr. Ruebush alligns with Dr. Gordon when she says,&quot; The typical human probably harbors some 90 trillion microbes...so many microbes of so many different kinds is what keeps you healthy most of the time.&quot; Dr. Ruebush agrees that the many species of genomes that we are, all of them must work together to be us. She explains how the humany body is &quot;a collective of genomes&quot; and each type all serves a purpose to our bodies.]]>

It is easy to say that we are obivously not alne ont his palnet and it is logical to say that we interct with eachother every day. According to Dr. Gordon (Source 2), he claims that planet people are just, &quot;A collective of genomes of hundreds of different species working together. Dr. Gordon actually has a logical staement about people being a collection of genomes. No one on this planet can be considred a indiviual if everybody itercats with eachother. Then the more we interact with eachother, then the more germs are spread through out the landscape. Dr. Gordon is absolutley true with his statement. Dr. Gordon's statement can be realted to &quot;Babies Know: A Little Dirt Is Good For You&quot; (Source 1) becuase of the fact that all humans started out as babies. Babies are always in consatnt motion and they always try to interact with theri surroundings. Lets compare the human race to a baby. A regular human being is constantly wondering around in the world looking for a innteraction and to do this, many of them have to face germs, such as a baby. A baby will wonder around and grab anything so that they feel like they have a handle on their surroundings, just like adult human beings. Bacteria is impossible to avoid in our daily life as a human being. A human has to constantly go around, eat and explore. According to Sanjay Gupta, M.D (Source 4), he declares that even food has bacteria, but it is the edible bacteria that can be an advantage to us. People can always be in need of bacteria in their system as an advantage for growth. Dr. Gordon is logical, no one is an indiviual. We all interact and we all have a bundle of germs in our body that can not be avoided.]]>

Its really amazing though because we are all leaving the womb without single microbe but the time your child is three they are covered in microorganisms.

In her Article Brody also supports Gordons argument in stating &quot;organisums like the millions of bacteria, viruses and especially worms that enter the body....spur the development of a healthy immune system&quot; (Source 1).

In source three a scientist Blaser says that &quot;... the model tht places our genes at the root of all human development is worng. By iteslf, it simply cannot explain how rapidly the incidence of many diseases has risen&quot;. Blaser affirms the statement above as he too understands that humans are not the product of only their own genes but of many different genes. The quote above (from source 2) refers to the human body as a ecosystem where many different parts work together. Source 4 also supports this explanation as it shows how bacteria in the gut is good for humans and helps humans. Therefore, metabolic processes in the digestive tract is not the expression of only human gense but rather a variety of organisms and their genes.]]>

In source #2 Dr. Gordon explains that trillions of bacteria and microorganisms live in the human body and do both harm and good to it. In source #4 it's explained that many of the good bacteria that the human body gets comes from the food that it eats. In source #1 it's expained that from birth the human body must be exposed to billions of bacteria so that it can code itself for what's good for the human body and what's not. With that article it also explains that babies are instictivly drawn to exposing themselves to bacteria and germs. They instinctivly stick random things in their mouths not for taste but to allow their immune systems to recognize danger and recognize what's helpful.]]>

In the wild there are plants, herbavors and carnavores. Without the herbavores plant life wouldn't be able to survive because they would be killing themselves off and ultimately ending their race. Same with the herbavores, without the carnavores to kill and hunt them they would ultimately kill off their own race. The carnavores do have a wide selection but they kill each other off and reproduce quickly so they are still in balance. The proof of this isn't in these papers or sources as you call them they are in the real world where we need to turn our attention to instead of this world (school) where we stare at a screen and write essays on stuff that doesn't completely matter to anybody but the people created this test and the others who supported them. I bet in the real world you do not have to write essays for your employer. The employer expects you to do your job and to do it right, no matter what it is you are expected of it. Despite what school thinks about what the job industry requires there is such a large field of jobs that you would have to go to school for 100 years just to be a pro at them. High school and college don't teach you how to land a plane, yeah you are taught the method of it but you don't become a pro by sitting in a classroom. You get on the job training. This is true with every and any job, in college you are taught the basics and you learn from there. Elementary school is teaching you the basics as well. When you get to high school you learn things like physics and chemistry and history and alegbra two that doesn't make sense unless its in a fixed scenario. This will be all usless to us in the real world.]]>

This can be supported by the statement &quot;The very fact that you have so many microbes of so many different kinds is what keeps you healthy most of the time&quot; (Source 1). Which means that because we have so much variety it helps us to become immune to bad virus's and bacteria while also getting other benefits from them like digesting our food. Another statement that supports my interpritation of Dr. Gordon's statement is found in source four, and states that &quot;in the digestive tract, the bacteria help regulate and restore peristalsis, the rhythmic motion of the intestine that pushes food through&quot;. Showing that bacteria can help us to regulate the rate at which food gets digested; very important to our health because if our digestive track is to fast (constipation) then we won't get enough nutrients, and if its too slow then we will have we can develop problems like irratible bowl syndrome or ruptures in the stomic lining, which is why its so important to have a well timed peristalsis.]]>

Also, the prospect of any bacteria helping to make you &quot;regular&quot; shows the impact of internal reactions. In &quot;Training the Immune System&quot; (Source 1), Ruebush talks about how bacteria provokes a response from your immune system.

Within this make up, the different parts of a human need and strive off different germs and bacteria, while also being hurt by it at the same time. However, since one genome is working together with all the rest in the body, if one fails, then the rest of the body fails as well. Everything works together and must help fix all the non working genomes. They create a community, where just like a real community, they all must get along. Like they say in A Universe of Us, &quot;Scientists now have discovered another realm within our habitat-the virome, a large community of viruses. These are not the ciruses that make us sick. These are an integral part of the microbiotic universe that makes us healthy&quot;. These communities work together and do their own thing to keep the human body healthy. It's not only the human mind that controls the actions and make up of the human. We also know that some germs can be good for humans because of the places that we see them. They are everywhere, and they are known when they are there. There are many germs in yogurt, and even the health fads are eating it and still calling it healthy.]]>
