He wasn't sure what to do with it at first, but now he had an idea. He went up to his room to get it. He also brought down the boxes from the television, computer, and piano. The boxes were old, but they were not falling apart. He painted and cut and pasted and drew on the boxes until his hands hurt. When he was done, he stood back and admired his work. Just then, the doorbell rang and his cousins came in. He took them to the living room. There were the boxes.... that had been made an arcade! It worked by someone moving the joystick and one of Charles' siblings, hidden in the box, would mov a character. They played in the &quot;arcade&quot; until it was time for dinner. By then, Charles had forgotten about being hungry!]]>
