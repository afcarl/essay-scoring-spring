Everyone was on their feet at the end, and it happened to look like a sea of pink as most players and fans wore pink socks to support cancer awareness. It was a well-played game by both sides, but the Wildcats prevailed in this rivalry matchup. Todd Whitaker really provided the boost that they needed in that he rushed for a tremendous 150 yards and two touchdowns. Jose Garcia also helped the cause by throwing 30 pass completions and 1 touchdown. However, the offense wasn't all of it. Jamal Jackson, the leader of the Wildcat defense, came up clutch with two interceptions and Jason Strong managed to grab one interception. There was good play on both sides of the ball, and we haven't even gotten to special teams. Stacy King, the kicker for the Northwest Wildcats, converted all of the extra points and made one field goal which in the end was a difference maker in that they won the game because of that.]]>

Toodd Whitaker made two touchdowns just like jason and ran hundred-fifthy yards trying to help and support his team-mates by letting them do what they're most good at to win the game. Jamal Jackson and his team-mate Stacy King both weren't able to intercept enough, make touchdowns but they still did their best to make sure their rivals didn't have the ball. Stacy and Jamal might have blocked their rivals, and that could have been the reason why Todd, Jose and Jason made touchdown and ran about a hundred-fifthy yards!! It's all about teamwork!!!!!]]>

For example, in the games of Wildcats against Buckaroos, the score was 38 to 35, Wildcats taking the win. On the wildcats team, Jose Garcia scored 1 touchdown and completed 30 passes, and Todd Whitaker scored 2 touchdowns and rushed 150 yards. The football teams of the 8th grade were very supportive of canceer awareness. They would wear pink socks, with their fans, to support cancer awareness. They had many fans cheering them on at their games. In the survey, it says that there were a total of 500 fans sin the stands. The Wildcats team must have been very skillful since their coach says that they are the best team he has coached since he started at Northside Middle school. They say at Northside Middle School that the East Middle School Buckaroos are their rivals. In conclusion, the 8th grade football teams are having a good season so far.]]>
