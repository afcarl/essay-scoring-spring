They say this simply because the wind doesnt blow 24/7; so what would happen during the time the wind is not blowing. Another reason why people would oppose the use of Wind Energy is the endangerment of the wildlife. Since birds migrate they could easily get hit by one of the turbines and die. Another counterclaim mainly for the people worried about the land looking not as nice as it used to be would be that the turbines are to big, the design of the turbine is ugly, and it would ruin the rural landscape scene that used to be there.]]>

Take into consideration that windmills are very large objects and take up a lot of space and land. For example, two years ago when I went to Palm Springs for spring break, there was a certain are where tons of windmills were and you cuold watch them for about 5-10 minutes while driving. They took up a huge area of space. The downside to this is that not every region has room for windmills and it can halt development of regions as many other buildings cannot be produced. Furthermore, windmills are threatening nature as well because since they are know for taking up room, they are also threatening forests and moutains as land is being occupied with these energy sources. Windmills are a great idea for the environment, but have many downsides to them as they can hurt nature if we don't use them in a wisely manner.]]>

The productivity of windmills can vary greatly, as most windmills will not run continuously throughout any given day, as well as the fact that wind speed can vary by as much as ten percent and turbine power can vary within a margin of twenty-five percent. The need for space can also inhibit windmills' efficiency due to the fact that the large tracts of land required to develop sizeable wind farms are quite often obstructed by forests, mountains, and man-made establishments. Windmills are further questionable in their reliability as functioning machines. Turbines can undergo severe damage from storms (some have undergone reported lightning damage) and flocks of migrating birds, both of which can cost thousands of dollars in repair for the turbine. As far as endangering the environment is concerned, besides the aforementioned killing of birds, windmills are an aesthetic disruption of the peaceful serenity of many picturesque landscapes and transmit bothersome noise pollution, similar to that of a small jet flying overhead, across wind farms and their surrounding areas.]]>

It can create energy that can regenerate into what we call, windmills, that can be used for electical devices.Many are mainly built in the the western and mid-western United States in areas where there is the a lot of wind. There are many advantages and disadvantages in these windmills. The advatages and diadvantages of these windmills is that it is free, it can regenerate enough energy for a nuber of people, and that it can be a hassle in many situations. Windmills are free in places where it is at its highest peak, such as mountains, hills, and rural areas. Its mainly free there because of the lack of eletrical service and that is where wind is always occuring at a high rate. Windmills can be in a good use when a eletcrical grid is out. or when hurricanes, power outages, or brown outs. Windmills can have alot of energy in it that can be used for a massive amount of people. Windmills became really popular in the United States because of the decrease of the costing of eletrical services. Windmills can become very handy is any situations, but the disadvantages can upset many people. For example, we have to depend on wind for windmills to create energy, it can become very noisy in order for these to work , and the constuction of windmills can become hard work. Windmills can be put to geat use, but the disadvantages it has are worst.]]>

Wind does not blow 100% of the time, meaning users would also have to draw energy from a backup source or risk going without power when the wind dies down. This could be devastating for places such as hospitals and airports, whose continued functionality is vital for safety reasons. Also, wind speeds are not always consistent. They can vary by a margin of 10%, which can cause power fluctuations of up to 25%. In order to supply necessary power reliably, only 75% of the wind farm's could be counted on, whch means the possible 25% extra power would be wasted or need to be diverted or stored, another hastle. One more important factor is the necessary elements needed for a wind farm. Cities, for instance, do not have space for massive turbines, which means they would have to be constructed outside of the city. This would waste money on extra power cables to run the power into towns. If the clients of electrical companies want renewable energy, solar power would make an ideal substitute in this case, becasue solar pannels can be mounted on the tops of skyscrapers. For these reasons, wind energy is an unreliable source of power.]]>

For example, when relying on wind as a resource for energy, there mus be some wind at all times. However, this is not true. Wind does not blow all 24 hours of a day 7 days a week. This means that there must be some way to store the energy, otherwise, we can't expect energy all the time. Furthermore, obstructions, such as forests, mountains, building, and oher man-made structures prevent wind from traveling, thus preventing energy from being created. The turbine would have to be placed in an open field for there to be as much wind as possible. Additionaly, wind power is unsafe for endangered wildlife. migrating birds might get hit by the turbine, causing a domino effect. The impact of the bird hitting the turbine might cause a disruptance in the balance of it, causing it to turn unsafely, thus causing it to break and hurt the surrounding wildlife. Clearly, Wind Power has its flaws and needs to be perfected more.]]>

Many of the places that we have to put the windmills are occupied by things like buildings, and other man made structures. The removal of these structures would cause damage to the land, and also ciost a lot of money. The energy that would be used to tear these places down would be repaid by the wind energy after a long time. So in reality, the energy that would be produced for a while would only be enough to replace the amount that it took to actually put up the windmill. The gradual build up of the energy would be the uneeded amount of energy that would have been saved if the windmill was never put up. Another factor that could negatively affect the situation is the fact that small wildlife and migrating birds could be at risk if these windmills were placed on their flight path. These birds would have to risk their lioves for something that they have done for centuries with ease. The windmills could be a contributing factor to the number of deaths of many species of wildlife.]]>

The majority of the negative aspects just revolve around the fact of how do they affect society and wildlife. one negative effect with the windmills is that they are not always working to produce energy because there is not wind blowig everyday. The speed of wind is another factor that affects the production of electricity though windmills. Wind speeds vary by 10% and the power of the turbine varies by 25%, showing that the amount of wind affects the total amount of variations. Windmills also provide a negative view for the locations in which they are loacated. One thing in which windmills give a ugly view on is because the turbines are too big and having an ugly design, meaning that they make the landscape look bad. Windmills also have very noisy blades, which can cause wildlife to be endangered because animals need a certain way of life to live. Although, windmills are a clean form of electricity there are still somethings that need to be fixed.]]>

Why would he even count that as a disadvantage? Does it still generate electricity? Yes. Does it help a ton of people across the United States? Yes. All the things that turbines have done to make the earth a better place to live on you complain about the design, really? There is a place on the 10 freeway called, Palm Springs, and in Palm Springs you can see a lot of wind turbines everywhere! There they are all in rows of 23. But the way I see the turbines, it doesn't look like they had to cut down any trees or buildings etc. It was all desert. Obstructions were not needed at all they always created wind farms on unused acres. How do I know this? I did this for a project last year called, &quot;Renewable Energy&quot; (Getting off topic I know, but I don't care.) So I had to do a lot of research on electricity, solar power, hydro power, and wind power. So I know what I'm talking about. Don't believe me? Google it. lol]]>

A larger amount of people would agree that it is not more effecient or costly. Wind energy would not be beneficial because it is not always available, the cost is high regardless of decrease, and there are too many obstructions around the country that hinder its use. Wind is not available everywhere at all times. Desserts and many inland cities hardly ever recieve enough wind to power an entire city or town. If we were to rely on wind for energy, there could be bigger issues. Some cities would be more powerful than others which could lead to imbalance and people moving in and out of cities. The newest turbines have new technologies that are costly to produce and maintain. There is not always enough money to afford to maintain the mills and hire workers to install them. No matter how low the price, it would be cheaper to use other energy sources. The landscape is different all over the country. There are many obstructions that would hinder the use of wind power. In a big city, there are skyscrapers that block wind and take up space that we would need to install the mills. Forests would have to be destroyed to make room which could put wildlife in danger. There are many rocky mountains that would make the installation of mills even harder and it could ruin a beautiful landscape. Wind power is not a beneficial source of energy. It is not always available, it is costly regardless of a decrease in price, and there are too many obstructions that hinder its use. To save wildlife and the overall beauty of landscape, there should not be a growth in the use of wind power.]]>

For example, Windmills have fewer enivromental impacts then other engergy sources such as gas (which causes polltion) and nuclear (which leaves behind destructive material for ages). Many people complain that windmills are unable to blow for the entire day or that they cause too much noise. These minor problems are super easy to solve. For example, widmills only provide energy for a certain portion of the day, but humans are only awake for a certain portion of the day. For this reason, it's perfectly understandable and okay that windmills don't blow all day. As for the noise, to make matters easier, the location of windmills could be in places that do not have much people.You obviously wouldn't be placing a windmill in the middle of the city, but even by locating it in the countryside you are benefiting the environment by so much.]]>

Today in everyday life we use energy like crazy but in order for wind energy to perform well we need constant wind. Wind does not blow at every second of every hour of every day. If we do not have that constant wind blowing 24/7 then our supply of energy will surely decrease. Our world already has to deal with so much pollution from burning up coal and wasting gas. We do not need to contribute more to this pollution party with noice pollution.

One of the windmills more praised features is it's lack of ability to create pollution, as all it needs in order to generate electricity is wind. However, the windmill is only partially deserving of this praise. It produces no smoke, no ash, no toxic pollution, all this is true. The pollution created is of a less conventional sort, that of sight and sound. Wind farms have been compared to sounding like a small jet engine, and the optimal locations for these farms, at the top of hills and ridges, are also the optimal locations to destroy any natural beauty a landscape may have. Which leads into it's second downfall, it's unreliability. Wind mills create electricity by harnessing the power of the wind, wind that does not blow at a constant rate, nor in a constant direction. Therefor, windmills cannot supply a constant stream of energy. On the subject of unreliability, windmills not only have an unreliable power source, but are unreliable themselves, having a power output that varies by at least 25% when the wind only varies 15%.]]>

The problem with wind-based electricity is that it is not reliable and stable. There is no one place where the winds blow all the time from dawn to dusk, meaning that energy generated can vary from day to day. Also, the turbines can be obstructed by various factors, depending on the area. Forests, mountains, buildings, these things can get in the way and reduce the effieciency of the wind turbines. The wind turbine is not the most aesthetically appealing, either. The turbines tend to have a large design, built for maximum efficiency. The problem is that this creates an almost obnoxious contrast with the rural landscapes where these are generally found, and the turbines contain a small but noisy jet engine that creates more noise. This noise is as erious issue in rural areas, and the noise can ruin the ecosystem by scaring off birds and animals. Wind turbines might be a solution to fossil fuels and climate change, but then they become a completely different problem. The turbine become a potential safety hazard to various parts of the ecosystem. Birds don't always pay attention when they fly, so they might not see the incoming, several inch thick blade bearing down on their body. So aside from the noise pollution, now ther is a safety hazard for wildlife, especially where there are endangered bird species. Moreover, turbines aren't built to deal with lightning storms, so when they do strike, the turbine can break down, requiring a good deal of time and money to repair. Worse, they fall over, becoming the equivalent of downed power line, dangerous to both people and fauna, with the additional risk of causing a fire, especially where there tends to be fairly little rain and lots of dry grass. Wind power is a much better alternative to fossil fuels compared to, say, nuclear fusion, but there's too many risks and problems to put a wind farm on every acre of land]]>

One of them being that the wind may not always blow hard enough or may not blow at all so it is not a reliable source because you cannot forsee the weather. Another downside to having wind turbines is that they are very very noisy so if someone lives close to them they will not be able to sleep well because of the excessive noise caused by them. The wind turbines are also not a good sight to see in fact its more of an eyesore because they are so big and take up so much land. If some citys dont have much field area were will they put these wind turbines, that is another thing to consider. If there is not enough room in the citys they may have to tear down forest area and ruin animal's natural habitat. Also usually wind goes at a rate of 10% while the energy needed to power the wind turbine is 25%, not a very realiable source if you ask me. There are many things that could go wrong with this but these are just a few of them.]]>

Although, the student never added the disadvantages to having wind powered engery. Some palces that set up these windmills may have to cut down trees and take away from animals. Other places may not have a 24/7 wind streak. If there is a hurricane then the windmill could attract lightning. There are many ways the windmills could go wrong. Trees and animals are sources of life. Trees produce oxygen and animals are a source of food. Although, in some places, such as mountains or hills in a forest, trees could be cut down to make windmills and land could be taken from animals.The windmills could take up land from the anmimals or be a hazard for migrating birds. If land is taken from caddle, for example, then they have less grass to feed on. Therefore, we could be getting less meat. When trees are cut down, then we lose one more source of oxygen, Yes, the windmills make wind, but they do not make oxygen. Although places like the shores at beaches and high hills have a steady wind, the wind is never blowing all day every day. There are many times i have wittnessed none of the blades on windmills turning because of the lack of wind. As another thing to ponder on, what are the windmills made of? If we do get a hurricane, the wind will be great and continuous! Although, if lightning starts to appear, the windmills might attract it. Someone could get seriously hurt if that happened. Or if one windmill is not secure into the ground and it fails to stand and falls. It could easily fall down a hill and hurt someone if it had already fallen. There are many ways you could get hurt.]]>

It doesnt matter about the design or how &quot;pretty&quot; it looks because its the safest way to make energy and saves the earth. One more disadvantage in the students notes is that Wind speeds varies by 10%-turbine power varies by 25%.

First of all, windmills, of course power through wind. Of course this is no problem for the western side of the country (United States), it is difficult in other areas. For example California, the weather always varies, but we are not certain that there will be a good amount of wind that can produce enough energy for a whole city with a large population. Not to mention the amount of energy and electricity that big companies,factories, skyscrapers etc. use, how are we certain that the amount of wind there is around us can actually supply us? Are windmills actually a good way to be &quot;greener&quot;? There are many precautions you must take into consideration before you actually set the grounds for it. Where would the windmills go? We have all know what a windmill looks like and if you haven't just picture a large standing windmill with noisy blades going at ,what you see, a slow pace. In the event that windmills were to be placed, it would mean that eventually forests, mountains, and wildlife might be in danger of been cut down/ overpowered by these large contraptions. Isn't the whole point of windmills is to help better our living? So when you think about how great windmills might be, stop and think about the small factors hiding behind a curtain.]]>

In this case, windmills are affecting the daily lives of many people as well as the natural habitats of nature. Throughout the years, windmills are becoming very popular, due to their efficiency and &quot;environmental saftey&quot; standard. As a result, there have been many harmful outcomes due to this wind power formula. For an example, migrating birds are sliced in pieces when they are not cautious of the windmills, this affect will slow down the populations of bird speices that must migrate yearly as a routine. Also, the sound that windmills create is known to be heard within a 6 mile radius. This means that people will hear this for basically all their years of living near a windmill factory. Furthermore, therer have been many reports weather windmills are affecting people with their sleep as well as health. Many said experiencing headaches is very common due to the windmills installed in their homes. By creating more windmills, this will cause a dramatic effect on both humans and nature.]]>

Today, we use wind energy in our day to day lives. However, wind energy also has its disadvantages. Wind energy is a thing of the past, with morern day technology we can develop new and more efficient energy generation. Alot of the times many of our windmill blades do not spin. This causes for unreliability in how much energy we can gain. To solve this, engineers placed many turbines so at least some would catch a draft. But even then, having turbines takes up large amounts of space endangering wildlife. To build a windmill the area must be cleared meaning all ecosystems must be moved damaging the natural landscapes. They aren't so survivable in a lightning storm either, they take heavy damage leaving less and less reasons to keep them. Even then with modern day technology we can make dams to power turbines that are more efficient than wind energy. Wind energy isn't the best route to go with modern day technology. It would be much more efficient looking into future technology for energy generation that doesn't cause as much havoc its surroundings.]]>

Such as, windmills are generally noisy and are ugly in design so it could ruin rural landscape. Also the wind isn,t always blowing the wind can also blow really softly so it wouldnt be very effective. Also, windmills are a danger to migrating birds that could fly into a spinning blade and get killed. Also, Turbines are like beacons for lightning they are constantly being damaged by lightning strikes, and need to get repared to often. obviously there are many side effects that wind farms and harnessing wind energy could ensue thats why using wind energy is a bad idea.]]>

Unfortunately, the power and energy that comes from the wind has a tremendous amount of disadvantages. Wind energy is ungrateful, noisy, and ruins the environment. With the energy behind the wind, it seems to have a mind of its own. The wind blows when it wants to and stops when it feels done, it never blows 24/7. In order for the wind energy to work properly, we would need the wind to blow 24/7 and that isn't possible. These noisy things that have been placed in ourn fields are loud and noisy with blades on them which turn when the wind blows. The turbines that are big and ugly only create noise for those around, they aren't silent. Lastly, how dare this wind energy ruin the environment. They are obstructions in the forests, mountians, buikdings, and other man-made structures. But lets not forget about the amount of pollution that comes from these things. They are noise pollution, they environment can't sustain off of the wind energy created. Cosquently, the numerous disadvantages behinf wind energy cause people to stop and realize what is happening to our world. The use of wind of energy is disrespectful to others around, loud and messy objects, and have destroyed our environment.]]>

These are also very big and it would be difficult to fit them in some areas due to that reason. Each one of these statements shows how all together using these wind turbines is not worth the issues they bring.]]>

This stuff use to create energy with wind just messing up the places they put it to. Windmill is a huge resources to get energy but it can endangered migrating birds. It really a danger thing for birds mostly if they dont put a thing to cover it like a net so that bird won't be able to hit it while they're on migrating season. Turbines create a lightning damage that might cause someone to lose a life so there's should be a baricade or something around it.

First, wind turbines wouldn't work as well as natural gas or electricity because the wind doesnt blow all day; you would only have enough energy to last you a few hours. Another reason why wind energy wouldn't work as the primary source of energy is that you cant put wind turbines everywhere. It doesn't get windy enough in certain places, and it makes too much noise. Even though wind turbines don't create air polution, they create noise polution; they are as loud as a small jet engine.]]>

Wind mills increase the carbon foot print left by humans, eventhough they are creating a renewable source. They also are known to be extremely noisy and disrupt the peace and quiet. As more and more wind farms are constructed acros the United States, more habitats are being destroyed. Trees that once thrived in the rural area are now mostly gone, They are chopped down in order to put up a windmill. Chopping down that tree will destroy an animals home and leave it out in the cold.With the destruction of their homes, more animals are now found dead on nearby highways. They are killed for attempting to find a new home becasue their old one was destroyed. With less animals living in their natural habitat they become victims of becoming an endagered species. Along with the destruction of trees more carbon is being released into the atmosphere. The realease of carbon into the atmosphere is extremely dangerous.With more carbon in the atmosphere it is helping to destroy the ozone. The destruction of trees not only damages the lives of humans but animals as well. If ever found driving near/around a wind farm one would be able to hear the noise they produce. Not only are wind farms noisier than a small jet plane, but the turbines could alsos cause lightning damage. If one comes close to a wind mill without the proper saftey gear one could become deaf. The noise from a small jet plane is above 121htz of sound. Anything higher than 150 can cause deafness. A windmill is if not five then ten times louder than the engine of a small jet plane. Wind farms cause noise pollution which over time can become potentially dangerous to ones health.]]>

Out of all sources of power generation wind is the most unreliable. Wind turbines are limited to being built in areas of the country that have enough wind to make their construction worth the price. Even in these areas the wind comes and goes; wind does not blow 24/7. Additionally, turbines' production is closely related to wind speed- a 10% drop in wind speed lowers power production by 25%. This makes turbines even more affected by variations in the wind. Efficiency isn't the only problem with wind power, they are also a threat to the landscape and the people who live in it. Nobody wants a several hundred foot tall white-painted tower with spinning turbines on the horizon. The construction of wind turbines also requires the demolition of trees and flattening of the landscape to be places, scarring the countryside. Even more troublesome, the noise of gigantic turbines spinning is unpleasant to local residents. Wind Power may seem like a green source of energy at first, but it is inefficient for the cost and troublesome to the environment and its people. Its relatively sparse usage is not just slow adjustment to green energy; it is well thought out. Green energy sources will have to come from another source; Wind Power is far too inefficient to be massively relied on.]]>

It also has massively huge, noisy wings that go wuss wuss wuss whenever the stupid thing is running. Wind turbines are bad for now until they come up with a better, more silent, less bird killing design.]]>

Wind energy is a clean source of energy that can be easily obtain but, based off the given information, it is an even bigger disadvatnge of having wind energy then it woud be as an advatage. Firstly, the disadvantage of wind energy is the wind itself. Wind is not a constant source, meaning that it is not always blowing all the time. Wind speed varied by 10% while turbine power varies by 25%. This would but many citizens at lost when their energy source isn't present. Energy source should be fueled by one of more consistency. Furthermore, windmills are an annoyance and problem to not only rural areas, but also the area and environment around it. The blades of the mills are very noisy, creating noise pollution. Windmills itself also cause landsape of rural areas to be unaapealing to the eye. In addition, windmills endager wildlife creatures such migrating birds with its blades. There are too many disadvantages to windmills than advantages. Windmills shouldn't be used, but maybe used and adapted into an better improvement.]]>

But the disadvantages of wind mills are a lot more then we all think that they are. Here are some disadvantages to having wind mills. One of these disadvantages are that the wind is not blowing all the time in all the areas that they put them in. Another example is that if you have a wind farm the noise that they will produce is the same noise as a small jet engine, no one wants to hear that noise when they get back home to relax and sleep,it would be too much to handle if there is a small community that lives near by. It will also effect the endangered wildlife that surrounds the wind mills,and all of the migrating birds that will be passing by the wind mills. Thats what i think are the disadvantages of wind mills and the effects that it could have on this community,we should not relay on just one power source to make all of our energy that will not be working 24/7.]]>

In fact, our modern technology is more efficient. How can wind energy be so effective when the wind doesn't always blow, and sometimes faster than other times? If we had more wind farms today, wildlife would be endangered, especially when bird begin to migrate. The blades on the windmills are large and having so many would take up space reducing buildings and other man-made structures. Also, we'd need room for the wind farms, therefore, forests would be cut down, another reason for endangered wild life. Higher climates relates to more wind, where many of these windmills would be built, occupying mountain areas. Windmills would be everywhere! Why? In order for the windmills to produce enough energy for everyone's homes there would need to be many of them. Another disadvantage to the windmill idea is that the blades are noisy. The turbines are large and have an ugly design to them, ruining landscapes. In conclusion, electricity today and the technologies that produce it work more efficiently than windmills have. Yes, there are power outages, but the wind doesn't always blow either, meaning windmills wouldn't always do the job.]]>

Lastly, the student states that it would endanger wildlife, in which what if a flock of birds are migrating and the end up in the way of the blades of the windmill?

Too much wind and tall windmills also have an effect on birds. Their migration has been increasing in such parts of having windmills because of their flight routes and being in the way. Also, having to cut down trees plays a part on them declining in nunbers in different parts of the country. They are a good source for getting energy from wind, but havent they thought about the massive space they need to be created? That space can be used for other resourceful things, such as buildings or just to have more greenery and wildlife. It would be more of a good idea if they were made to be a smaller contruction and not be so much in the way of nature or even humanlife.

It is true that the wind will not always be blowing all the time, but we can strategically place the turbines in high altitudes with large amounts of wind as to maximize the rotation amount of the turbines. Yes, wind speeds may vary by 10% but we will optomize that 10% with location. With these blades it is also said to be very noisy. We are able to also relocate these turbines in places unpopulated by humans and large amounts of wild life. This will reduce the distrubance to everyone and make it more convinent for them. Speaking of wild life, it is said that these turbines may prove to be obstructions to forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. They may also be hazards to endangered wildlife and migrating birds, proving to be obsticales in their path of flight. We can avoid harming the wildlife by decreasing the speed of rotation of the turbines, but increasing the amount of power generated from a spin cycle. This will steady the balance between the power being generated and the harm to the environment. In respect to noise pollution, there are some sacrafices that we must take if we want to take this course of action. I do not believe noise pollution from wind farms is that big of a consequence, though.]]>

Here are some counterclaims about wind power. When you use wind power you have to solelly rely on the wind, there are days where the wind doesn't doesn't blow enough to produce a large amount of energy to a city or neighborhood. Placing wind mill farms in places that does not get enough wind isn't beneficial to that city because they will not be able to produce enough energy to power the city. Many claim that the blades tend to be extremely noisy, which causes noise pollution. Many people that may live close to a wind farm may not want to hear the blades in the middle of the day or at night if the wind is blowing. They are also not appeasing to the eye. Many people that live in rural areas do not want their beautiful farmland and landscape to be ruined by these enormous and ugle turbines. Another point that people bring up is the danger that these turbines bring to wildlife. When birds begin to migrate south for the winter they are becoming entangled into these turbines which is causing us to decrease the amount of birds that we have. Many plants, and areas rely on birds for their various resources. Alsi people feel that it is an obsruction to our forrest, mountains, building, ad other man-made infostructures. In order to use wind power you need an area to put these turbines in, so many of the people that constuct these turbines cut down forrests, buildings and blow up mountains to put them in these places.]]>

They do also have noisy blades, but that's why they put them in rural areas so it doesn't disturb that many people unless you live out in the sticks. The windmills maybe ugly but the way that they are desigened is for them to help produce a clean source of energy. Usually they place a bunch of windmills together so it doesnt ruin to much of the ruaral landscape and so the other windmills help eachother out. So if one is spinning a lot it will cuase the other one to spin too because when the wind hits them and they spin the windmill causes more wind also.]]>

It is good because it doesnt cause pollution.The wind power does not blow 24/7, It also endagers wild life like birds. They are very dangerous and can cause alot of disasters if something wrong goes on and you live close to one of them .I think that wind power panels are good to a certain extent but not around citys with a big popularity. We should have the wind powers were we are not closer to them just because it helps us get energy . Wind powers can be usefull in other ways for people who need electricity since it helps with the energy it is easy for people to get it that way. The disadvanteges are alot but their are also many advantages that is why they shouldnt have these wind powers closer to us. They need to keep them farther away from big cities so nothing can go wrong. It depends on many things.

Since windmills are powered by wind, what happens on days that, well, there is no wind? Windmills can't function without wind, therefore they are not a consistent power source. We need something that lasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Along with their inconsistency, the wind speed can vary by 10% as well as the turbine power varying by 25%. Being such giant metal structures, they are extremely vulnerable to lightning strikes which can damage the windmill leaving it immobilized. Not only that, but those massive blades are really quite noisy. So what is the solution to noisy blades, put them where no one will hear them right? Wrong. These massive windmills ruin rural lanscape. They obstruct forests, mountains, even buildings, and due to their immense size, can interfere and endanger wildlife like migrating birds.

Wind power is generated using windmills. An abundance of these windmills can create many obstructions to everyday life and ruin what we have of our enviornment. Windmill farms are, as the name suggests, made up of a large amount of windmills. One windmill is loud but several together, all running at once becomes a hinderance to the citizens located nearby. These turbines also play a part in completely destroying, what little we have, of our country's rural landscape. These gigantic machines prove to be just obstructions in our forests, mountains, and even to the buildings and other man-made structures that a lot of time, space and money have been poured into. If more windmills are constructed more land and areas will be taken up endangering wildlife, as well as, taking needed space for homes and businesses. These windmills need to be tall and wide creating a hazard to migrating birds who are necessary to maintain a stable ecosystem/enviornment. As seen before in many cases of human involvement in wildlife, losing a population of animals can throw a whole enviornment off-balance and start a chain reaction of failed ecosystems. These turbines do not guarantee a consistent amount of energy will be provided. According to research, wind speed varies by 10%, while turbine power varies by 25%. Wind is an unpredictable element and the guarantee of energy will not always be positive. Not only this but, these expensive contraptions can easily be targeted and destroyed by natural disasters such as lightning storms. This weakness can waste millions of dollars.]]>

Turbines utilized the endless power of wind whch on some days can be particularly fierce. They have powered up to 12 million homes in 2012 and can be placed any where with stronger winds to maximize effiencey. However they are not as effective as solar energy which utilizes the endless power of the sun. They are also subject to wind speeds which can be non existent on some days. They are also a wildlife hazard. Flocks of migrating birds might be negatively affected if they fly into a turbine. Solar power has none of these problems and all the advantages.

A question i may ask about this is how are you gonna power huge cities by this? You cant put the windmills there they're too huge and will disrupt the city life. With sun it's always there, with wind it comes and goes, so tell me now which one sounds better?

Windmills do not blow 24/7, instead varying theit power output with the will of the wind. In many areas where wind farms are set up, wind speed can vary up to ten percent and the turbine's power output can vary up to twenty five percent. This makes it difficult to guarantee the amount of power produced by windmills during any given period of time. In addition, windmills frequently disrupt the landscape around them. People are discouraged from living near wind farms due to their unbearable noise. Windmills are equivalent to small jet engines in terms of sound and cause an incredible amount of noise pollution. Their imposing figure and distasteful design ruin the rural landscape around them and make them unpleasant to live near. Also, turbine blades rotating at high speeds pose a danger to migrating birds and can be damaged or destroyed when struck by lightning.

For example, some downfalls would be that they have noisy blades, endagered wild life, etc. They're beneficial because windpower is free and it generates enough energy for large number of people. It doesn't generate pollution or radioactive waste. It doesn't consume any non-renewable resources. Examples would be coal, natural gas, and oil.

Windmills do have their disadvantages. America is more idustrialized than it use to be back in the 1920 or the 1800's. Mostly everyone in this modern time needs their electricity. There are chances that the windmill might not work all the time. If the windmill doesn't work all the time it will leave people that need to do important stuff, like work, with out electricity. This will cause people to have to wait for their electicity to turn back on. Adding to this are the noisy blades that will leave people around the windmill restless and tired, because they can't get enough sleep. Windmills can also endanger wildlife. Because windmills are so big they can get in the way of migrating animals in the sky, particularly. When birds migrate they are not acustomed to seeing these big windmills with turning blades. The birds might not even realize they are a danger to them. If the birds do see it this way they might just run into one of the blades causing them to die. Because windmills can endanger animals and won't always give you energy, 24/7, we can't always rely on them to work.]]>

The machines that converts this type of energy, however, can be troublesome towards the environment. Although windmills are needed to produce energy, it can cause an obstruction in the area. If living near wind farms, you can hear the sound of windmills. At some time, their propellers aren't rotating. But when they do, they produce a loud sound that can be disturbing to others. Sound is common from these energy converting machines. But in an operating state, it can be viewed as an annoyance to the area. Another issue that affects the surrounding area is the windmill itself. Turbines are tall generators that expand across the hillside. Design shouldn't be a concern, but a machine its size can be an obstruction to nearby cities and rural areas. Many forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures had to be torn down in order to establish wind farms. The construction with such a design can endanger wildlife. Even the wind that the turbines produce can affect migrating birds, for example. Another danger turbines face are lightning storms. Since turbines are constructed out of metal, these machines can conduct electricity, causing machines to malfunction and may affect other areas of the wind farm. Since turbines are wind-base machines, they can also produce pollution. With wind speeds that varies from 10% and the rotating turbine power of 25%, who knows how far the pollution can be carried through the air. These machines operate similar to a small jet engine. Just like airplanes, the air flow they produce can affect the air around us. Moreover, they can affect any neighboring households.]]>

It was shown that in 2012, these wind turbines produced about 3% of all electricity in the U.S. People think it will reduce the use of other damaging sources of energy but there are a few disadvantages of wind energy that could be very vital and equally as damaging. Some disadvantages of wind energy is knowing that it will not be windy 24/7. It won't produce the amount of energy we need and it is not a reliable source for our enviornment. The Windmills itself are abnormally big and the blades will be too noisy, so if placed near a city or neighborhood, it will cause a distraction and the people will be unhappy. Since the windmills are so large, it will cause the producers of the windmill to need more space and obstruct more forests and mountains than we already have to place their windmills. Not only that, but it will endanger migrating birds. When flying, the birds may not see the windmill and may fly straight into it. New technology is trying to improve and better our planet but it actuality, it is causing more damage to our enviornment through those disadvantages.]]>

Another pro of having windmills to provide energy is the fact that wind is continually renewable, and provides permanent energy. However, these wind farms create noise pollution and affect the way birds migrate. Another con is that the construction of wind farms causes the destruction of obstrucions such as forests and other important factors that make up the enviroment. I think the construction of these wind farms benefit on the concept of eco-friendly energy, but cause damage as well. In paragraph 3 it says,&quot;Wind power is free and in abundance in certain areas especially where wind speeds are alaways higher such as on the shoreline, at the top of a hill, and in places free of obstructions.&quot; I fully agree with this sentence but places where there is wind is usually parks, and places where there are trees. In order to create wind farms the demolition of trees would have to take place. Therefore I think we should really on a different source of energy that doesn't affect the planet, ior cause the destruction of an ecosystem.]]>

One of the ways we receive our energy is from wind power. There are many benefits from using wind power to generate energy but there is also some downfalls to it. Some of the benefits are the amount of energy we can generate from can be used by a large number of people. It is also encouraged for its renewable energy. Even with these benefits is it really worth it? To generate this kind of energy you need wind, and wind is not blowing constantly. This means that it is not a reliable resource. The windmill blades can be very dangerous. They are like sails, with the effect of the wind of airplane wings, creating a lift causing them to rotate. Birds and other animals can be damaged but these huge blades. Other wild life can be damage also because you need a place to put these massive windmills. They have destroyed many forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. We only have one earth and its beautys; by putting in these windmills it ruins the landscape and its wonders. Nature is suppose to be a quiet and peaceful place but these windmills have very noise blades, which ruins the atmosphere. In conclusion windmills should not be produced anymore because of all the issues it causes for our enviroment.]]>

Those blades are just way to noisy, at what cost? Helping make a renewable, alternate way of power? Even if these Windmills were a good thing and weren't so ugly we'd have to destroy forests buildings, and even other things and there's no other way to do it. What are they going to do? put these windmills in someplace where they aren't destroying anything, like plains or flat lands? If someone ever came up with that idea, I would laugh in their face. And seriously my biggest issue is that it doesn't run 24/7, it probably only runs a little bit less than that! So what we know about windmills is that they're ugly, they have blades, even if they were good we'd obviously have to destroy forest's and building (NO OTHER WAY), they kills animals (I really can't explain how they kill animals), the windmills are not running forever, ect... So if you're thinking about supporting idea these are the reason not to. In the end it just isn't worth it. Disclaimer: If you didn't realize this was completely sarcastic I fail you]]>

Windmills are also much larger than regular electrical towers, taking up more land with less energy being generated from each one.

First lets adress noise pollution, these windmills look quiet enough but they are not in fact quiet, the are actually pretty loud and annoying. The noise is produced by the blades of the windmill which are almost always in motion. If you happen to be close to one you would be amazed at how you can't hear yourself think,now if you live close to one you wouldn't be able to sleep. Second, these wind turbines endanger wildlife, more specificlly birds and bats. So many flying animals die due to the blades of the windmills at tghe cost that we will recieve energy. These animals dont deserve to die this way, man kind is already destroying there habitats there is no need to build more sturctures that pose a threat to the wildlife. On top of all this they are also not very stylish, they have an ugly design that ruins rual landscapes. Therefore while it may seem like this project has no drawbacks it does so rethink.]]>

This is caused due to the obstruction of forests, and mountains to build these clunky, noisy, poorly designed wind farms. Not only do the animals lose their home, but they also are faced with new surroundings such as noisy blades, and jet turbines which could cause serious harm to them. This causes animals to migrate irregularly. Furthermore, Wind energy, although it is abundant, it is not gurranted to produce energy all the time.

Firstly, the turbines are large, noisy, and ruin the natural landscape in which they are placed. The sound produced by a wind farm is comparable in decibels to that of a small jet engine. Not only do they obstruct views and create annoyance, but they are a danger to wildlife. Migrating birds are frequently caught and killed in the large, fast moving blades. Much of the time, when wind is low, the turbines sit dormant and produce no energy at all. Lastly, as they are large, metal towers, turbines can frequently be struck by lightning and heavily damaged.]]>

People do not think about how much it can take and actually cost to make one of these. You never know it might be harming something important, we might need that resource. I think we should use different alternatives for the use of electricty. Based off information, it can ruin peoples daily lives. What if someone lives near by an wind powered source. Since the blades are very noisy, it can cause huge distubance to people living in the area. Not to mention the engine that doubles the sound. Further more, it would cost thousands to build one, damaging our economy. My next reason is it affects our enviroment. The fact that you have to put it up in multiple different places is a problem. You have to put it in different places to produce electricty throughout the city. This will cause us to knock down trees, by this it will disturb or kill animal life. The heat produced by the engines can make a wildfire which is killing more life. This will take away our natural resources we may need. Again, it may also effect the people who love to enjoy the wilderness. Sometimes the wind energy may not be working twenty-four seven.]]>

Only 3% of the total population in the &quot;U.S&quot; is getting wind power in 2012. How often do they get that energy, and for how long can they depend on that energy for. Yes we have upgraded alot from the 1900's and it may not be the best way for the world, however we live in a world now where we live very fast. If it's not as fast as people live there lives now and days then it's pointless and useless. Think about cell-phones. You may not always need it but when you do, you want something fast and effective. As commercials now and days may see I would compare wind power to the Metro phone service. Very slow, unreliable, and you can't count on it to always be there for you when your in certain situations, but it's still used by a portion of the &quot;U.S&quot; population, and in a very small way effective. However when it comes to other energy resources used today like PG and others, which may be alittle harming for the world than windmills, I would compare it to the Verizon phone service, because it's super effective, can be used almost everywhere and or anywhere in the U.S, which a huge portion of the &quot;U.S&quot; population has, it just makes more sense to go with what is more useful.]]>

This expansion has been welcomed by many as an important innovation in sustainable energy. However, we must all ask ourselves: &quot;are these windmills really as fantastic as we are all led to believe?&quot;. The answer to this question may surprise many as there are several lesser known factors that make wind energy more of a liability than an asset for the world many wish for it to support. Fisrt of all, these wind turbines are detremental to bird population. This point should seem obvious as a bird can hardly be expected to navigate a field of what can sometimes be hundreds of wind turbines and emerge unhamed on the other side. This could create more endangered birds in a world where wildlife is already struggling, or worse, drive already endangered species' closer to, or even completely to, extinction. This brings up the point of the greater inefficiency of wind turbines. When birds hit the such turbines, it may damage the turbine as well causing a need for constant maintainance. When added to the danger of lightning damage, and the difficulties of finding an unemcumbered area large enough for an amount of turbines to generate any worthwhile amount of energy, it becomes evident that wind energy is more trouble than it's worth. Finally, it should be mentioned that, not only is wind energy dangerous to bird populations and considerably inefficient, but it also causes for the people living in the rural areas where the turbines are located. For example, the enourmous blades used to generate the energy may also generate an intollerable amount of noise for the local population. This is additionally hindering when considering that the turbines also double as big, ugly poles that ruin an otherwise pristine rural landscape. As one can infer from these arguments, wind energy, while a nice idea, is far from being the green dream many envision it to be.]]>

Also they dont have much use anymore besides blowing in the wind. The student that made this claim has a point although the turbines are renewable resources, yet that is the only thing it is good for.

Not only that, but wind speed varies constantly by 10% and the turbine power also varies by a large 25%. These turbines are not worth the time if the're possibly unreliable at times. For example, if lightning struck a turbine, it would cost to replace it and it would be a loss in the energy that was being collected before. These turbines are being placed in beautiful rural landscapes; it is ruining the effect of the land with their very large and ugly design. They constantly stand as a possible hazard for wildlife; such as birds migrating along a path that is obstructed by the turbines. Not only are they an obstruction of wildlife, but they are also a disturbance of; natural forests and mountains, and buildings and other man made structures.

Meaning whille people are creating more inventions and new things to use to make life more easier, people forget about how this all started. Back in the american colonie ages people had to use windmillds in order for them to keep growing food on their farm. These windmills were mainly used in areas like more western and mid-western to enhans engery for their crops. Now since technologie is taking over and advancing its more easier for them to keep producing their own crops, but then yet the student asserts that &quot;windmill blades are like sails&quot;. Causing wind to gernrate energy, but with out an windmill how are farmers going to get energy sources?. Well thats when technology kicks in wind energy is a power source for anybody with a farm or anything im suggesting. From what the text had it said clearly that &quot; wind can become the sole source of power during times when the electrical gird is out, or when the]]>

We cannot fully rely on wind energy because it does not blow 24/7 and wind speed varies by 10%, with turbine power varying by 25%. Having to rely fully on wind energy would be like a hit or miss, which is not acceptable to today's demands. Not only is wind energy unreliable, it also destroys the landscapes due to its size and causes wild life to be endangered. It would be devastating for communities to endure the destruction of their landscapes. Depending on wind energy can be very disastrous for the environment, and does not work all the time.]]>

                           <Item_Response><![CDATA[Although wind turbines may be a greener energy source, there are problems that will make wind power ineffective. First, the weather is unpredictable. Wind may not blow 24/7. There will be times when the wind will not be able to blow. If there is no wind, then there is no power. Also, the wind speed varies between each day. The wind speed varies by 10%, which causes turbine power to vary by 25%. So one day the wind will be blowing very hard and fast, but the next day, the wind may not blow that hard. That means that one day, a town may have an abundance of electricity, but the next day, they may not have enough to power everything that reqiures electricity. Next, wind turbines have noisy blades that can cause noise pollution if there is enough of them. In fact, wind farms generate enough noise equivalent to a small jet engine. That will make it harder for residents to perform activities that require a quite setting. Lastly, wind turbines can be a danger to the enviroment. The turbines are too big, they have an ugly design, and they ruin rural landscape. Since the wind is more powerful at greater heights, the wind turbines need to be tall to recieve as much wind power as possible. Because of this, animals such as birds are risk of rinning into the turbine blades and dying. Also, the turbines can act as a lightning rod during thunder storms. This can also danger wildlife that live close to wind farms. With these problems concerning wind turbines, I believe we should just stick to what we have been using to generate our electricity.]]>

One of the reasons wind turbine isn't as good of an energy source compared to something like hydroelectricity is that the wind doesn't always blow 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; where as the ocean currents never stop and are a continuous source of energy. Another complication associated with wind turbines are that they are too big and have to placed upon a hill near a strong source of the wind's current, when this is done it takes up a lot of space and gives many animals less space to graze around. Plus they just look straight out ugly. The last big issue with wind turbines are that if a group of migratory birds were to be flying around many would die as they would get chopped up and die due to the wind turbines' blades.]]>

This article is a good prelude to all of the benefits we will recieve from converting to wind energies. However, America is not currently prepared to take on such a large task. Nuclear power is also recieving advancements in its field, which increases its output and reduces its toxicity and threat to the environment.

First of all, while the sun shines consistently every day and crude oil imports are scheduled, wind flow is unpredictable without advanced weather instruments. Thus, there may be periods of &quot;wind droughts&quot; when a reigon experiences no wind. For those small communities that place their dependence completely on wind power, they might experience long periods of power outages that cripples them. Another key disadvantage to wind power is pollution. In the traditional sense, pollution is mainly associated with carbon dioxide exhaust or toxic waste. Using this outdated definition, some proponents for wind farms claim that wind power produces no pollution. They, however, overlook noise pollution. The noise produced from a wind farm rivals that of a small jet engine. Like CO2 emissions or toxic waste, noise pollution distrubs the sourrounding environment of the wind farm and has detrimental effects on the wildlife there, many of which rely on their sense of hearing to survive. Thus, while wind power does carry advantages, it also has significant setbacks.]]>

As the wind speed varies by ten percent, turbine power varies twenty five percent. This means that if the wind speed slightly changes, the turbine looses a quarter of its power. Finally, the turbines are a danger to wildlife, especially migrating birds. Not only are they able to slice many birds up, but they also change the wind pattern which can really affect the bird while migrating. It is clear that there are more sufficient means of creating energy than windmills. These other ways, such as nuclear, are more effective, as they generate more energy at a consistent rate. This proves why wind energy is unreliable and unnecessary.]]>

As late as the 1920s, Americans used small windmills to generate eletricity in rural areas that lacked electrical service. Over the last decade, wind energy has become one of the most costpeffective emerging technologhies. Many areas in the western and mid-western United Stats hasbe taken advantage of this innovative technology by creating large collections of windmills called wind farms. Windmill blades are like sails that turn in the wind and generate energy. Much like the effect of the wind on airplain wings, wind flows ofer the blades creating lift causing them to rotate. The blades connect to a drive shaft that turns an electric generator to produce electricity. Wind is a clean sourc of energy, and overall, the use of wind for energy has fewer enviromental impacts than using many other energy sources. Wind Power is free and in abundance in certain areas especially where wind speeds are always highers such as on the shoreline, at the top of a hill, and in places free of obstructions. Wind Power does not generate pollution or radioactive waste. It does not consume any of the non-renewable resources such as coal, natural gasm or oil. wind is a contunually renewable and permanent energy. Wind becomes the sole source of power during times the the electrical grid is out, especially when enduring hurricanes, power outages, or BROWN OUTS? Wind is an excellent supplement to other renewable resoures such as solar and hydroelectric power. Wind power wind power wind wpoer wind poer wnd poer wind pwr wndpwr wlkfsd power]]>

Wind energy and the wind turbines they utilize to generate energy cause noise pollution, are not effective and are very large compared to their surroundings. The turbine it self is a large structure with a small jet engined attached at the top, compared to the surrounding infrastructure it is ugly. Another issue concerning their size is the danger they present to the migration paths of certain animals. The large amount of space the blades take up and the speeds at which they turn can kill any bird or animal that comes in contact with the blades. Apart from the issues witht the generators, the turbines can also be very inffevtive. They do not run 24/7 which cuts the amount of energy they can produce. However, if they do run 24/7 they can over heat and destroy the turbine. Their production also depends on the wind; if there is no wind there is no energy being produced. Overall, wind turbines cause more issues than good they contribute to clean energy production. The ineffectiveness and uselessness of wind turbines outweighs their movement for the use of clean energy. The large wind turbine farms do produce energy but they do not produce the maximum they can. Their limited operation hours and vast amount of space taken up can be used better with other sources of energy. With the amount of space they take up, other power plants can be contructed that will result in similar amount of energy, if not more, and cause less problems. Using other forms of energy, clean or not, will cause less direct harm to wildlife and will probably cause less issues concerning the turbine. Alternate forms will also not depend on atmospheric conditions to be able to produce energy. In conclusion, it will be better to invest the money spent on wind turbines on other forms to get the most out of the initial investment of money and space.]]>

Many complain of the noise they make. Inorder for turbines to generate the power they do, they must be fairly large. But this large size is consitered rather ugly in rural landscapes. The size presents other challanges as well. For instance fitting a huge turbine in the middle of a dense forest is quite impractical. As impractical as putting a turbine in a crowded city, where the power is really needed. Even when there is wind available, it is a far from constant source of energy. Wind speeds vary by 10% which translates to a more serious 25% difference in power from the turbine.Turbine blades have been described as being shaped like an airplane's wings causing them to spin quickly. However no where was it mentioned that this fast spinning also creates sustantial noise pollution, equivalent to a small jet engine. It has been mentioned that a wind turbine is especialy effective when a hurricane wipes out other sources of power. However a hurricane would also destroy a wind turbine as it draws lightning to itself and causes expensive damage. If one moves away from problems caused to humans, then one finds a large danger to the animal population.Migrating birds are unable to distinguish fast moving turbine blades from ordinary sky, and ususpectinly fly directly into turbines. The energy derived from wind is cleaner than many other sources, however one must consider the drawbacks along with the benefits.]]>

Also, it is not aways windy, so the energy production will vary based on the amount of wind moving the windmills. Also, these windmills have very noisy blades and are not very pretty to look at, which would cause for people not to want to live near them, or be dissatisifed if they are put in near their houses. Windmills also are very very big and take up a lot of space.The wind mills would take away space for forests, buildings and other man-made structures. These things can also prevent the wind wills from working effectively. Windmills are also very dangerous. They get in the way of many animals natural habitat, killing some, or leaving them without homes. Also, windmills are likely to get struck by lightning, causing a very dangerous situation.

In today's society , we do not need water pumps or windmills to grind wheat and corn we have stores , deli's and markets that do it for us so there's no need to get all of that stuff when you can just buy it ready . Also , we do not need sawmills to genereate electricty becauase we have electrical pole lines that run it into our house to use it . If we start to use wind turbins instead it would be a great idea because in the text it states that wind turbines in the united states generated 3% of use electricity giving about 12 million households electricty . But if you start to make wind turbines you have to cut down forest and flatten land out which can kill animals and that may put animals in danger of being extinct. There will also be loud noise from the wind turbines which may seem to be annoying because then it can be loud enough to wake you up through the night . There's also pollution because there is small jet engines which can cause pollution to the enviorment .]]>

As a result, they won't always be blowing 24/7 and this can lead to a shortage of energy for people who rely on them for all their energy needs. The wind speed will also vary at times; the wind won't constantly be blowing extremely strong. The turbine power will vary by 25% or more because of the wind variations. This also leads to a shortage or lack of energy. Finally, obstructions such as forests, mountains, buildings and other structures can block the path of wind. The wind will not have a direct path to the windmill, and will also result in a shortage of energy. Not only will the windmills possibly have problems with not creating enough energy, but they create noise pollution and ruin the nature they are built in. They can have noisy blades that become an issue with the enviornment. The noise pollution on wind farms can be equivlent to a small jet engine. Nobody wants to hear that much noise throughout the day and night. The turbines are also very big. They have an ugly design and ruin the natural looks of a rural landscape. Finally, they endanger wildlife and migrating birds. The construction of wind farms takes away the animals' habitats, and leaves them endangered and in harms way with the turning windmill.]]>

It is also an endagerment to wild life and it is too noisy. Windmill energy has a very important flaw the wind. The wind does not blow all day and that is a bid problem because it is run on wind energy. On a normal day the wind varies at ten percent, the windmill varies by twentyfive percent. That is a huge difference and the biggest problem that this sort of energy has. Yes, there are places that are more windy than others and are able to use this energy almost daily but it does not work for everyone. Having a very big and tall windmill in the middle of the sky can endanger wildlife such as birds. Birds sore high in the sky and can get caught in the middle of one. Lets say the wind is blowing strongly and the windmill is very powerfull the wind can pull in the bird without warning and the bird is powerless against it's power. Wind mills are also very noisy, it disturbes the quiet for people who are still sleeping. If you have work early in the morning you wouldn't want to be woken up by a very loud noise through most of the night. It causes noise pollution. It may not cause air pollution but it is a disturbance of peace.]]>

That means days hours going by with no electricity. If the cities, nations or the whole world depended on wind energy, we would have multiple blackouts every now &amp; then. Also, the building of multiple wind turbines could possibly endanger the environment. To fit several of them in one place would mean the destruction of forests and removal of certain buildings. To make a safe environment for construction workers, it would include endangerment or killing of specific wildlife that roam those areas. The large spinning turnbines on the top of several of these machines in one large area could even harm migrating birds. Dependence on wind power could possibly put the environment &amp; nature at risk. Most importantly, theres questions on how efficient will these turbines be or will there be problems.

The wind is not always constant, and in dry areas there could barely be any wind at all. How will they get their wind energy if there isn't any? Machines would have to be built for wind power to occur and this is a major disturbance to wildlife. This can effect the way wild life lives and how they find food and shelter. Yes, wind energy is a money saver but at the same time it could destroy our wilf life animals and rural landscapes.

There will be many occassions where the wind will not be blowing which will not work to our advantage. The speed will also vary which will effect how much power we get. Wind speed varies by 10% and turbine power variesby 25%, so this Also the noise from the blades are very loud. No one will want to buy property around the wind turbines because of the booming sound it makes. This might cause the community economy to collaspe. In addition to the loud noise, turbines are too big, are ugly, and ruin rural landscape. The turbines require a lot of space, so there is a large possibility for houses, buildings, or farms to be taken down and replaced. These buildings can possibly provide jobs for many families. So if turbines replace these buildings than families would have to unemployment. Forests and mountains would have to be tackled too if turbines were to take their place. Destroying these forests and mountains can ruin habitats and create endangered species. Deforestation has many disadvantages like soil erosion, lack of biodiversity, and cause a shortage of oxygen. If turbines replaced forests then there will be a higher chance of flooding because the trees help to hold water. With the forests gone, it will cause birds to migrate and many other species to migrate. These species might turn into evasive species and have devastating effects on other species or regions. Installing these turbines have a trickling effect on many other things.]]>

People who live near these giant turbines complain about the noise externality it creates as it slowly churns away, trying to produce enough energy for a small population to use. No one wants a jet engine constantly working above their household. As well, these oversized fans are unable to be used in all locations, as places where wind is scare, these fans will just end up being a waste of money because they will not be able to work. The externality created by the wind turbines as well as the fact that they do not work in all areas proves that the energy created by them is negligible to the amount of energy we really need. In the above essay, the student compares the wind turbine mechanism to that of a jet. He is correct; the fan is like a jet, for the amount sound they both produce is similar. And this is a sound that people often complain about because it is too loud. This then leads to the people in the area to abandon their old homes in search of new ones, away from the loudness, where they can get some peace and quiet. These turbines overall do not make the people who live next to them happy. To go along with this, the fans do not even work in all areas of our country, they only work on the coast. The student above writes, &quot;Wind Power is free and in abundance in certain areas especially where wind speed are alwasy higher such as on the shoreline, at the top of a hill, and in places free of obstructions&quot;. This criteria is hard to follow, especially when other forms of energy such as fossil fuels can be accessed in an instant, no matter where the location is. All of this and wind only makes up about 3% of the U.S.'s entire energy forum? This means that fossil fuels will remain supreme for the next decade or so at least.]]>

Sure, wind turbines create an energy that is eco-friendly, but it isn't available all the time or for all people. It wouold be great to have wind turbines if there is a shortage of gas and oil, but what good will they do if there's no wind. Turbine powers can vary by 25%, and that number can change even more when you factor in the 10% variation in wind speed! On top of this, wind turbines create hazards for birds. How eco-friendly can something really be if it is responsible for decimating wild-life populations?]]>

There are no switches to turn off that switch, your going to have to listen to that all night long.Lastly, the obstruction this windmill will take, you might be tearing down forests, moutains, buildings, or any other man-made structures.

The structure itself obscures the landscape. Many complain that they would not like the structures within their sight or near there property even though they like the benefits of having them. if moany are ojecting to having them near there houses, then very few are being built which, in turn, revesrses the benefits of having one.

In order for wind turbines to work, there needs to be wind, which does not always blow across all parts of land, and some parts are even further depraved of wind breezes. If there is a black out, it is not guaranteed that there will be wind to create back up electricity. Another issue to take into consideration is that they are large and have requirements for how much land they need to be able to be placed in certain locations, and some locations are not large enough. One more problem that comes up with these turbines is the issue that they cause a lot of noise, and although there are cities that are already loud enough where people are used to a lot of noise, turbines in quieter, more rural areas would disturb the people who live there because they are considerably loud. Therefore, they are not the solution to all of the problems that are experienced with electricity in America.]]>

Birds will not realize that they should not fly near these tall spinning turbines. All of these problems hurt the surrounding inhabitants. These turbines do not create the most efficient energy out there. The blades will not blow 24/7 because it is not always windy outside. Wind speed varies up to 10% making turbine power varie by 25%.

If people keep making them there would be a better world for everyone. The wind energy doesn't pollute the air as much as the energy we get from oil does. It shouldn't matter how nice or &quot;ugly&quot; the turbines look as long as it's good for the environment. Making this means it would help save more wildlife because there would be less oil plants which DO destroy the environment and the animals living in that specific area. If you make an oil factory in the ocean to extract the oil from the ground, that's putting endangered the fish in the water that reside in that part of the ocean. Not only that but it also pollutes the water. Let's take it back to when that oil spilled over the Golf of Mexico back a few years ago. So many innocent animals died due to this and so many others were affected by it. If people used more wind energy this would have never happened. In conclusion, I disagree with what the students have said. It shouldn't matter how &quot;ugly&quot; they look as long as they are providing us with energy and are helping the world to be better. It saves the life of many animals whose habitat have being destroyed by this oil factories. Let's make this a better world. A world that we should be proud of using as many natural resources as we can. Let's use the wind energy!]]>

Wind Power does not generate pollution or radioactive waste and it doesn't consume any of the non-renewable resources such as coal, natural gas, or oil.

While natural gas and nuclear power plants produce immense amounts of electricity, they have negative environment effects that are both immediate and long-term. With this in mind, companies have started to shift towards wind generated power sources like turbines and windmills. Wind generated power sources impact the environment in a more minute manner and are far more sustainable than sources akin to natural gas or coal which we have a limited supply of. While somes critics argue that wind power is just as harmful as the other sources, the argument is defeated. Even though wind power does have a negative impact on the environment, it becomes the lesser evil when looking at the different power sources that can be used to help power a nation or world.]]>

There are always complaints of annoyances of the windmills, polution, and destroyance of man made materials. Windmills are considered to be ugly and block the views that people love. Placing the windmills basically in someone's backyard is not only view upsetting but is definately an annoyance with the amount of noise it brings. Wind mills are not efficient and shouldn't be the main alternative source; Windmills do not blow 24/7 so you cannot really count on them powering your house with wind speeds very low at 10% and turbines only spin around 25%.]]>

When installing them it is harder to put them in a place where there is mountains, forest and buildings. They would need to be placed on a large open field or in the ocean as some have been displayed. The turbines can endanger wildlife and migrating birds.

Windmills are the biggest source of wind energy. When people think of windmills, they usually don't consider the pros and cons. If they do consider the pros and cons of windmills, they can probably think of more good they do than bad. But they do have some disadvantages that should not be over looked that could very well cause some problems in the future. Though they are very useful, they tend to have noisy blades and big turbines causing them to sound and look ugly which ruins one's veiw of a beautiful rural landscape. Since they are so big, they are also obstructions to forests, mountains, buildings, and other such things and with these places comes the wildlife within them. Due to windmills being such an obstructoin, some wildlife is becoming endangered and birds that are migrating tend to lose their homes. When thinking about windmills and the energy they provide, there is nothing wrong with them, but there are some things that could be improved to make them more eco friendly, although what's more eco friendly than wind? But in all seriousness, windmills could provide better friendliness to the habitats around them. By being less noisy, not as big, and controling when if blows would help greatly. It's the small things that make the biggest difference.]]>

Windmills don't always blow, due to sometimes no wind. But if you do your research, you can place windmills in places that are more prone to windy conditions and therefore make the windmills more worth the time and money. It is said that another con is that the turbines are too big, have an ugly design, and ruin rural landscape. If it is truly rural, then there usually shouldn't be too many people around to see the turbines. And honestly, who doesn't think the sight of giant windmills isn't fascinating?]]>

Wind mills are massive and obstruct beautiful rural areas. Most people who are on road trips usually enjoy the scenary such as mountains and forests, but cannot if these huge wind mills are built. Also it is easier for birds to get caught in one of the blade as they spin. This would decrease our bird population massively and would ruind our ecosystem. Another con to wind power is the noise that they create and that they have to use smell jet engines.Depending on the area you live in you won't always have wind blowing so it is very unreliable source of energy. It can only create about 10% of energy which is not enough to supply you for a whole year. Wind power is not a stable source of energy.]]>

Another problem is that winmills have to have their own space to operate. There can not be any outside obstruction influencing the winmills otherwise they will not work to their full potential.

As late as the 1920's, Americans used small windmills to generate electricity in rural areas that lacked electric service. IOver the last decade, wind energy has become on of the most cost-effective- emerging technologies. Many areas in the western and mid- western united states have taken advantage of this innnovative technology by creating large collections of winmills called wind fars. Windmill blades are like sails that truern in the wind and generate energy. Much like the effect of wind on airplane wings, wind flows over the blades creating lift causing them to rotate. The blades connedct to a drive shaft that runs and electic generator to produe electricty. Wind is a clean source of food, anc overall, the use of wind for food has fewer bodily impacts than using corn as bait for fish. Wind power is locked up and scarece in certain areas, mostly where elves roam the earth. when the dinosuars whiped out the volcanoes, they blossumed into this place called jurrasic park. i stepped on a frog and it turned into a nail, then i said ow, the same time as somebody else, and then i said jinx lah lah lah lah lah lah la h lahsldkf smart words and such.]]>

As you drive all of a sudden you see a big, ugly, metal tower with large apendages portruding from its face. Windmils are big, guady, noisy turbines that have been recently used to generate energy. While they do generate some amount of energy, the costs greatly outweigh the benifets. Windmills have a very low cost benifet output which means that the money you put into aquiring one and taking care of it is much more than the money you will make from the energy you produce. The windmills dont blow 24/7 and arent constantly producing energy. They are so big that there are many obstructions that would impede you form building one and to part those obstructions would be a very costly procedure. The turbines also create a large amount of noise pollution that can be a nuissance to surronding farms, the noise the windmill makes is comparable to that of a small jet engine. The turbines are normally placed around farms in big, green, hilly areas. These areas are generally considered asthetically appealing until an ugly windmill is placed to ruin the rural landscape. To conclude, I'd like to stress that there are enough buildings and towers that are ruining our landscape and windmills would just add to that number. I know that windmills are big, gaudy, noisy engines that, while they do generate some energy, the costs of erecting one greatly outweigh the benefits.]]>

The noise could interupt people in their homes and get many complaints. They sound like small jet engines and aren't the smallest of turbines. If it falls that will make one big blast tht can be heard for miles. Birds run into the turbines making it so the turbines aren't helping wildlife at all. One of them kills many birds a day. A year death toll is probably in the thousands for just one group.]]>

Since it is not always windy out, the wind turbines cannot always be used in certain areas. The places that offer the best possible area for wind are rural areas because they are large areas with no obstructions.

The cons of wind farms highly outweigh the pros. There are many other ways to generate electricity, and they should be used. Not only are these wind farms noisy, but they are also very unflattering to landscapes. They take up a lot of space and obstruct views of what lies beyond them. The turbines themselves creat a great deal of noise that can be quite bothersome, the noise of one wind farm can generate the same amount of sound as a small jet engine. Second, wind turbines can be dangerous as well as noisy. Migrating birds and other animals can potentially be harmed by the blades of the turbines and even the turbines themselves. Wind turbines are often the tallest objects in their immediate surroundings, mking them perfect tagrgets for lightning strikes. Last, wind energy is not always reliable and can't always be counted on to supply the needed amount of energy. Wind speeds are not always consistant, or even present at all. The wind may also be blocked or weakened by surrounding obstructions such as mountains, trees, or builings, renerding the wind turbines useless.]]>

Wind Turbines are large, often in groups, and are not appealing to the eye. Many are littered across the rural landscape, creating noise with their blades and obstructing forests, mountains, and other beautiful sites. Not to mention hese &quot;wind farms&quot; have a high likelyhood of killing off animals such as birds which also helps lead to the unappealing habitat. Another unfortunate truth about wind energy, is it is not efficient all the time. Wind is not always a constant and therefore there can be long periods of time when the blades are standing still and thus creating no energy. Secondly, speed of wind is ever changing (up to 10%) which can change the yeilded energy by 25%. Turbines also lose efficiency when they are struck by lightning, which is not an uncommon occurance. To wrap things together, wind turbines, although a good idea on paper, have lent themselves to show that they are cost inefficient, ugly for the environment, and potentially dangerous.]]>

The affectiveness of the turbines would also be affected by obstructions such as forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures. Another factor of the affectiveness of wind-generated power is wind speed, which varies by 10%, as well as turbine power which varies by 25%.

When there is no wind then what? They just sit there not doing a single thing. In 2012 the wind energy only gave 3% of the United States electricity. 3%? That is nothing, there are better and more efficent was to have renewable energy. From hydroelectric power to solar pannels.]]>

The noisy blades are very loud adn they just get loader the harder that the wind blows. Which makes it hard to have buildings close to it, because it is so loud. The turbines are large structures that take up a lot of room. When there is a windmill set up, people usually have to go in and cut down trees. Which then that means that you are cutting down the environment. The turbines are so big and have an ugly design that some poeple would not like to have them outside their window. Wind speeds vary by only 10% and the turbine powers generates 25%. You would get more energy with turbine powers than you would with windmills, because windmills rely on only the wind that is blowing. You will endanger wildlife because by cutting down the trees in the forest, you are taking away some of the animals homes. The small jet engine in the wind farms is putting polution into the air which is harming the animals around it.]]>

The wind may only blow occasionally, and even when it does, the force of the wind would not be significant enough to power homes. The wind would need to be blowing constantly and powerfully for the power it generates to have an effect on the total power needs of the United States. Not only would the wind not blow enough, but in some places, where there may or may not be an adequate amount of wind, a windmill may not be able to be set up there. The first obstacle would be moving the huge blades and stand to the location it needs to be set up. In mountainous areas, having huge semis carrying huge blades down sloping roads is not a good idea.

According to the students notes the wind turbines have noisy blades, and sometimes they can be dangerous to wildlife such as birds. Some people think that the wind turbine is too big, and it has an ugly design. I do agree that it is pretty big. Another disadvantage of wind energy is the wind turbine does not blow all the time (24/7) which some people want that because well of course they want energy all the time!]]>

Also the blades make sounds as the turn in the wind. This is why they don't have wind mills or windfarms near houses of towns becasue of the noise that they make. It's a very unpleseant noise that is constantly there when the wind is blowing. The noise that the wind farms generate are about the sound of a small jet engine. We wouldn't want to constantly hear a small jet engine every time the wind is blowing would we? We have beautiful landscapes so why would we want to add large turbines that stick out like a sore thumb and don't have a very pretty design to them. They ruin the true beauty of our landscapes. You also can't put the windmills or wind farms anywhere you'd like them to be there are many obsturctions. Such as forests, mountains, buildings, along with other man-made structures. You have to plan out where you can put them with out there being any obstructions. Wind speed and turbine power varie. Wind speed varies by 10% while turbine power varies by 25%. When they add the wind mills/wind farms to our landscapse we endager wildlife and migrating birds. We ruin their home land to add these wind mills. By adding these wind mills to their home land we could be pushing them out of it and making them migrate to a new enviorment that they aren't familar with and may eventually die off. Also migrating birds aren't used to these large wind mills and may often run into them in groups. Not just one at a time either a whole flock of these birds could. When we add these large metal turbines to our lands they also attracked lighting. Which causes lighting damage to the turbines along with the enviorment around them.]]>

First off, wind is not constant and is not reliable enough for the United States to put all of its faith into. The country can't just not have energy when the weather isn't cooperating. Also the blades are extremely noisy and are hard to live around. They disturb the peace and make for an uncomfortable place to live. The designs are not very attractive and take a lot away from the rural landscape. It is hard to find a place for the turbines also. They can't be too close to trees, buildings, mountains, or other man-made structures. Turbine power and wind speed are not directly proportional either. If wind speed varies by 10%, the turbine power varies by 25%. They could be a great danger to migratory birds too. They could be expensive to upkeep and could be damaged from lightning. They may not create pollution, but they are a nuance being as loud as a small jet engine.]]>

The size and shape of the turbines is very big and take up alot of space that could be used for farm land, or other agricultural purposes and are not the prettiest thing to look at. They ruin the landscape that is around them because it takes alot of work to make them and get them set up, so there would be alot of constuction equipement driving on the land and tearing it up. Once they are set up it is going to take alot of work to maintain them, so people would constintally have to go to it to work on it, and that would tear up the land even more. Turbines are also an endangerment to the wildlife around it, such as the birds and other animals. When a turbine is moving, a bird could possibly fly into it and get hurt, or an animal on the ground could accidentally get hit by one of the construction workers that is going to check on the turbine. Also, some people might not want the animals to be near the turbine so they would set up a fence around it and an animal could get caught in it and get hurt. So the animals in that area would be greatly affected by a wind turbine being set up in that area.]]>

A large problem about Wind turbines is that they take away from the land, such as a field. When putting up a wind turbing you must cut into farm land or other landscapes. While the wind power may not pollute the Earth with harmful fumes or gases it does give off wind polution which some people find very harmful. While you can always flip a switch to get power, you can not control how windy it will be! So without wind you do not have wind power.

Although wind energy does not cost much the turbines are very large and noticeable. Some people think wind turbines are ugly and ruin the natural land when set up around the world. If a wind turbine is struck by lightening then damages occur and you have to replace or repair the turbine for it to work properly. Wind turbines are noisy for people who live near them and sometimes disturb others' farms because all of the wind they are generating. Wind turbines used for wind energy are very useful but there are many downfalls to using them too. Wind turbines I think are very huge and ugly. You can see them from a mile away and there is not usually one of them every so often, there are many of them in an area. I think they ruin the landscape because you are putting the turbines in areas that is for nature. Once you set them up you scare away wildlife and they will not come back because of them and sometimes that wildlife can become an endangered species. Wind turbines are very loud and anything happens to them then they need to be replaced and it can be very expensive.]]>

It would take millions of tax payers money to make it happen, along with contributions from companies. Plus the wind is not blowing all hours of the day, so we would need to conserve our energy much more. This would also endanger much wildlife when we take away much of thier habitat and replace it with windmills, alsoputting migrating birds at risk. So with some advantages comes many disadvantages.]]>

A wind mill has as much as an effect as the wind on airplane wings. some advantages of having a wind mill is that it can generate enough energy for large numbers of people. It is said that in 2012, wind turbines in the United States generated about 3% of total U.S. electricity or the equivalent of about 12 million households. Having a wind mill is free making it easier for you not having to pay for electricity. With all of the new technology the cost of residential wind power pricing options have decreased over 60%. Many utilities around the country offer green pricing options that allow customers the choice to pay more for electricity that comes form renewable sources to support new technologies. There are also many disadvantages to having a windmill. Some people would say that the blades are really noisy and abnoxious. Some also say that they are too big, they have an ugly design, and that they ruin rural landscape. Windmills can endanger wildlife and migrating birds. Wind speed varies by 10% while turbine power varies by 25%. The win turbine can also cause lightning damage. Windmills are not for everyone.]]>

This eco-friendly way could be the main factor in pulling the United staes out of debt from other countries. Facts also show that up to 55% more energy would be produced from the windmills than using a central power source. This idea would also end power bills or at least lower them because of the eco-friendly windmills.]]>
