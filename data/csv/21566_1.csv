This classmate assumed that the dimensions where given in the same unit, and added 80yards+10 feet +10 feet, and 120 yards+ 10 feet+ 10 feet, and assumed that the answers where 100 and 140, respectively. In order to solve this problem, one will need to covert the units of distance in either feet or yards, in order to have the same units and be able to simply add them. If there are 3 feet in one yard, then you will need to multiply 80x3 to get 240, and multiply 120x3 to get 360. Now, we know that the dimensions of the soccer field are 240 feet by 360 feet. Additionally, there is a 10-foot-wide band around the soccer field. Now, you can add that distance to the dimension: 240feet+ 10 feet+ 10 feet=260 feet, And 360 feet +10 feet+ 10 feet=380 feet.

But you keep asking me all the questions and I have some questions for you this time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1) How was your day?</p> <p>A- Fantabulous</p> <p>B- Stupendous</p> <p>C-Rubbish</p> <p>D-Word</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now that were on an even battlefield we can start our conversation. Again. The question you asked me is to find a classmate's mistake on his or her homework and you know what? I don't believe in mistakes. What is a mistake anyways? But I do know what isn't a mistake. Going to the zoo is not a mistake I will tell you. I go to the zoo sometimes to see the animals. Their are ALL TYPES of animals at the zoo. Their are lions and zebra's, which I talked about in my previous paragraph, bears, and more important than the real animals their are stuffed animals. Im kinda hungry this morning. Last period I had math class. This question is also a math question. Now you can see how my answer all ties together.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Moving on from this dumb question I have a problem of my own that I need some help with. In the morning I like to eat cereal right pretty standard. But my go to cereal has been incredibly dissapointing lately in Captain Crunch (Crunch Berries Edition). Back in the day I used to Ride or Die to get me some crunch berries cha feel? But now when I look at that box as i bend it at a 62.395 degree angle to pour it in my cereal bowl with an 18.5 inch circumfrence and I don't even know who it is anymore. To be honest I don't even know who I am anymore. It's like if every morning you walked outside to look at the sun and take a deep breath of fresh air overlooking a beautiful prarie and then one day you step outside and you fall into a botomless abyth of death and special K cereal. Thats the pain I'm feeling right now. You may never understand me. But there's always gonna be another mountain. I'm always gonna want to make it move. Its always gonna be an up-hill battle. And sometimes I'm gonna have to lose. Ain't about how fast I get there. Aint about whats waiting on the other side. It's the CLIMB. I gotta be STRONG. And just keep on moving on! I like Miley Cyrus. She's pretty ;)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So ya thats been weighing me down lately. I see that this article thing to the left I'm supposed to read's title is&nbsp; Land of the Plenty. I like the movie Land Before Time. So dope.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I'm gonna be completely honest with you SBAC I can do better than this. You've seen my writing on the other two tests I'm just running out of steam. Let's be honest you probably framed and hand delivered it to the state and today I feel like all your gonna do is put a sticker on this and come shake my hand. Trust me I'm more dissapointed in myslelf than you are in me. I'm out here grindin you know just tryna make a dollar for ya'll and put the city on my back. Right now i've only got like a quarter and a couple city blocks on my back you know. Who am I kdding of course you know. Your grading the sbac for goodness sake. You know you stuntin.

No real knowledge, just meaningless numbers and equations that most students will never remember in there future lives. Standard Public Education needs a serious reboot in what &quot;education&quot; actually is nowadays. Kids require more in depth knowledge and intellectual training to real world matters and skills rather than the standard old school method of teaching mathematics, english, social studies and history, and science. Public Education needs to be practicalized to meet the needs of the New Age American. It seems as though the only purpose in modern education is to go to class, receive a grade, go home and do homework to receive a grade. There is no chance to better yourself intellectually and truly expand the mind.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that we learn to use our brains and think in school, but we are only conforming to the academics that the Board of Education feels is necessary for school students today to learn. Students should be taught how to perceive everyday lies we are told, false information that we are given in order for others to gain from our will to obey, we should be taught politics, and not politics in the sense of todays politicians who are only in search of the almighty dollar and keeping their position in office. There was a time when Americans had faith in the Government, when Americans believed that those who were in power were truly looking after them and for the better of America itself.</p> <p>After researching the Vietnam War for a history term paper, I read about the terrible war atrocities that occured. &quot;The first atrocity in modern warfare, is the murder of the truth.&quot; Now, my point is that we are lied to every single day, why is it that Europe has banned most of the ingredients in our food that we eat every day? Why is it that the FDA approves anti-depressants that cause depression and suicidal thoughts? Why are these medications layered with side effects that only cause more health issues? To sell more prescriptions, to make more money off of the ignorance of the standard American. But I digress, American society and politics have much room for improvement as does our educational system. Political leaders of the Board of Education make rules and regulations for public schools, as do they decide what is to be taught in these schools. Teachers do not become teachers so they can conform to some outdated and uneducated guess of a curriculum, they become teachers so they can see progression in each student, try to teach real knowledge and to teach/create an interesting and practical curriculum that makes students want to come back to school everyday. School has always been dreaded by the standard student who attends, but wouldn't it be truly a miracle if students enjoyed school? If teachers could teach what really needs to be taught?</p>",1683,1698,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,

So basically first you must remember how many feet are in a yard, which is....well....I don't know. But what I do know is that the width and length of the field are not just the 80 and the 120.</p> <p>For the 80, you must also&nbsp; take into account the ten feet that must also account to the width. I don't exactly know the measurements for 1 yard in feet, but I'm going to take a guess at three, since I'm pretty sure my yard stick has 36 inches, which is three feet. Keep in mind, I'm just taking a wild guess from my life experiences, well, actually, experience. I have this tri-fold ruler that I guessed about. Anyway, moving back to the problem.</p> <p>So you have 10 feet, and 80 yards. Which one is easier to convert? The yards, since going from feet to yards would amount into a horrible decimal. So, we take 80 yards and multiply it by 36 feet divided by one yard. This is dimentional analysis, something that can be helpful in math. Now 80 is 2880 feet, and adding ten to that makes it 2890 feet. That's our width.</p> <p>Now onto the length. All you have to do is multiply 120 by 36.

Mathematically and technically speaking, a foot and a yard are completely different forms of measurements. 1 foot is 1 foot, while 1 yard is 3 feet, it's a fact that we all learned in Elementary school in the 2nd grade. So if we meditate on this girls calculations, we find that by adding 80+10+10 to the width, she wasnt adding an extra 20 yards to the 80 yards, rather she was adding 20 feet. It's the same problem with the length. Her answer was 100 feet by 140 feet, which is incorrect. If we want our outcome to be in feet, then the first step that is needed is to convert the yards to feet.</p> <p>By doing this we have the outcome of the base field being:</p> <p><b>Width:</b> 240 feet <b>Length: </b>360 feet</p> <p>We have to keep in mind the 10 foot band around the field that is necessary, so now we have to add that in, so the calculations would be like this:</p> <p><b>Width: </b>240+10+10= 260 feet</p> <p><b>Length:</b> 360+10+10= 380 Feet</p> <p>Now if we want the answer in yards, all we need to do is divide the outcomes by 3.

Now I feel like I have ingested a bowling ball covered with Ipecac.<br> But this chick's mistake was first caring about the dimensions of a freaking soccer field.<br> You know, one time i went to a highschool soccer game. 45 minutes in I didn't even think it had started yet. True Story.<br> Anyway, This problem clearly takes an active engagement in critical thinking, because merely skimming once has not provided me with enough information to realize her mistake, Also i didn't scroll down, which probably also contributed to the problem.<br> You know what the biggest mistake is though?<br> Not seeing that abortion is against the constitution. We have the right to LIFE, liberty and the pursiut of happiness. Killing a fetus detsroys all of its potentional to have any of that. especially life. Case and point. So please bang responsibly.</p> <p>Too bad my boyfriend is a prick and thinks killing babies is perfecrly okay, because he would want me to kill the baby if i got pregnant.<br> &gt;:(<br> UNCOOL. At least put the baby up for adoption if it is really took much for you to handle and you really don't want it.<br> <b>How would you have likes to be aborted??</b><br> We argue about when it becomes &quot;Life&quot;. But flowers are alive, each cell is alive. That baby is alive the second it is concieved.<br> Now me and my lovely boyfriend are arguing abortion via this test.</p> <p>I am so anti abortion. Screw feminists who think it is their life and their body. While it is, it is also a childs body and life too. They are so ridiculously selfish. Its unreal.</p> <p>Now my boyfriend wouldn't let me read his argument, he deleted it. Silly boy. I wanted to read his self-serving fallacy.</p> <p>Anyway, abortion is so wrong. The only time it should be permissible is a rape baby, or if the child is going to die or kill the mother (not Chucky.. but you get the point) during birth or gestation. If there are serious risks. But if you are some stupid 16 year old girl or some selfish 30 year old, keep the kid, <b>or put it up for adoption.</b></p> <p>You had sex. You got pregnant. You were stupid. Live with the consequence, don't take the coward's way out. Its murder, even if you aren't going to prison. Life is life. People who don't see that piss me off. I am typically very very open to others' beliefs and see the validity behind them, but I cannot begin to fathom abortion. It is so wrong it makes me angry to the point of wanting to cry. Some people can't manage to think of anyone but themselves. D:&lt;</p> <p>Not saying we don't all have selfish moments, but I'm pretty sure the average human selfishness level does not extend to murdering an unborn child. That takes a special kind of narcicism. They should have been aborted (hypocritical statement to make a point).</p> <p>My boyfriend has brought up the point of children's sad sad sad sad lives in orphanage. Which depresses me greatly. The children speak of wishing they were aborted or could kill themselves. So. WE NEED TO FIX THE ORPHANAGES. and if people refuse to use condoms, we go and give them hysterectomies and vasectomies. Castrate the selfish bastards with rust spoons.<br> My goodness life pisses me off.&nbsp; I like America, and the fact that my boyfriend has traveled so much and seen so much devestation an poverty and depressed children whishing they were aborted or killed. Pure misery. Really shatters my dreadfully optimistic hope for life. It makes me angry and upset that not everyone can be so happy and eat so much for lunch they want to punture their stomach to relieve the pressure.

For the length; the same mistake was made. 120 yards should be multiplied by 3 to get 360 and then add 20 for the boundaries to get 380 feet.

Considering this though we have to infer that she is possibly european as the United States as a whole prefers to be a little bit of a rebel, and go with their own measuring system. Now you're probably thinking that yards is not part of the metric system, but in hindsight, Sindy is fully aware that it is not. But by the United States having their own measuring system rather than the standard metric system used WORLDWIDE. So she merely assumes that yards is equivalent of feet. Now there is a second scenario that could arise from this and that is that Sindy is merely uneducated, it's a scary thought to think that this girl is essentially laying the foundation for a huge project on school property, such as this soccer field, yet she does not know that yards is not equal to feet. This has many problems but two acute problems are prevalent, one being that we have to assume she is in at least middle school due to these genius math skills, and assuming she is in regular classes (considering she does not know the difference between yards and feet) it lies in fault with the teachers she has had that she does not know the difference. Now taking it into an even broader spectrum, if little Sindy is the one taking the measurements. we need to assume that she at the top of her class as she was given this pretty rare opportunity tomeasure a new plot of land. If she is at the top of the class we have to assume that everyone else is at a much lower standard than her, even though Sindy is already mixing up yards and feet. So ultimately the mistake does not lie with Sindy but rather than adult supervision that did not teach her well enough and teachers that were just passing her along giving her A's because she is mostly like cute and innocent. Another assumption that can be made is that this was slightly after the &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; movement by our dear friend, George H.W. Bush, who changed the way our public school system is ran, so maybe it is not the teacher at fault but rather the drastic and unconventional education reforms put forth by the Bush administration, why else would Nevada (ranked one of the lowest in education) be required to redo another &quot;proficiency&quot; test to make sure students are ready to hit the real world without us actually knowing how to deal with the real world. Students are not being taught fundamentals to live by, no job experience (aside from the slight chance you get &quot;Take your child to work day&quot; but majority hardly get that), no means of any professional know-how to pay the required taxes that ultimately end up going up to Reno anyways to finance their system.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So here's the corrected mistake by miss Sindy Boo-hoo since I am being told I have to start moving on (thanks for letting me take my time):</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Width: (80x3) + 10 = 250 ft (Now this is assuming that we plan to have a sidelines for spectators to fully enjoy the game and allow for a snack bar so that more income can be made.) 240 ft if you want to be a capitalist.
