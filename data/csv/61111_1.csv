It haches 7 days after it was layed. They have to dig their way out of the nest. They look around to see where they are. Most of them don't live. They get eaten by hungry preteters. If they live to be an adult they can get bigger. They have to eat and eat and eat until they fall asleep. Thats the time they grow. They grow in their sleep like humans do. If a turtle grows to much it will die. Its body can't grow forever. A sea turtle can't grow for ever. If a sea turtle could grow forever i would keep one as a pet.
