agreed with him.What about a sleepover at your house Duncan Will suggested.Sure what time do you guys wanna come over?7:00.Sure Billy said See you guys there.And they all disconnected.Everyone of the boys asked there mom if they could go they all approved.*Everyone is at Duncans house.Hey guys!Duncan exclaimed.Hi Duncan they all said simauentaneously(Same time at same speed)Wanna go in my Room or watch TV downstairs?Hmmm....They thought about it for about 1 minute.Lets go in your room.Duncan grinned&quot;Good choice Tom,Billy,and Will were amazed by the content in Duncans room.Posters of Famous Baseball Player signed officially by the superstars.He had a computer Ipod ,Iphone An Xbox 1,Wii,Gamecube,PS4,And A PSVITA.Will murmured I need to start coming over your house more often.They all burst out laughing.So what do you wanna play first.What kind of videob games do you have?No no Will i mean which console.?Oh will said what about the Xbox 1?Sure.What games do you have for it Billy said.Um let me see Duncan said ......I have Call of Duty Black Ops:2 Halo 4,And Sonic Allstar Racing transformed.Lets start with Call Of Duty Black Ops:2They played each game for at least 3 hours each.Luckily for them it was Friday which ment they would not get in trouble if they woke up extra late.They woke up about 12:00 midday on Saturday evening.Well I guess its time to go home see you later Duncan.Wait up guys I just gotta voicemail From the coach that the Baseball match is not going to be rescheduled for next week buts its actually going to be on today!What time!!!?They all asked.Um...1:00 Thats an hour from now I havent even brushed my teeth or eat my breakfast.Aww Maan I got a solution lets Bring A PBJ with us so that we can eat while the games going on.Wont that give us bad breath not if we bring mints.But...but...but The coach says that if your body is in motion after you eat your stomach will not digest the food good enough and you can choke/throwup.I dont care do you want to lose the championship or not.NOT they all said.Okay i just made a blueprint of how the plan will work after each hour of the game we will eat 1/4 of ours sandwhiches since every break 15 minutes that will give our stomachs enough time to digest the food into energy.Alright.We put on our clothes brushed our teeth combed our hair and made the sanwhiches it was time to put this plan into action.Lucky for them the Stadium had a 10 minute delay becasue they had to wash off dirt that had fallen onto the seats.Lets eat 1/8 of our sandwhich so because when you divide the time and fractions that should allow us to digest our food good enough.They cut small pieces of sandwhices of to eat.Unfortunately the coaches found out that they were eating the PBJS in the middle of a game.And he said it is not allowed to eat anything that has more than 100 calories for it would giver that teams players a energy advantage over the other.And they were banned from Baseball practice for about 3 days.Now Tom,Will,Duncan,And Billy were The MVPS of there team so without them the team could'nt win because each player could only scoare about 2 points before they were struck out those three could earn 10.In the game our opponent scraped us very harshly.***This is all your fault Will said when he came back to Duncans house that sunday.They all started to argue and blame and say mean things to each other.As it went on There freindship as a group disenegrated little by little.Until Dunca finally said maybe we shouldnt be freinds anymore.Will said &quot;Finally something we can agree on&quot;.As the anger and tension boiled in that room.Duncan punched Will in the stomach Billy chanted a battle cry.And then the rumble began............Everyone turned on each other instantly.It was madness.Duncans Mom came up into the room and screamed in A high raspy voice what is going on in here!Tom replied nothing were just having a little playfight Tom grinned.Thats alright but dont play in each so rough.Actually all of your mom are here nd there ready to pick you 3 up see you another time.Yeah See you guys another time.Billy murmured to himself im going to hit him in baseball practice.Now even though they were seperated they still wanted a good laugh.It was Duncans turn to hit and Billys turn to pitch everyone had made them go first in order to see this.Billy drew his handback.Builded up strength and threw.Duncan was expectinng that Billy was going to do this but what he didnt see was that the ball didnt come directly come towards him he was prepared for that with his bat in front of him.It instead did a corkscrew and curved at A Acute angle(A bent angle usually 30 degress or less).It hit him straight in his mouth.His mouth was bleeding red gushy water out and his blood grew hot.everyone laughed at him everyone was calling him A clown with red water from his face and a red face it was like he was a freakshow.Billy said Oops sorry about that just kidding.!Now Duncans anger grew so hot that it seemed as if he was 1 trillion degrees.He charged at Billy with destructive force and it landed him on the ground and he started to punch him in his chest furiously.",82,90,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,

All the kids from the baseball team shortly arrived at Will's house. All the kids asked,&quot; What is your idea!&quot; He finally said,&quot; You know how my mom knows coach very well?&quot; &quot;Yes, why?&quot; the kids from the team asked. &quot;We're driving to coach's house!&quot; &quot;Yay!&quot; Later that day the team went to the coach's house. They found out the hard way at school that when coach is taking a nap you DON'T wake him up. What do you know. When we got to his house we could see him throught the window and he was taking a nap! I was hoping he had some hope we were going to have the championships. Everyone on the team knew he had a &quot;secret&quot; crush on my mother so I bet some how she could charm him. We decided that my mom should wake him up. He finally woke up after about thirty minutes. He was very alarmed. &quot;Who are you? Why are you in my hou-&quot; coach screamed. &quot;It's me! Will's mother.&quot; my mother explained. &quot;Well, hello there!&quot; coach said. &quot;I was wondering if we could get the Championships back on?&quot; my mother grinned at me. &quot;Ummmm, well,&quot; We all were crossing our fingers. &quot;Anything for you. I mean why not!&quot; &quot;Thankyou sir!&quot; my mother said. We were all so excited that we all started jumping. Coach hadn't known we were in his house and well some of us broke a lot of stuff. He jumped as soon as he heard it. &quot;What was that?&quot; coach asked. &quot;What was what?&quot; my mother asked while she was totally saving us. &quot;Oh, maybe I was just hearing something. &quot;Probably.&quot; After that my mother rushed him out of bed. He told my mother to go away while he was changing. She was way ahead of him. He saw us and the glass broken everywhere. He was about to yell but my mother calmed him down. Soon we were at the game field. We called the other team and in about foruty five minutes they were there. We explained everything to them and they understood. They called all the fans that they have and soon enough everyone was here. At the end of the game I was pitching. I knew that right now everyone depended on me and so did the score. The score was tied 64-64. My group had a secret pitch that we made from the beginning of the tryouts. We make different hand signals for other ones but this was the one. I made the hand signal and the pitcher was terrified. I threw it and closed my eyes. I was crying on the inside. I didn't here a hit so when I opened my eyes I looked around. The other teams fans were not cheering. Neither were they. I thought to myself did I win the game? Then I looked at the pitcher. He caught the ball. It seemed as if my teams fans didn't start cheering until they knew that we had won. After the game my mom took me and my team out for hotdogs and fries. They were delicious! &quot;Thanks a lot mom!&quot; &quot;Your welcome.&quot; All my friends started going home and I went to bed and dreamed about the game over and over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
