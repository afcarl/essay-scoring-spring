TRAINING,H,N,N,F,4010141,5,10211683,<p>Julia is correct because when you are measuring it on the outside it is larger from with height and width. when you measure it from the inside the width and length shrink. When Julia meausured the outside perimeter she got 44ft. But when she meausures the inside perimeter it is 39ft. Also if you measure the outside perimeter first and then want to meausure the inside you just have to subtract each foot you got fom the outside by 1.</p>,54,226,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,

TRAINING,H,N,N,M,4014346,5,10211676,"<p>No, Julia is not correct because in the top right part it is 6ft but actually it is not, instead it is 7ft. One reason it is 7ft is because the bottom left part,which is 6ft,&nbsp; of the sandbox is much smaller than the upper right part. If she be measuring the inside perimeter of the sandbox diagram then it should be 6ft but because she is meauring the outside perimeter of the sandbox diagram, it is 7ft.</p>",226,140,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,
TRAINING,H,N,N,M,4014528,5,10211677,<p>I agree with Julie because a foot more outside will be a foot less inside. Also looking at the diagram at #2 you can see that that extra foot takes up the room in the inside.</p>,140,80,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,

By doing this you will come to a measurement of 48 ft. for the outside perimeter.

So to determine the perimeter of the shape we add up 12, 12, 8, 6 which equals 38 then subtract 2 times haw many numbers we added or four to get 34. Finally, add up 6 and 12-8 (the unlabled side) to get 10 thenn add it to the 34 we got earlier and that is the inside perimeter 44.

Why? because, in the inside of the sand box each part of the wall meets to form a corner but sence the two meeting parts of the wall conect to form a corner and/or angle there meeting at the same acses point whitch is one of the cubes that is one square foot. So basicly each corner meets at the same acses point and shares that acese point. So its amost like the inside perimeter has less squares then the out side perimater because the insides almost cutting corners or makeing each wall meet point share a corner, So therefor the inside perimeter has less has less squre feet because parts of walls are sharing corners, but on the outside each wall has its own corner and instead of counting all the way around like you would with the inside perimeter (35 feet) you would have to jump to the next wall, because the outside perimeter walls (47 feet) don't share corner points like the inside perimeter does!</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
