Then you should add 75 sandwiches + 15 sandwiches then you get 90 sandwiches in total that was the mistake that John made.Anther reason that John is incorrect because he probably added 40+35=75 sandwiches then he maybe added a 5 instead of a 15. That is how I know that John is incorrect. In conclusion that is how I know that 40 sandwiches + 35 sandwiches + 15 sandwiches = 90 sandwiches.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
