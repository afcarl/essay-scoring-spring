Whatever way they transported the heavy blocks needed imagination, so the Aztecs were really creative, which was a factor that determined that Tenochtitlan was a highly developed city. The second example in Source #1 states that even though only having simple tools to construct buildings, the Aztecs built magnificent temples with beautiful carvings to honor and worship the gods they believed in. They also honored the nobles and priests by building bigger and nicer houses than the ones ordinary people lived in, which were in the outskirts Tenochtitlan, far from the beautiful courtyard and temples. Despite only having simple tools to build their city, the Aztecs found a way to build extraordinary temples without using cranes and advanced tools like what we have today.
