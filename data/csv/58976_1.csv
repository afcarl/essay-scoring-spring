One big issue is the fact that the wind isn't always going one 24/7 to actually turn the blades to create the energy. If we are to use this type of renewable energy than we shouldn't need to always worry when the wind isn't blowing anymore so than no more power for the people in that region. Another big factor is since the wind doesn't blow all the time how are we going to get the most energy out of it when the wind does come around? The only way I see it is we are going to have to build a large number of them all over the place which will just create less space for humans to use and it can also take away land animals in the areas live in.

I concede that most birds are smart enough to stay away from big noisy fans, but there are birds that aren't as smart and they can get killed if they get sucked into the blades. Lightning is also a concern, they build some of the windmills out of metal and if the turbines are creating electricity then lightning is more likely to strike at them.

These obstructions dont need the wind energy to make it a diffrence in the forest the climax is refreshing and there are many trees which gives us clean oxygen to breathe . On top of these huge mountains wind energy isnt needed because it is a cold area covered in snow , humans wont live there, and by adding more wind to it , it makes the weather more intence. Buildings dont necessarly need any type of wind power , its just useful and helpful to us such as living under a roof top , jobs , clinics , schools etc. If it gets hot during some point of the day then we turn on the air conditioner to make it cool. Yes opening the windows would be a great idea that you can do but the feeling of the cold a.c blowing is satisfying . Working in Man-made structures is a tuff job beacuse you get tired easily and you realese so much energy in one day.

Your hours of hours outside but because your a certain level above the ground when the wind blows you feel it more than if you were to be on the ground.

TRAINING,W,N,N,F,4382111,11,10197150,"Though wind turbines are thought of as an incredible new source of energy, there are many downsides. Wind turbines are believed to have minimal environmental impact because they don't produce waste, don't create pollution or radioactive waste, and they don't consume non-renewable resources like coal or oil. Even though they are believed to have no negative environmental effects, this is simply not true. The blades on wind turbines are incredibly noisy, and create large amounts of noise pollution. This noise pollution disrupts the surrounding environment and can cause wildlife to migrate away from the area. This noise pollution disrupts the balance in the ecosystem. Besides causing animals to move away from the area, wind turbines can also endanger the wildlife directly. Often times birds will be flying and be struck by the enormous blades. The blades cause a real danger to migrating birds and can kill them in large amounts. The noise pollution created by wind turbines, and the danger they pose to wildlife are two ways that wind turbines are not as useful of an energy source as people believe. Besides being a danger to the surrounding ecosystems and wildlife, wind turbine farms ruin rural landscapes. Wind farms must be placed in open, unindustrialized areas to catch the most wind and be the most productive. This means that wind farms need to be placed in rural landscapes. In placing wind turbines in these areas, we ruin the beauty of the surrounding nature. Turbines are large and ugly in design and cause an eye sore where there could be extreme natural beauty. The last issue that wind turbines pose is that they are not as resourseful as people believe. Wind does not constantly blow, and thus wind turbines are often not generating any energy at all. Even when the wind is blowing, the windspeed can vary by 10%. This can cause the wind turbine power to vary by 25% which does not make it a stable energy source for the entire population, or any population. Wind turbines are limited in where you can place them as well. The area can not be obstructed by any large buildings, man-made structures, forests, or mountains. This means we are very limited in where we can place these wind farms. Over all, wind turbines are more trouble than they are worth, they harm the environment through means other than pollution and waste, and they are not a reliable source of energy.",211,803,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,

The principal argument negating the benefits of this new source of energy is the limited efficiency of the turbines themselves. Wind energy, of course, requires wind, without which turbines cannot generate energy; however, there is no location where the wind blows all day, everyday, thus producing energy 24/7, the first of many issues negatively affecting energy output. Furthermore, maximum efficiency would be reached where there are little or no wind obstructions - for example, forests, mountains, and man-made structures - but there are few such ideal spots, thus decreasing efficiency again. Even in chronically windy locations, wind speed varies by 10%, which equates to a 25% variation in turbine power. When taking the extremely limited efficiency of wind turbines into account with production costs, even advocates must acknowledge the foolishness of attempting this venture on a grand scale. There are, no doubt, a few locations ideal for wind turbines, but by definition they must be located somewhere distant from urban developments or civilization, in remote regions with not only no man-made structures, but no obstructing, naturally-ocurring geographic obstructions as well. This immediately increases production and development costs, which can be compounded with the cost of maintainence. The turbines must be continuously replaced or repaired due to damage inflicted by nature, especially lightning. Thus the output, energy, is not worth the input, money and resources. Efficiency aside, these turbines have a significant impact on the environment as well. Although the most appealing benefit of wind energy is its supposedly low impact on the Earth, this belief is ill-founded. Although there may be a limited carbon footprint, in its stead, there is a significant ecosystem impact; the turbines, placed in remote locations with plentiful wildlife, endanger wildlife, especially migrating birds. This is worrisome because of the already diminishing wildlife diversity because of humans' impact. Furthermore, they create significant noise pollution, and unnecessarily blemish what remaining testiments exist of Earth's former glory.

Windmills have grown as a powerful source due to the fact that they do not generate pollution or radioactive wastes, they do not consume any of the non-renewable resources such as coal, oil or natural gas. Wind mills are also very effective when it comes to hurricanes, power outages or brown outs because they continuously give off energy. It is however a proven statement that is 2012 wind turbines in the United States generated almost about 3% of electricity and was equivalent to a total of 12 million houses. If larger turbines were ever connected to an electrical grid, it would give the people the benifit of wind power without having to own their own system. Overall, windmills are a postive outcome to our society and continue to create great things and help people.",211,179,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,

There isn't any natural source of continuous wind, so what happens when the wind goes away? When the wind mill blades aren't turning, energy is not being generated for domestic use. Wind mills are big and tall things, since they have to be high up to catch stronger winds. This could potentially be a threat to the lives of endangered wildlife such as certain types of migrating birds, and any other birds for that matter. Birds are animals who have had migrating formations and routes that have been used for hundreds of years, and they are acccustomed to follow them year after year. So what if wind mills were to be built just in time for migratinig season, birds could be hit by the swinging blades od the mill and get injured or die. Endangered species of birds could also be victims and their injury or death from possibly being hit by wind mill blades which could then lead to a decline in their already at risk speices.",469,179,254,,,1,2,2,,,,,,,
TRAINING,W,N,N,F,4376429,11,10197157,"Wind energy, while a relatively eco-friendly and convenient source of power, has several important flaws. The turbines that generate wind energy rely, obviously, on wind, and because wind does not blow constantly, the turbines cannot generate energy reliably. This is similar to the effect of solar panels, which can only generate energy during the day. Wind speed and turbine power vary as well, by 10% and 25%, respectively. Furthemore, wind can be obstructed by forests, mountains, buildings, and other man-made structures, exacerbating the unreliability of wind and therefore wind energy. Turbines have a high likelihood of being struck by lightning, due to their height and metallic composition, creating damage and costly repairs. Turbines are also rather large machines, and since they are often placed in remote or rural areas, their noisy blades and incongruity with a natural setting can ruin a landscape. Though wind energy is often hailed as a &quot;green&quot; and non-polluting source of energy, turbines' spinning blades are a danger to migrating birds and their placement in a natural habitat may be detrimental to endangered species living in the area. They can also be unpleasant for any humans living nearby, as turbines create significant noise pollution and groups of them in wind farms can create the volume of a small jet engine.

However, humans cannot create their own wind- sure, they can place windmills on areas exposed to more wind, such as the top of a hill, but it will not ensure that energy can be created 24/7. This is quite ineffective, as a lot of energy must be required to keep a household running. If no wind is present, there is nothing to be done, and the windmill is rendered useless. In addition, the blades are extremely noisy, adding on to the fact that noise pollution will be added to the already polluted Earth. To anyone living near windmills, they will have hours of noisy windmills outside their houses. Peace and quiet will be disturbed and it will be hard to continue to live in the area. Morever, wildlife will also be affected by the windmills becuase of their wide surface areas and ability to seriously injure any animals.This must be prevented as animals cannot tell what kind of trouble they will find themselves in. Protecting wildife is always something to keep in mind, as humans have already destroyed thousands of animal habitats with existing windmills.

These turbines can also be prone to environmental disasters such as lightning, earthquakes and tornadoes. The wildlife in areas of windmills can be harmed significantly. Animals that get too close to these windmills, primarily birds, can be absolutely shredded and killed by these blades. The noise that windmills generate can also disrupt the lives of animals and prove to be harmul to their health. The inconsistencies that these windmills have can also prove to be a major problem. With wind speed varying by 10% (a very significant variable), the amount of energy produced can prove to be insufficient at times, especially when supplying a heavily populated city. Coupled with the varying turbine power (25%), this can be a very risky proposition, especially for densily populated cities.

The wind energy can also create a surprising amount of damage to the environment, contradictory to a piece of the glamour of alternative energy. Wind energy is a hassle for a society to accept into its life due to its many shortcomings and distractions it provides for society.

In many climates there is a lack of wind flow, making the alternative energy of wind power virtually useless there. Along with the lack of function when wind fails to blow, there is a variance in the wind speed in an area, leading to a variance in the amount of power that can be provided to a society attempting to function with wind power. The wind power can also fail to function if the turbine suffers from lightning damage, requiring a repair to occur lest the society wish for less power. Wind power also suffers from the problem of having a far-reaching negative effect on the environment around.

Because windmills are often built on the country side than urban areas due to their large amount of required land, they have the possibility to mess up a usable, fine land. Building windmills can also interfere with the migration of the birds. They block the birds way when they're moving from places to places and might even injure them in a way. With the chance of killing an endangered wildlife, one should consider of its use.

Places, such as shore lines and tops of hills are the most efficient places to build windmills because wind speeds are always higher on greater altitides, but, when spaces become limited, they will be placed closer to sea level, causing less generation of wind and problems in communities or commercial areas. Turbine power varies by 25% instead of 10%. When placing windmills in more areas common to the public, it may disrupt its surrounding.

One of the largest issues caused by using wind energy is the amount of space they take up and the problems this causes. Several hundred wind turbines are needed in order to create a suitable amount of energy, and because of the noise pollution they produce they are constructed in less populated areas. The disadvantage of this is that they take up space that was once occupied by wildlife, and their constructed causes a disruption in the local ecosystem. Along with this, the flight patterns of birds might cross the wind turbines, and the giant blades are deadly for anything flying through. One of the other serious disadvantages is the fact that wind is not a reliable source of energy. It fluctautes, and this unrealiability causes the energy produced by the wind turbines to be as such; unreliable. Even in places where is is commonly windly, the amount of wind is not gauranteed and energy is something that is always in demand in large amounts, so if the demand is not able to be met then problem occur. The final disadvantage of wind energy is obvious: the amount of money and resources it takes to make one wind turbine is large, yet even with the amount we have right now, they only generate about 3% of the U.S.'s total energy. Imagine how many it would take in order to get that number to a significant amount, especially considering the cost of producing just one.

If you pay attention to turbine blades around your area, you might notice that the blades are not always blowing like they are supposed to be to make power. Some actually spin the normal speed, but makes a terrible screeching sound of a giant needle scratching a glass. This disturbs the wonders of nature and can damage people's hearing if they live nearby these machines. Turbines that don't move or hardly move are not worth it because wind speed varies by 10 percent while turbine power varies by 25 percent. What's the point of having big ugly turbines that ruins the view of rural landscapes if they hardly make any energy for us at all. It's true, they make energy without causing global warming, but the cost of that little energy is not worth the disturbance they cause in nature and rural communities. As mentioned before, turbines can really destroy the environment around them. In order to build turbines, forests must be cut down and mountains must be manipulated to actually build man-made objects on top of it. Not only does it ruin the nice rural landscape, it also forces animals to move out because they want to avoid the ugly sound it causes. Turbines also suffer from lightning damage, so when that occurs, anything around it can be badly hurt and the turbine is just left there to rot. Animals who commonly get reallly hurt by turbines are birds. Unfortunately, migrating birds are beat down by spinning turbines and most of the time, they don't survive this.

Noisy blades can also be a problem because it disturbes the homes of who surround it which can create a malestrom of conflict. Birds migrate every year and if turbines block the passage of which the bird migrates it may hurt the birds which pass through them.

However, although wind energy becomes more and more important for a green society, there are some disadvantages of wind energy we must consider before we use it in our daily life. First of all, wind--especially high-speed wind--does not exist everywhere. Wind is only abundant in certain areas such as shoreline, the top of a hill, or an open empty space. High-speed wind rarely exists in densely-populated areas such as the cities and suburbs. That being said, wind energy must be first transported hundreds of miles to our homes before we use it. Therefore, a certain amount of energy will be wasted during the process of transportation. Similarly, wind does not always blow continuously at the same speed. If wind energy is not sufficient enough to provide energy at any hour of the day, then it would be a hugh issue when people are in a desparate need of electricity. On the other hand, wind energy is not 100% eco-friendly. The size of those turbines that are used to generate wind energy is enormous. The momentum of the turbines can kill hundreds of birds that accidentally fly through.

These windmills are designed to save energy, reduce pollution, and allow areas to generate energy strictly from just wind fource. Alothough, windmills are a way for the enviorment to not only save energy and reduce the use of harmfull wastes, such as, coal, natural gasses and oil, however, there are negative side effects to the construction of windmills and the affects afterward, also in a fast developing society, windmills may not be officent to all parts of the country. When wind farms are made, it requiers large areas of land for construction, which leads to furthure consequences due to the construction of these large fans. When large areas of land are reserved for wind farms, wild life that used to use that land for a source of shelter are now required to finds a new source of shelter. This can cause some animals to become endangered, due to their lack of shelter. However, it is not only the animals living on the land, it is the birds in the scy that are also being affected. The windmills are disrupting their migration paternes, which can cause bird to go endangered or native birds to flee away from their native areas, causing affects to other regions. The constructiobn will cause land loss and large amounts of trees to be cute down due to construction. This again will causing a negative effects to the wild life that live under the trees and within the trees, causing animals to become endangered. The large amount of land for construction of the windmills is more of a negative effect to the land and wild life than a positive effect. With cites constantly expanding and advancing, windmills will not fit in, or keep up with the standors of a developing society. These windmill farms cause excessive amounts of noise that cites aready produce. Also cities are expanding at rapid rates, so the land that is left needs to be preserved for wild life and viewing perpouses. Furthure generations should have the ability to view open lands without seeing large wind farms. The terbins disrupt the natural beauty of nature due to their ugly structors and loud noises.

They're large structures that require excessive space. Wind power is also unreliable, as the speed and direction the wind blows is unpredictable. These are only two examples and they're just scratching the surface! Windmills used to produce wind energy are poorly engineered and unconventional. Weather-wind especially- is an unpredictable thing. The speed of the wind significantly varies the speed in which the turbine's blades rotate, altering the amount of energy able to be produced. Even more problematic is the case of no wind at all-no power! Sometimes, during heavy storms, a turbine may be struck by lightening, cause damage to the machine. Wind turbines need to be erected in large grids to produce a profitable amount of energy, meaning they consume quite a bit of land. Windmills require land without any obstructions(often natural, preserved land) to achieve maximum exposure to wind. Ironically, the large, unsightly turbines become an obstruction themselves. They taint rural landscapes with their industrial and out-of-place structures.Wind power also isn't as innocent as it's often portrayed.

First off, wind energy poses a great threat to many bird populations and even some endangered species in those areas. The farms take up a lot of space and in some cases even destroy natural habitats for these animals. Just like hydroelectric power it is killing thousands of species in order to get electricity. Lastly, the wind turbines are extremely loud and cause a lot of noise pollution which also causes animals to leave the area. The constant droning noise that disturbs the sleeping patterns and circadian rhythm of animals. These disturbances can cause delayed birth, unusual behaviors, and even different eating habits.

Does it really stand as a beneficial source, or just a way for people to spend more money? No doubt, energy soucre does no good for the people. It has noisy blades, it effects the endangered wildlife,and can cause turbine lightning damage. First, wind energy has noisy blades. It has big blades on it and they move in a circualr motion, which causes noises, and those noises can be irritating. Especially if you live in a close vecinity of one, itll bother you when your trying to sleep, or even when your just having quiet time. Who wants somethig like that near them? Second, the wind energy effects the endangered wildlife. Those endangered species are already dying off so why would you create an obstruction near them that could affect their population even more? The wind enegry especailly affects the migrating birds, since the blade are high up in the sky, sometimes the birds could fly into one of them and die. Which also will decrease the bird popualtion in that area. The existence of those endagered species is more important than creating more energy from wind mills, when there are many other ways energy could be created. Lastly,the wind energy can cause turbine lightining damage. Since the wind mills are so high up in the sky, when lightining occurs those would most likely be the first targets to be hit. This will cause damage to not only the wind mill, but to any thing or person near it. Unfortunately, also causing the town further money to be paid. This isn't good because if it was a small town who invested in this wind mill, half their money was spent towards that. So what happens to the expenses of the damgae done. In conclusion, all these factors point to valid reasons why wind mills shouldnt be invested in. They have noisy blades, it affects the endangered wildlife,and can cause turbine lightining damage.

Windmills also are very dependent on the wind, if it is a windy day, then there is less energy to be gathered, which then means going back to nonrenewable sources such as coal and natural gas, all in all, this makes it far too expensive to be practical on a large scale, hydroelectric is a much better solution, energy can be stored and released as needed, plus the dams provide flood control, and also provide drinking water and recreation in the summer in the forms of the lakes they create.",579,241,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,

The only problem with this article is that it only told you the good parts of it. There are probably thousands upon thousands of different reasons why the windmills are bad. I think that one of the bad points would be how much space the windmills take up. The windmills are huge and completely taking up more room on farmers land. The windmills are just going to keep coming and there are going to be more and more of them. The only problem is if they take up so much space where are we going to star putting them? Are we going to put them in fields? Mountains? If we keep bringing more and more windmills into our lives maybe the less space we have for ourselves. In conclusion I think that the windmills are a bad idea. I bet in the near future if the world keeps bringing the windmills up that they will just be everywhere.

These include that the wind is not blowing all the time, damage to the turbines because of lightning and other natural occurances, and that it is a bad thing for the wildlife. Although the wind blows frequently, it is not an everyday occurance. Especially in the summer months the wind blows less frequently and it doesn't blow hard enough to create enough energy for the turbines to work effectivly. This would cause power shortages or outages to the facitulies that used the energy created by the turbines. As much as the government would like to use these, the more problems they would be faced with. Another issue that wind turbines would create is damage during large storms. When the wind blows and lightning begins to strike, damage takes place. These turbines would be in the perfect location for lightning to strike them. In large open fields with even larger metal objects. There would be more money spent in replacing these items then not. And lastly, the enviroment would take a toll because of these turbines.

Chopping down that tree will destroy an animals home and leave it out in the cold.With the destruction of their homes, more animals are now found dead on nearby highways.

The answer to this question may surprise many as there are several lesser known factors that make wind energy more of a liability than an asset for the world many wish for it to support. Fisrt of all, these wind turbines are detremental to bird population.

When added to the danger of lightning damage, and the difficulties of finding an unemcumbered area large enough for an amount of turbines to generate any worthwhile amount of energy, it becomes evident that wind energy is more trouble than it's worth.

Wind may not blow 24/7. There will be times when the wind will not be able to blow. If there is no wind, then there is no power. Also, the wind speed varies between each day. The wind speed varies by 10%, which causes turbine power to vary by 25%. So one day the wind will be blowing very hard and fast, but the next day, the wind may not blow that hard. That means that one day, a town may have an abundance of electricity, but the next day, they may not have enough to power everything that reqiures electricity. Next, wind turbines have noisy blades that can cause noise pollution if there is enough of them. In fact, wind farms generate enough noise equivalent to a small jet engine. That will make it harder for residents to perform activities that require a quite setting. Lastly, wind turbines can be a danger to the enviroment. The turbines are too big, they have an ugly design, and they ruin rural landscape. Since the wind is more powerful at greater heights, the wind turbines need to be tall to recieve as much wind power as possible. Because of this, animals such as birds are risk of rinning into the turbine blades and dying. Also, the turbines can act as a lightning rod during thunder storms.

Another issue concerning their size is the danger they present to the migration paths of certain animals. The large amount of space the blades take up and the speeds at which they turn can kill any bird or animal that comes in contact with the blades. Apart from the issues witht the generators, the turbines can also be very inffevtive. They do not run 24/7 which cuts the amount of energy they can produce.

Overall, wind turbines cause more issues than good they contribute to clean energy production. The ineffectiveness and uselessness of wind turbines outweighs their movement for the use of clean energy. The large wind turbine farms do produce energy but they do not produce the maximum they can.

Wind speeds vary by 10% which translates to a more serious 25% difference in power from the turbine.Turbine blades have been described as being shaped like an airplane's wings causing them to spin quickly. However no where was it mentioned that this fast spinning also creates sustantial noise pollution, equivalent to a small jet engine. It has been mentioned that a wind turbine is especialy effective when a hurricane wipes out other sources of power. However a hurricane would also destroy a wind turbine as it draws lightning to itself and causes expensive damage. If one moves away from problems caused to humans, then one finds a large danger to the animal population.Migrating birds are unable to distinguish fast moving turbine blades from ordinary sky, and ususpectinly fly directly into turbines.

Not only would the wind not blow enough, but in some places, where there may or may not be an adequate amount of wind, a windmill may not be able to be set up there. The first obstacle would be moving the huge blades and stand to the location it needs to be set up. In mountainous areas, having huge semis carrying huge blades down sloping roads is not a good idea.
