She, along with her three older brothers, worked on the Fallower family farm in their childhood. They had a heck of a time , always getting through the hard work with the love and support they and their parents had for one another. Everyone in the family surprisingly got along. No one did anything unusual or different. &quot;We were like peas and carrots&quot; Ida once said in an interview for the Nevabea Times. Though the good times didn't last forever...</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ida enjoyed the farm life, though she found it quite predictable and boring. Occasionally every few months or so they would get deliveries from the factories in Nevebea, the big city in Guinea Pig County, but that was all the excitement she ever felt inside herself in those days.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Ida turned sixteen years old, she told her family she had an announcement to make.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I love all of you, and I love living with you guys. However, I cannot stay on the farm forever.&quot; The Fallower family, which was eating supper at sunset like any ordinary, turned their heads from their meal at once, as if they were controlled with strings by a puppeteer.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the shock of change went away from the five, Ida explained how even though the Fallower family had been living on that farm for generations, she just couldn't take the idea of living their forever. She wanted to move to the big city, Nevebea. While she would still miss them, she would be able to visit them on holidays since, afterall, she was still within the boundry lines of Guinea Pig County.&nbsp; Her parents refused to accept her reasonable ideas and sent her to her room, using the same punishments that all the Fallower's endured when they did something &quot;bad&quot; for generations. However, it didn't work on Ida. She used her brain, thought for herself, and used a rope to sneak out from her second story window. It was last the Fallower's saw her until Ida's wedding day.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; While in Nevebea, Ida was determined to succeed on her own through lower, menial jobs as she worked her way through the ranks. Eventually she was able to become a newscaster for the Channel</p> <p>69 News. She also found love, got married, changed her name to Ida Individual, and lived happily ever after.

Once apon a time there was a magical panda who live in africa, i know what youre all wondering, Why the f**k is a panda living in africa? Well... let me tell you why, this is a heart breaking story of how Roger the panda grew up, it all started when he was 2 he lived in a japanese village with his mother and father. They were not the most fortunate animals, but they were happy because they had enough to eat. in the morning they ate bamboo and rice, in the afternoon they played hide and seek, and at night they slept in their bamboo houses. the three of them lived peacefully along side each other, but everything changed when the fire nation attacked. a group of rinocerous invaded his village and they slaughtered all the pandas, they forced them to dig holes in the ground and when the holes were deep enough they were shot then burried alive. Luckily for Roger he was able to escape the massacre because a bamboo named bachief carried him out of the village and they took refuge in a abandoned super market. they stayed there for about 4 months until they were rescued by some spartans. they were taken to the city of athens. as rojer grew up bachief became a father figure to him and they had a sacred bond. at the age of 12 he was sent to boot camp to join the marines. in boot camp he met a man named daniel and they were constantly picked on by the other recruits. one day he saw daniel getting beat up behind a barrack so Roger slit thier throats and ate them. after that day they were brother in arms. upon graduating from boot camp he found out bachiefs cancer had reached his heart and he had 1 day left. they cried and Roger carried bachief to the abandoned supermarket as bachief did to him 10 years ago. they said thier goodbyes and then bachief said the last words which started Rojers journey to manhood. He wispered in a very weak voice &quot;tell my family im sorry&quot; with that he handed him a map with a location marked on it. And so Rojer started his journey. He went to the first stop on the map in the city of london. While in the city he went to a cafe. he asked for directions to his location and a man in an over coat overheard him. when he left the cofee shop he was attacked by a group of masked men. they kidnapped him and took him to a abandoned hotel and tortured him. when hey were about to kill him they were all shot from behind. daniel had came just in time to save him. they were at last reunited. They found a guy who was still alive and interrogated him. at first they couldnt get any info but after some torturing theu were able to find out he was sent by the firenation to assassinate him. they then continued the journey since there was nothing they could do about it. 2 days later they had to cross a bridge over the lake of fire. the cord on the brige snapped and daniel fell. Roger was able to catch him and they were hanging on for their lives. daniels leg was burned off and he told Rojer to let go of him and save himself. roger yelled no because daniel never let him down and he promised to be there with him forever. they then both fell and died together. moral of the story youll never find out what happened.&nbsp;</p>",2694,3053,,,,,,,,,I,I,,,

TRAINING,W,N,N,M,2114087,11,10240648,"<p>So. The newscaster is a brain. After some pretty in-depth research, I was blessed to come to the conclusion that if they giant pot o' coffee did spill out, it would cover approximately 840.1596303311 square feet, or, 840.16 square feet, or, 840.2 square feet. Obviously the caster is wrong, and really should not have the current job that she has, because she is giving off fake information, which is a reason why the entire news scene today seems a tad fishy. Also, <b>#greenwall</b> did a surprisingly good job at COD Champs a few weeks ago. No one really expected them to even get top 8, let alone third place in the entire tournament. I also think that everyone who says that MBoze is going to get dropped is delusional. There would be no reason for OpTic to drop someone who got them top 3, and $120,000. The only player that I would ever want to replace $B is Ricky, and that's because I've been a huge Ricky fan for quite some time now. They way that he meshes with NaDe and MBoze is amazing, and I'm sure that if they were to drop any player, and pick up another, it wold be Ricky no doubt. The one thing that I am a bit worried about is the fact that Ricky isn't on a team right now. Being a great vocal leader, and a great teammate (Matt even said that Ricky was his favorite teammate) he should have no problem finding a team. A lot of people are speculating that he is going to end up going to SB with John, Spacley, and either Methodz, or Fears, and i think that either of these teams will be great. Another new team to look out for is Curse AU, which is really just the Trident T1 Dotters, who got 5th at COD champs. I think that its great for the dotters because now they are under an official, and extremely professional organizations with Blevdog. I'm also hoping that JustUs is going to work out well with Neslo, K1LLA, Mirx, and Stainville, because I've always liked the K1LLA and Mirx duo. Finally, even though people aren't really thinking too much about Curse LV, or ATL, i think that it's going to be a great team. Led by Haggy, he has a great AR in Mochila, an ex-halo pro in enable, and a seasoned veteran in Tipsy. Overall, I am predicting that there are going to be quite a few upsets in the upcoming tournaments.</p>",2694,2465,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,

TRAINING,W,N,N,M,2221487,11,10240679,"<p>The newscaster is incorrect on her claim. The area that the spilled coffee would cover would be around 696969 blocks in the city that they live in. How do I know this, you might ask? Well, I can tell you that answer as briefly as possible. First, I overheard Bryce and Karissa talking about how they know the exact amount of blocks that the spilled coffee would cover if the coffee fountain cup were to ever spill. I heard them start talking about how it covered 696969 blocks, but Bryce disagreed with Karissa, for he said it was reverse cowboy, and then I thought, that does not even make any sense! I wasn't watching them, but I heard them making strange noises with each other and a random fapping sound became quite loud and the next thing I know, Karissa starts making these even weirder sounds. They started talking about how something broke and then Karissa starts hitting Bryce and crying. I have no clue what is going on at this point, because I just cared about how much blocks the spilled coffee would cover. So I decided to keep listening to them in case they brought up the actual answer of the amount of blocks that the spilled coffee would cover. Karissa started crying and saying that she wishes that Bryce never spilled his coffee, whatever that means. I guess she felt upset, for ever since we were friends in 2nd grade, they always had there friendly moments, friendlier than me and Bryce or me and Karissa ever got to be. They had, what they called &quot;tickle time&quot; and they always giggled in Bryce's closet, especially when we slept over his house, which was like all the time. There came a point in our friendship when we all started to go through puberty, and that was when things became real weird dude. We all started to hang out with each other less and less, until Karissa grew a nice rack, then Bryce seemed to become really interested again, even though he told me he would never tell me the real reason why. I always became suspicious from that point on, and then, I figured it all out! It had finally made sense to me that, they were cousins! Even though they never wanted to talk about how they were cousins, they always said that they loved each other and no matter what, they would always see each other every day for the rest of their lives. I do not know why, but they always kissed each other good bye when they left each other to go to their separate houses, but they never kissed me goodbye. I would have really liked to get a lil smooch from Karissa, but whenever I told Bryce about tit, he always punched me in the face amd then told me I am a strong little boy. But that was in 7th grade, so I did not know what he was talking about. Now that I think about tit, I remember this one time where we were roughing around and he pulled out this white cloth and put it on my nose and mouth, and he literally knocked me out! I did not know that white cloth can do that to someone, but all I can remember was how sore I was when I woke up. Man, was I sore! I couldn't go to the bathroom for a whole 2 weeks! I guess white cloth is able to make your bowels freeze up and everything in that area becomes sore, so he has told me before. I always thought he had used it on Karissa, because every time they were done with tickle time, she always felt sore and sometimes could not even walk from being so sore! He told me he used a blue cloth, which does the same thing except for knocking someone out from the cloth, which is the difference between the white cloth and the blue cloth. So, I guess it would be wise to get back to the whole reason why I am giving you an answer. To answer your question, that newscaster lady was 100 percent incorrect about her statement! How might I know this, you may ask? Well, I would be more than happy to tell you right now! So me and the newscaster lady, Sharkisha, we used to date a lil while back. We got into an argument about how the color of the sky is blue or it its sky color. I said it was blue, and she said it was a sky color. She did not understand what blue meant, so I put the blue cloth to her face, but it did not work for me for some odd reason. All it did was just cover her face, and I was hoping it would cause her to get sore and make her crawl away or something. She was completely baffled by what I did, so she beat me and then she made weird noises, the very same as Bryce and Karissa! Without using a cloth, she made me so sore that it was almost an identical feeling to the same situation as when me and Bryce got into that fight, the one I told you about a lil while back in the story. So, Sharkisha told me to promise her that I would not fight with her again, so from then on, I always told her that the color of the sky is sky color, and then she kissed me and took out her pocket and told me to grab on to it whenever we went out in public, which did not really make sense to me, but it sure did make me feel purdy good! So I bet as you are reading this, you are thinking, how did me and Sharkisha end up breaking up? We do not like to talk about it with other people because it makes the both of us really uncomfortable, so I will try to be as breif and short with the story as possible. So it all began on a sunny day and I woke up from a crazy night that was equivalent to 69 white cloths! I was super sore and I could barely move, and when I tried to sit myself up I could not believe what I saw in front of me. Do you want to know what it was? I think you do want to know what it was, so I guess I will tell you right now. I saw Sharkisha with another man! This one was not even close to how I was, and I am pretty sure that this was no man, but a half woman! Half women kind of look like manbearpigs, so I tried to pack my things and move out as quick as possible before the manbearpig saw me and ate me! I was so lucky to be out alive and unharmed, but I still had a quest to follow, and that quest was to find out how many blocks that spilled coffee covered, and before I left Sharkishas shack, I overheard her saying that for her new job(newscaster job) she was going to lie to the whole world on national television and say that the spilled coffee would cover how ever many blocks she thought it would cover, even though she said that she knew that the correct answer is 696969, so I panicked and told my boss. My boss, Hank, told me that he would fire me if I ever questioned a newscaster ever again, so I promised him that I would not do that ever again, or so he thought! HA! It turns out that I was just lying to him, because I knew in my heart that the entire world needed to know the truth to how many blocks that spilled coffee cup would cover, which was 696969. So as Sharkisha found out that I told everyone, she tried to have tickle time with me! She was so embaressed when everyone found out, that she went home and put the red cloth on her face, which makes the person go to sleep for ass long ass the cloth is covering the face. So in the end, we were all so happy to figure out that the actual amount of blocks that the spilled coffee would cover is actually 696969, and we all drank coffee afterwards, and it was great! Bryce and Karissa told me that they wanted to move to Kansas together, and Sharkisha and her manbearpig moved to Provincetown up in Cape Cod, where they said that &quot;their kind of people&quot; live. I was not quite sure on what they meant by that, but I was just so glad that the manbearpig ran away to Provincetown to live with Sharkisha. Although, I did hear that manbearpig found another manbearpig up in Provincetown and came to the realization that they were meant to be with each other. So, Sharkisha went back to the red cloth forever, the two manbearpigs got married and had three children: one man, one bear, and one pig. They tried to have a fourth child but it came out ass just a bearpig and everyone knows that bearpigs are discriminated against in Provincetown, for they only accept a certain type of people into their community, so they aborted their bearpig one month after conception. What a shame, because bearpigs are so rare these days, so I guess that might have been the bearpigs only hope as a race, because I know that the world only has one other bearpig for the aborted bearpig to have conceived a child with. It is such a pity that there is discrimination in Provincetown, and I think I have a way to stop the discrimination! Do you want to hear it? I think you do. If you have stuck with me thus far through this awesome explanation, then I think you can <b>bear</b> with me for the rest of the time given to finish up this. So i think we should take the aborted one month old bearpig and show it to the public on our commercial coming up for the coffee event! Once everyone sees how purdy the bearpigs are, they will not want them to be discriminated against any more, which is why i am going to make it my soul purpose to go and dig up the bearpig, get back in time for the commercial, and show the bearpig on television and tell everyone that this race is being discriminated against in the world we live in today, and come on, its the 21st century! It does not matter to them i guess, so i will have to be very sneaky on how to get the bearpig on national tv without anyone noticing that they are in the prescense of a bearpig until the commercial comes on. So, I was thinking on putting the bearpig in the coffee cup, and when they go to spill the coffee, the bearpig will come out and that will be my queue to tell everyone that they need to stop and let the bearpigs flourish once more in this world! What do you think of my idea? Do you like it? Everyone I have told so far has thought of it to be very gross and uncomforting, because we are all going to drink out of the coffee. Well, I do not care, because i am not much of a coffe person, so it doesnt matter to me what happens in terms of diseases to them or anyone that wants to drink out of the big coffee cup. Well, I guess now would be a good time to get on to question 3, so bye.</p>",2687,2694,,,,0,,,,,,I,,,

Instead of focusing on the amount of coffee that would spill in an already developed, more than likely wealthy nation, why don't we instead turn our attention to more pressing matters such as children who are dying of starvation in third world countries.&nbsp; So therefore, if the newscaster is correct and 400 gallons spilled will flood half a city block, then there will be some cleaning to do, however it probably will not put a dent in that city's finances.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I really must ask, how is the coffee fountain being supported? It appears to me that a coffee pot is just floating in the air, like it is possessed by the Devil or something? Like seriously it is just floating.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This test&nbsp; is a waste of my time. Oh and good job to the newscaster for actually getting a REAL job, making real money. She probably makes triple of what Bryce, Karissa, and I make. Good for the newscaster. I'm going to guess her name is Lana? I think it is Lana. Lana the newscaster.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&copy;Me 2014</p>",4187,3053,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,

Based on the facts that were given to us we know that near the mall, an average city block is about 300 ft by 300 ft and one gallon of water covers about 13.8 square feet, there by stating that half a city block is 150 based on the fact that 150+150= 300. Also since the amount of square feet coverage is given for water then it is logical to that in order to prove this theory that 13.8*150 would equal the number of gallons that the coffee/ water holds, but since the answer I got is little out of proportion than what the diagram says the amount of gallons is then his theory would be incorrect with the number of gallons amounting to 2070.

He always carries two magnums; one is a gun, and he keeps it loaded; the other is a bottle and it keeps <b>him</b> loaded. Operation Coffee pot was a high-security, intel-gathering mission. The goal was to infiltrate the mall--the place where U.S. ops like to hang out and share secrets. The giant coffee cup, which was hollow in the bottom, was loaded with monitoring and transmitting systems that helped give information to those Red Soviet beezies. In the case of an emergency, the coffee cup was designed to leak all of its coffee onto the floor which would effectively kill everything in the area (due to the incredible acidity of the substance).

When she says the fountain actually holds 400 gallons, she is wrong. The coffee fountain can hold up to aroud 1760 gallons. Now when the newscaster states that if the fountain were to break, the 400 gallons of coffee would cover half of a city block. Wrong, an average city block is about 90,000 square feet or 300 feet by 300 feet. One gallon of coffee would cover about 13.8 square feet. Now when you take the 400 gallons multiplied by 13.8 square feet, you get 5,520 square feet in total the 400 gallons of coffee would cover. 5,520 is not even close to being half of 90,000 square feet.

This was the last one, and if she wouldn't fail. Bryce, on his black steed, raced down the hill right by her side. The army followed behind them shouting and yelling. Karissa marveled at their bravery. They were pretty much running to their deaths, and yet they remained loyal to her and to Bryce, and did not give up or run away. The dark enemy was laid spread out in front of them. Their spears came forward to protect themselves, and she heard one of their captains shout a releasing order. &quot;Arrows!&quot; she called to her The thuds of the arrows came down. She held her shield over her head to protect herself. The enemy now lay only a few yards infront of her. This is it, she said to herself again. She would not fail. She could not fail. She swung her heavy sword, breaking the forming line of the enemy. Her army had the advantage of the horses, which trampled over the bodies of the enemy below. She fought like a madwoman, using all of her strength in every swing. She brought down two or three enemies with each blow. Suddenly, something from behind her grabbed her and pulled her off her horse. She fell to the ground with a thud, but was quickly on her feet again to face an enormous, heavy man. He looked like a bear, in Karissa's opinion. His face was covered with thick black hair, and his skin was incredibly dark. He flashed a white smirk down at her. He held an enormous axe in one hand, and a monstrous sword in the other. &quot;Time to die,&quot; he said, then lifted his sword to make a swing. She ducked out of the way, rolling in between his legs and standing up behind him. As he was turning around, she drove her sword into the back of his neck. He screeched, then fell to the ground, dead. On the ground, Karissa found more and more pursuers, but she killed them off easily. She continued to fight for what seemed hours. When the sun was beginning to set, Karissa found herself becoming very weak. Blood trickled down her face, down her arms, everywhere that skin was exposed. Sweat spilled into the cuts, bringing a sharp pain to the wounds Karissa had obtained. A loud shout came from the east. She turned to see, and her heart dropped. It was him. It was the one who started all of this, and who had caused her so much pain, and he was coming right for her. A smile flashed across his face. &quot;Well well well, we meet again.&quot; Karissa spat at his feet, glaring up into his evil eyes. &quot;Any last words, Karissa my sweet?&quot; Karissa raised her sword. &quot;My words will be the last words you ever get to hear,&quot; she growled. He laughed, then suddenly lunged forward toward her. She blocked his blow with her sword, and shoved him backward, but he pursued again. Over and over he pursued, and she blocked. Her arms were beginning to ache, and he seemed to come at her with full energy and strength. She had been confident before, but now, she didn't know if she could do it. Just as she thought this, he swiped a blow at the back of her legs, knocking her to her knees. He grabbed her arms and knocked the sword out of her hand. He then placed his sword against her neck. &quot;You might as well just admit it, you will always lose.&quot; He moved his sword to finish her off. Karissa shut her eyes, but the blow never came. She opened one eye to see a headless man standing infront of her. She cringed backward and jumped to her feet. The headless body fell to the ground. Behind the body was Bryce. He looked down at the body in disgust, bloodied sword raised. He then looked up at Karissa. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; he asked her. She couldn't say anything. She just ran up to him and wrapped grateful arms around him. She didn't know why, but tears began to form in her eyes. &quot;You saved me,&quot; she whispered against his neck. &quot;I'll always be here to save you,&quot; he whispered in her ear, then placed a kiss on her neck. &quot;Captain!&quot; a voice sounded. Both Karissa and Bryce looked in the direction of the voice. It was one of their leaders. &quot;We have victory!&quot; he shouted. They looked around to see that the enemy had surrendered. They had did so when Bryce cut off the head of their leader. Karissa breathed a sigh of relief. She had did it. She had won.</p>",3053,2694,,,,,,,,,I,I,,,

Half of that, which was the reporter's claim, is 45000 sq. feet. Because the coffee only occupies 5520 sq. feet, it would not, in fact, cover 50% of a city block, but a measely 6.133%.

The amount of coffee in the coffee cup would only cover 5,520 square feet, whereas a city block is 900,000 square feet. One could determine this by calculating the amount of area that the coffee in the coffee cup would cover and compare it to the area of a city block. To discover the amount of area the coffee would cover, you would found the product of the amount of gallons of coffee and how much area one gallon of coffee would cover(400x13.8). If done correctly, the total would be 5,520 square feet. Next, you would find the area of the city block by multiplying the width by the length(300x300), giving you 900,000. It is obvious that 5,520 square feet is much less than 900,000 square feet. Thus concluding that the amount of coffee in the coffe cup wpuld not cover an entire city block. You would need over 65,000 gallons of coffee to cover a city block.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Making a ratio with one gallon over 13.8 square feet equaling G, gallons over 45,000 square feet (because 45,000 is half of 90,000) will help you find the answer to how many gallons it would take to fill half of a city block.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The average city mall is 300 feet by 300 feet. If multiply it would be 90,000 feet covering about 5520 feet of the block.

I can see how she could have possibly gotten this answer but I believe it is incorrect. I had calculated the information that the newscaster had stated. She said there is 400 gallons of coffee and one gallon of water covers about 13.8 square feet. So I had multiplied 400 with 13.8 and the amount comes out to 55,200 square feet. Also to find the exact square feet is in a city block I had multiplied 300 times 300 and found it to be 90,000 square feet. So in finding the amount of space both objects I wanted to find what was actually half of a city block. And the answer is 45,000 square feet. So really the coffee would take up about 10,000 square feet more. So her argument isn't invalid but it is incorrect... by alot. She states that &quot;the 400 gallons of coffee would cover the equivalent of half a city block&quot;. And im pretty sure that 55,200 square feet is not half the size of a city block.

This is due to the basic law that molecules move around eachother; it is possible for one molecule to move out of the way and allow the passage of 1 molecule of coffee. With this in mind, we can state that there is a chance that ALL of the molecules of coffee can bypass the floor and instead move straight into the ground. If we think about it this way, the news reporter could be entirely justified in their statement that the coffee would cover half a block of space. The rest of the coffee could simply go underground, never to be seen again. Though highly unlikely, it is possible. Please give me your thoughts on this concept.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However given the nature of this question and assuming that this giant coffee pot really can be suspended in the air by Quantum Physics or another science of that nature, I would say that no, the coffee will not cover the entire block.

VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,7603044,11,12330963,"<p>In order for the coffee cup fountain to hold 400 gallons of coffee the coffee would spill over half of a city block. If an average city block is about 300 by 300 feet, that would make half of it 150 by 150 feet. If a gallon of water covers 13.8 square feet, and there's 400 gallons of coffee you would multiply 13.8 and 400 to have the amount of square feet that 400 gallons would cover. When you discover that 400 gallons would cover 5520 square feet which is less than that half of a city block. The coffee cup would contain more than 400 gallons of coffee in order to cover the equivalent of half a city block.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VALIDATION,B,N,N,M,11727800,11,12331048,"<p>im a sorry to tell you that your statement is nowhere near half a block.</p> <p>See hear now i have heard this and i wanted to see if this was true so i did a little research, and i found out that a city block is 90,000 sq feet, and one gallon of water covers 13.8 sq feet of water. i figure out that 400 gallons only covers 5,520 sq ft. You said that it would cover half a block so i went 90,000 divided by 2 and i got 45,000 sq ft. Which 5,520 is no were close to this number and is a difference of&nbsp; 39480 sq ft.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
