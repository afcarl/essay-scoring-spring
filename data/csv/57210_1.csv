It is extremely simple to look up a subject on Wikipedia and to write up on the subject for a class or for some other means. While it is unlikely that most information on Wikipedia is fabricated, simply editing in false information isn't difficult. In the article, &quot;Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media with Fake Quote&quot;, by Shawn Pogatchnik of the Seattle Times. Pogatchnik reports of the social experiment that Irish student Shane Fitzgerald conducted. He made up an uncited quote that was attributed to the late Maurice Jarre.

A month had passed and the fabrication had not been spotted until Fitzgerald alerted the media sources. Some sources had still misattributed the quote to Jarre several weeks after Fitzgerald alerted the public. The sheer simplicity of taking a quote from a concise and popular well of information, even though the well is user-submitted and the quote had no citations of its sources proved to be too tempting for many journalists and showed the decreasing interest of firsthand sources of a subject. Another example of misinformation spread by means of Wikipedia can be seen in Noam Cohen's article in the Taipei Times, &quot;Wikipedia on an Academic Hit List.&quot; Neil Waters of Middlebury College, Vermont had seen several of his students written on exams using information that was completely incorrect. Upon further investigation, Waters discovered that Wikipedia was the source of misinformation, several of his students had used Wikipedia as a last minute cram option for their exams.

This effect is evident in source #5 as well where Neil Water's Japanese history class asserted that &quot;the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-century Japan&quot; (Source #5) which was impossible because the Jesuits were few in number and those that existed were in hiding.

In source #4 it talks about a Dublin university student named Shane Fitzgerald that was doing a sociology experiment to see how fast false information on the site Wikipedia could spread. There was a Wikipedia page on the French composer Maurice Jarre. Jarre had died just hours before and Shane saw his chance to do his experiment, so he posted a quote on the page that was supposedly said by the composer but was not. And sure enough within a couple of hours of that quote being on the page, journalists from all over Europe had swooped in and copied it to put in their obituaries on the deceased composer. To Fitzgerald's surprise his experiment had worked profoundly more than he had imagined. The team at Wikipedia that edits the site and checks the reliability of the entries, found the quote and erased it as soon as they found it, but some journalists had already picked up the information. Fitzgerald did release a statement saying that he was the one who posted the quote and was doing it for research purposes. His experiment shows that anything that is put on the internet will be used by people, and that it can spread like wild fire. People that use Wikipedia rarely check the validity of the information that they are receiving and just assume that whoever did post the article was being truthful about it, some people even believe that others can not just edit Wikipedia as they please. This goes to show that whoever does use a site like Wikipedia should check how valid the information that they retained is before they start spreading it to others. Also information on Wikipedia, whether true or false, may spread very quickly do to the number of users that are on the site. In source #1 it shows a graph on the percentage of adults in America that use the internet compared to the percentage of those that use Wikipedia. By 2010 79% of adults in America used the internet, and 42% of them used Wikipedia as a source. With this bulk of people using the site it's no wonder that information on topics can spread so quickly whether it is valid or not. No matter what it is the more people that see it the more likely it is that it is going to be spread, and eventually some people will even start to believe it is true if they have heard it from enough people. Misinformation on Wikipedia does spread extremely fast and those that use the site should double check the information before using it in articles or just retelling it to their friends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
