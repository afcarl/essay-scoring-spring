(always voilence except niagara got escpecially raunchy schoolgirls) The deafening blow of the c4 filled the air as the door protecting the main control center of the facility flew off its hinges. It was a very large rooms filled with many computers and monitors. In the middle was a maximun security chamber containing the the worst disease known to man-B.I.E.B.S (bathing in exo-skeletons of bieber syndrome) It was truly a nasty virus that absolutely no cure. It wiped out 97.6% of the civillian population on earth.

There wasnt a single human being in the room. All of the computers were still running like someone hurriedly left them. And worst of all, in the middle of the room the chamber was wide open, oozing out the B.I.E.B.S. It hit us like a storm of locusts flying through a desert.

I know this because from their current location to base camp is 60 miles. From their current location to the South Pole, the distance is 15 miles. The group plans to go back to the camp and pass their former location from the South Pole. So, if they are going to the South Pole, and expect to pass their current location, that is 30 miles in that stretch.

Im not quiet sure but I think that maybe this time I got it right. see you have to count up the miles on the way to the south pole, and the distance from the camp to where the group started. You would have to multiply the distance from the group to amp by itself to get that part. and the multiply the distance from the south pole from where the group started. And add those totals up and then square root them when they are combined into one.. Then you got your awnser to the propblem:) so like the way to base camp from the group is 60 miles and the way to the south pole is 15 miles. so you would do 15*15 and you get 225 and then do 60 * 60 and you get 3600 and ad dthose to together and you get 3825. you have to square root that so it becomes you answer and if you square root that you get like 62 miles if rounded. so you have to treavel 62+15+60 and that equals 137 and thats the miles you have to go. :)</p>",4138,5487,331,,,1,0,0,,,,,,,
