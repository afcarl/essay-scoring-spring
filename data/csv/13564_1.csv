So with that said, the original box is cheaper and will help the business save .99 cents and it will still help the donuts hold together at least.

The surface area of the original box was 216 square inches. The equation for that was 2(10x6+10x3+3x6). But it was still in inches, I needed it to be in feet. On the table it says that 144 inches squared = 1 foot squared. So, I divided 216 by 144 and got .33. ( 33 cents) For the new box I did the same thing but with different numbers. I found the surface area of the&nbsp; box, which was 434 inches squared, with the equation 2(15x11+15x2+11x2). I then divided that by 144 to get 0.4520833333.

Notice how it says &quot;per square foot&quot; not $22 or $15 per box. Since the dollar amount goes by how many square feet there are, the new box is the highest costing. For the original box, add 10, 6, and 3. With this, you get 19<u>in</u>. But that's just in <u>inches </u>it must be in feet, so convert 19 inches to feet and you get 1 7/12. So that's 22$ for the first foot, now divide 22 by 12 and you get 1.83. Now multiply 7 by 1.83 to get 12.81. So add the 12.81 to the $22 and you get $34.81. Now that's only the price for the original box.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to find the price for the new box, you need to add 15, 11, and 2, in which you end up with 28<u>in</u> now remember that that's just in inches. We need to convert the 28 inches to feet. 12 can go into 28 2 times with only four inches leftover, so that would be 2 4/12. 15 by 2 is 30 so for the whole numbers, there would be $30 so far. divide 15 by 12 and you get 1.25. Now multiply 4 by 1.25, which equals 5. Finally add 5 to 30 and you get $35.

For the original box I multiplied the length and the width (10 x 6), divided it by 2 and multiplied by 3. After I got the answer to the original box, I multiplied that by the cost per square feet for the original box which was 0.22. The answer I had got to that problem was 19.8, which I then added that to the number I got from the first problem which was 90 inches squared, and the sum was $109.80. The new box's answer was 165 inches squared after doing the first problem and multiplied 165 by 0.15 and got $189.75.

Also the new box costs a lot less that the old box, about 0.07 less, or 7 cents less. Wich that small amount of money can go to making more dounuts or upgradeing the shop if you save enough. Or to even create new donuts, you need to have the money for it. When you take 10 by 6 by 3 and divide by 3 you get 433.3 repeating.

TRAINING,W,N,N,F,11488338,7,10239858,"<p>The co-worker that claims the new box would cost less is inncorrect. She only looked at the prices per square foot of cardboard not the amount of squeare feet each box is. To find out which box is cheeper you must look at the cost of carsboard per square feet and the dimesnsions of each box. To find out the total cost for the original box you would first look at the dimesions of the box which are; 10 inches long 6 inches wide and 3 inches tall. To start you must now find the surface area of the box. To do this you will; !0 times 6 inches which is 60 inches and than multiply 60 inches by 2 since there are two of the sides that are that length. Than you will multiply 10 inches by 3 inches and you will get 30 inches and you will also muliply this by two since there are two sides with the same dimensions, after you multiply 30 inches by 2 inches you will get 60 inches. Than for the lst two sides of the donut box you will multiple 3 inches by 6 inches and you will get 18 inches. Than because the box has two sides of the same lenght than you will multiply 18 inches by 2 and get 36 inches. Now we have the surface area for every&nbsp; one of the sides so we need to add them together to get the totall amount of square inches the box is. So we add 120+60+36=216 inches squared for the original box. Than since the cardboard is sold in square feet not square inches we need to convert the square inches to square feet. Since there are 144 square inches in one foot you will divide 216 by 144 and you will get 1.5 square feet. Than since we now know that the original box is 1.5 square feet we can multiply 1.5 by 0.22 (because it is 22 cents per square foot.) Than you will end up with .33 meaning that the cost for the original box is 33 cents. Now we go on to the new box which has the dimensions 15 inches long 11 inches wide and 2 inches high. To start you will need to find the surface area for every side. So we will multiple 15 by 2 and get 30 inches than you will multiply 30 inches by 2 since there are two of that side and you get 60 inches. Than for the next sides you multiply 11 inches by 2 inches and get 22 inches than you multiply 22 inches by 2 since there are two sides with thes edimensions and you will get 44 inches. Than for our last two sides you need to multiply 15 inches by 11 inches and you will get 165 inches and than you need to multiply 165 inches&nbsp; by 2 since there are two sides with these dimensions and you will get 330 inches. Now we have the area for each side so we need to find the surface area of the whole box. to find the surface area of the whole box we will add 330+44+60=434 square&nbsp; inches. Now we know the surface area of the box in square inches but since the cardboard is is sold in square feet we must convert this to square feet. Since there are 144 square inches in every square foot we need to divide 434 by 144 and after doing this we get 3.01 square feet than because the cost of cardbourd per square feet is 15 cents we need to multiply this by .15 which gives us .45 which is 45 cents. So the cost of the original box was 33 cents and the new box is 45 cents. There for the original box is cheeper by 12 cents.</p>",2674,384,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,

( just like this SBAC test!) yes i do like this test in fact i enjoy the SBAC testing a lot, and i prefer this than regular school tests and CMT's Thank you for your time, and i do apologize for what i have said on the technology test and for going on a rant like that, i really didnt mean it i was just upset that day and i thought it was very rude of me to say something like that on a test! I am very sorry!! And just so you know i really didnt mean anything i said in that previos test but everything i say in this one i do really mean!! so i hope you read it and consider it! i really put a lot of effort into what&nbsp; i said so it would be a shame if you didnt read it or even consider the possiblities of how much help it would bring to schools across the US! that last test was basically me venting out on a stressful day insted of yelling at someone or being cranky when i got home! Again, im truly sorry! and without further a do, i give you my best, honest and nice opinion ( i dont know :P) anyway you may begin reading it if you like, its rather interesting! ) &rArr;</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&curren;&nbsp;I just wanted to say excuse me for my response to the one of&nbsp; last tests i took (technology in the classroom) i guess i was getting a little carried away with the point i was trying to make the real thing i was trying to say was that i really just was bothered by the fact that students have homework, and the fact that not all of us have the time to spend everyday for more than an hour studying for a test because we get home from school we qant to relax not spend more time doing work and by the time we get home to the time we get back from school there really isnt a lot of time to relax since most of us do sports and other after school activities plus dinner there really isnt enough time to just do hw and study and because of this fact many students dont even study and rely on what they remeber from calss to help them do this test and if they do study, they only can for a few minutes or so and the forget everything the day of the test due to stress ( an example of why we should be allowed to look over a study guide for less than 2 minutes before a test that way we have a good idea of what to prepare for since some of the questions arent the exact same as the are on the test than the study guide.) and when we get home from school we want to relax not do more work in a short amount of time before after school activities ad the average school day bedtime (9:00 PM) and espically on the weekends when we have a full day to do whatever we want and more time to relax. In fact, it would be better if students had homework on weekends since we would have more time to do it (not a lot of homework though because we still want to relax!) that way if the schools still wanted to keep tests we can study during weekdays, do homework on weekends (saturday or sunday), and then relax for the rest of the day! this will cause less stress in most students and students wouldnt have to stress over that they have to do their homework because its due the next day and if they dont they get a detention. If homework was given on just weekends students would have 2 days to complete a small amount of work and relax the next day and when we go back to school on monday, same thing applies with work packets over summer break the only thing is they really arent needed and students can deal without them to be honest, they really arent nessecary since teachers dont grade them and there is no punishment for not bringing them ( besides not getting ice cream or not gettng your name put in a raffle) sure they refresh the summer brains of kids but do you really think that some kids dont get stuck on certain math problems? Do you really think they remember something that was taught in the begging of the year? no! if anything these packets dont help at all because most kids just guess on these packets in reality</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&curren;<b> </b>so there really is no need for the math packets but kids can do with the language arts packets because its simple to just read 2 books over 2-3 months but i do ask that you consider making projects a little easier and smaller so its less stressful for students, that way more students would bring in a projec rather than deciding not to do one because the choices are difficult or confusing. if anything you should let students pick what they&nbsp; want to do for a project! :)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>thats all for now ~Janelys ^.^</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
