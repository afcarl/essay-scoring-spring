It was 15 miles to the South Pole now the grou must go to their camp. Since the group, South Pole, and camp create a right triangle to find the distance between South Pole and Camp we need to use the Pathageron Theroem(A squared + B squared = C squared). A is 3 units and B is 12 units. 3 squared is 9 and 12 squared is 144. 144 + 9 equals 153 meaning that C squared is equal to 153. To find c we must find the sqaure root of 153. There is no exact number for it but the closest is 12.37 which equals to 153.0169.So to find the distance we need to multiply 12.37 by 5 becuase every unit is 5 miles. 12.37x5=61.85. 61.85 miles+15 miles=76.85 miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",5136,421,71,,,0,1,1,,,,,,,

Which is 15miles. Then I calculated the distance from the group to the camp and that was 60 miles. I did this by counting all the squares which each represented 5 miles. Now that I have the two distances, I can use them to help me find the distance from the south pole, to the camp. With two distances already found out, I use Pathagorum Therom. a squared plus b squared equals c squared. 15 squared plus 60 squared equals 3855 miles. With that answer, I divided it by the 5 mile measurement on the map which came down to 771 miles. After finding the distance from the South Pole to the camp, I added the distance from the Group to the South Pole to the distance from the South Pole to the Camp and came up with the answer of 786 miles for how far the group traveled.</p>",5103,421,71,,,0,1,0,,,,,,,
