Even the word porcupine comes from french words that mean &quot;spiny pig.&quot; But porcupines are not pigs. Like mice, squirrels, and beavers, they're rodents____animals with four front teeth built especially for gnawing. Call World Full of Food. It's easy to gnaw wood, with porcupine teeth. The front pairs___top and bottom___are strong and sharp. A tough orange coating protects their outer surface. As the porcupine gnaws, it sharpens these teeth by wearing away the backs faster then the front. Because the teeth grow for its whole life, they don't ever wear out. During winter, porcupines use their big front teeth to scrape off bark. Then they eat the tender woody parts of shrubs and trees. They also nibble salty soil. Call World of Words. Porcupines don't have much to say. That's because they spend a lot of their time alone. They &quot;talk&quot; a bit when they're looking for mates and caring for their young. Sometimes they warn enemies___such as fishers, mountain lions, wolves, and people___to leave them alone. Porcupine warnings come in three forms___sight, sound, nd smell. The sharp difference between the light and dark hair on an adult's back and tail makes it easy to spot at night. If an enemy appears, the porcupine turns its back and uses its body like a flag. &quot;Go away,&quot; it's saying.",564,124,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,
