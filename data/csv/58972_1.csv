Reason being for this problem is that when a student needs money for college and can't find a part time job due to the toughness of the economy its too hard to pay the college what they want in return of your education. So now the student has no choice but to borrow more and more money from them and didn't even think twice about how hard it is to pay them back. Once an immature student has too much money at one time they believe they can waste it on unneccessary products such as a new tv or an iphone. Once then who is gonna pay off this huge debt if the student cannot, it is then forced on the people to pay through tax dollars for that person(s) idiotic behavior. Then once another student does it, then another, and another, now everyone is in debt and it's costing the whole economy this debt crisis. In some cases however, it's not always the students fault. Say he cannot find a job and can't go to school unless he borrows money well in that case he had no choice. Those are the people that deserve their debts to be set free and not be bound against them.",241,113,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,

While student debt is a huge problem and amnesty programs are just allowing students to continue not paying off their college loans, there might be some positive things to letting the loans just &quot;slide&quot; so the students can enjoy their college experience without having to fork out their savings. No student wants to pay what money they have been saving up since they were in grade school on their education if they really want to spend that money on getting an apartment or renting a condo after they graduate college. Allowing for amnesty programs rids students of the stressful nights where they have to think about how they're going to eventually pay off their student debt, aside from studying for tests and paying gas and food bills. With amnesty programs, young adults are eased into the real&quot;adult world&quot; because they won't get slapped in the face with a huge debt right out of college. Sure, they will eventually have to pay off other debts but in the meantime it's a huge relief to be cut some slack, especially if students are being stressed out with the other components of their still maturing lives.",803,241,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,

The number 20,000 is largly false too. Colleges that I've been looking at are 60,000 A YEAR. The debt we face when leaving college isnt something that these older generations will ever have to deal with. older generations look at eachother and ask why we are so full of angst, why we are unhappy and angry when anyone says anything about the future. this is because we are faced not only with the struggle of debt, no job, no way to get a house, and unhealthy eating habits because we cant even AFFORD to by healthy food like vegetables that cost $6 dollars just for some spinach, we are also faced with people who say that we cant do it, they say that we are the generation that doesnt care about the world, that we are the generation that arent responsible enough to deal with the money problems that YOU, older generations, laid out for us.

Also, opponents of this proposition argue that once this debt is forgiven, many students will just become more in debt hoping it will be forgiven, or spend the freed income from forgiven debt on frivolous items. Some also believe that if loans are forgiven once, it will begin a continuous trend of amnesty for loans. Since the cost of public four year college tuition has increased over three times the amount that it was 30 years ago, college debt in this country has the potential to increase just as exponentially as it has the last 30 years if we continue to let it grow. We need to start anew, cut out the profit-skimming middleman of public four year universities and create a public college system similar to our highschool system. This may cause more expense to the U.S. initially, but if a larger amount of students are given the chance to have successful, high-paying jobs, in the decades to come tax revenue will increase greatly. This will balance the costs of setting up this new system, and also cover the existing debt.

Also, forgiving the college debt will just lead to students asking for more loans and they will eventually accumulate more debt.

Finally, the cost of college tuition is rising so the debt rate will increase with it.

With this college debt being forgiven may come the notion that futures debts that are not related to school may also be payed off by someone other than the current student themself. While this may have more serious consequences in their futures, in the short term it may also influence students to further establish more college loan debt. I do not agree with these insinuations because the students that would be recieving this help will not be so jaded as to expect further help. They have already maintained a healthy GPA and show a dedication to their future in planning to continue their education into college. These are not the type of people that would be content to keep their education going by living off handouts, there for they would not fall into this false sense of security that the opposition assumes will accompany this debt forgiveness program. Because these students would be saving so much money by way of this program, the question of what they will be spending their savings on is posed. The opposition to this program argues that this money will be spent on what some would consider to be &quot;frivolous items&quot;, but with these students I doubt that this would be the case. In attending college they have made it clear that they would like to be productive members of society, and economic stability is a part of that. Those who would benefit from this program would not be likely to pour their savings into frivolity, but would rather be too consumed with their studies to engage in this behavior. In this day and age of baby boomers criticizing the younger generations for their dependence on hand outs, the &quot;tax payer&quot; perspective plays a large role in our nations political arena. Those who abide by this way of thinking that all tax payer money they give will automatically go towards things that they do not support, argue that the one trillion dollars that taxpayers have already put into these programs is enough and that the students and their families should be paying their own way for the aforementioned students' education. This however, is easier said than done. Many families cannot afford the massive amount of college debt to befall them should one or all of their children were to attend college. The students themselves also cannot pay off this debt alone hence the need for this program. Those in society who do not support tax payer assistance of other's college education have forgotten that the key to a successful and competitive nation today in our world is the education of our youth.
