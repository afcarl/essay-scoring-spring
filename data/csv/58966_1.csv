Most of student body will agree, that we need ice cream back in our cafeteria. Though the school administration and the parents would disagree, ice cream is a vital development to a teens healh. Before you think this is another rant about the SBAC I would like to point out that I am not ranting but protesting the education system and standardized tests. 1st-5th grade I went to a private school and had straight Fs in all the core subjucts through 1st through 5th grade. I did not pay attention in class causing me to not understand the subject which then paralized me from doing my work. Countless times I was told to pay attention by my teacher but I never listened. You may think &quot;Well it's your fault you didn't pay attention&quot; but then, I transferred to public school in 6th grade then began to get higher grades, working my way up from a D. Time passed and I reached high school then I looked around and saw that I had become so used to getting good grades, I began to fear fail. Even though we are taught fail is a vital part of sucess. I thought of my self as stupid when I was younger for not paying attention, though, I might of been smarter back then than I am now. Because I remembered while the rest of the class was studying to pass, I was writing stories in the back of the class. Or when we were writing essays, I was doodling in my notebook contemplating life in an alternet universe. I passed music and art class with flying colors but, when it came to math I was stuck in the gutters. I wasn't afraid to fail because by societies tems I was already failing. So why do I score low on Algebra tests when I can name the majority of countries on a world map? Or why can I write fictional stories with ease when I get writers block while writing an essay? It's because I work that way and I won't let society tell me I'm useless and stupid because of some grade on a test that I won't even need for the rest of my life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
