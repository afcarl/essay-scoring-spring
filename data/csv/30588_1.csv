He started to think very hard. Until he thought of something that he thought was really fun. So, he bolted into the playroom and took out a lego kit. The only problem was that he couldn't open the package. He went to his Mom, but she couldn't help Charles because her hands were all messy from making the meal. So she said to go to Dad. Charles walked to Dad doubting that he would help Charles open the package but when Charles asked his Dad if he could open the package he was too busy decorating the inside of the house so he wouldn't help Charles. Charles just thought and remembered that scissors could cut right through the tape on the package so he sprinted to his supply closet and picked out a green pair of scissors. He could now cut the tape to put together the lego set! When he opened all the bags in the package, he couldn't stop putting together the lego set that he had. Right when Charles finished building his lego kit, all his cousins came and Charles yelled: &quot;Eat as much as you want!&quot; Charles finally got to eat his meal and satisfy his stomach.",210,644,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,

TRAINING,W,N,N,F,201893,3,10205549,"I think how the story could end is, Charles could maybe ask his mom to go to his next door neghbors house, and play because when his mom said i know its hard being the only child Charles,he could just play with his pals or buddies across the street, and play anything thats not related to food, because if he sees food he'll just get even more hungry. Another ending for the story is Charles could just get a puppie because you know what they say, a dog is every mans best friend, and when he plays with the dog he wont even think about the food being done, because his food thoughts would be out of this world. they will smash into the moon and make a dent and that way when astronauts fly in the crazy spaceship, they will see the dent from Charles hunger.Meanwhile after Charles space hunger heres another idea what could be an ending if Charles cant get, a dog, or go to his neighbors house. If he has a playground he could go outside and go on the swings, and whoosh all his hunger out and swoosh the blue skys in, and swoosh the gray skys out, then go on the monkey bars and swing those floppy legs all over and go all the way across, then go down the slide and go back to your swings.
