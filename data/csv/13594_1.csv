TRAINING,W,N,N,F,8992276,7,10237133,"<p>To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, you do not add up the sides, and add the area. Eric took the length of the box and multiplied it by two, because there are two sides with that length, then he did the same with the width. You do not do that to find surface area. He then took the area and added it to the sum of the sides. Another mistake that Eric made was that he did not find the surface area of the whole box. He left out four sides. To find the surface area of this specific donut box, you must first find the area of all the sides. In this case, there will be 3 pairs of sides with the same areas. 12.5 x 11= 137.5. Because there is another side of the box with the same dimensions, I will multiply 137.5 by 2. I am doing this because, when finding the surface area, you find the areas of all the sides then add them together, this will speed up the process. The next step is to multiply 11 by 2. This will give us 22, and since there is another side with the same measurements the answer will be 44. The second to last step is to solve the equation; 12.5 x 2=? The answer will be 25, and because there are two sides that are congruent, the answer will be 50. The last step is to add up all of the areas of the sides. 137.5(2) + 22(2) + 25(2) or 275 + 44 + 50= 369. The surface area of this donut box is 369 square inches.</p>",2838,5492,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,

Also, he already multipled the length by 2 and he didn't include the height. To find the correct surface are, I have to change the 12.5 multiplied by 11 to 2, which is the height by 2. Now there is six sides, two 12.5s, two 11inches, and two 2 inches. Next I have to change the 137.5 to 4 because the height times two does not equal 137.5.

TRAINING,W,N,N,F,11647869,7,10238142,"<p>When Eric was trying to solve this Math problem, he forgot one step in the process of finding the surface area of the doughnut box. What Eric did was find the areas of all three surfaces on one side of the box. Then he went straight to adding them to get what he thought was the surface area. Eric's answer was 184.5. However the correct answer should be 369. The step that Eric forgot was to multiply the three areas by 2 because there is still and another side of the box, but you just can't see it. So what Eric should have done was multiply the three areas 25, 22, and 137.5 all by 2, because those are the areas for one side. The answer he should have gotten for that step was 50 when you multiply 25 times 2, 44 when you multiply 22 times 2, and 275 when you multiply 137.5 times 2.

VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,12122582,7,12324561,"<p>Eric's error was that he forgot to multiply the products by two. He multiplied 12.5 by 2, 11 by 2, and 12.5 by 11, and then added their products together to find what he thought was the surface area. But really, all he found was half of the surface area. O fix this, he could multiply the products of 12.5 times 2; 11 times 2, and 12.5 times 11 by two to get the correct answer of 369 square inches. Another way to fix this is to multiply Eric's final answer by 2, still to get a final answer of 369 square inches.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
