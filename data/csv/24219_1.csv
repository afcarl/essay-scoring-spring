TRAINING,W,N,N,M,6341335,3,10227827,"<br>First, you need to do all of the math that tells you what amount of money you spent on each costume. To do this, you need to multipy the cost of that costume by how many of that costume you need: Sport costs $15. You need two sports costumes: $15 x 2 = $30. Do this with all of the costumes: Western: $20 x 2 = $40. Cartoon: $25 x 1 = $25. Superhero: $30 x 2 = $60. Fairytale: $35 x 2 = $70. <br>With these numbers in mind, we can go onto step #2. You need to add up all of these different numbers. Here's a simple way to do it: add sports and western = $70. Cartoon and superhero = $85. Fairytale = $70. Then add these numbers together: $70 + $70 = $140. Add $140 + 85 = $225. <br>The last step is to compare your result and the amount of money Ryan needs to spend. Your result was $225. Ryan's amount that he needed to spend was $225. Are they the same? They are! Ryan has found the perfect number of costumes, but wuth your help.",544,235,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,

We will put the price of the cartoon costume under the 40. The price is 25. Now, multiplication again! Superhero costume price:30! 30&bull;2=60, we will put it under the 25!
