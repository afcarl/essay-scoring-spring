Screaming, sobbing, and grief flood people's emotions, preventing them from thinking straight. However, Jake, the reporter, made wise choices that saved his friend, Paul's, life. Jake, in a crisis, will not panic or let fear take over. He will think even harder and try to solve the problem. In the story told by M.G. Merfeld, Jake is able to keep calm and successfully find his friend by the tip of his ski buried with piles and piles of snow. This acute vision was not a result of freaking out, but thinking and looking like a professional.

In the article, the author states that &quot;Jake followed the three patrolmen as they hurriedly skied halfway down the icy slope to the top of the avalanche debris&quot; (Merfeld). Jake could have stayed up and not followed the patrolmen, but he decided he needed to help, and that's what he did. Later, after Jake noticed Paul's ski, he yelled, &quot;Hey, Thomas. Over here...I see his ski&quot; (Merfeld). This demonstrates how Jake responds rationally in a crisis. Some of us may see the red ski and figure it was a trick of the eye or that we were imagining it, especially when we're anxious, yet Jake responded by calmly telling the patrolmen.",4327,2996,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,

When Paul fell, Jake knew that he was nervous and concerned about Paul, but tried to put these feelings behind him so he could concentrate. When he was calm, he listened to what he had to do. He followed the patrolmen and helped them to search, as he was told. When searching, Jake was very observant. If he noticed something, he did not let it pass him by. Instead, he spoke up to see if his observations made a difference, which they did. For example, he saw a glimmer of light when they were searching and immediately knew it might be a part of Paul' skis, which could help them to find Paul. So, he called the other patrolmen to come look at the light and see if it was Paul. The light was the tip of Paul's ski, and because Paul was with his skis, they were able to find Paul.

Jake followed the three patrolmen as they hurriedly skied halfway down the icy slope to the top of the avalnche debris.&quot; Even during his first day on the job, even over such a long distance, and even with the possiblity of death, Jake still did what was right and followed the patrolmen to try and help.
