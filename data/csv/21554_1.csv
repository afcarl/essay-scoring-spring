However, this number is not a clear majority. In other words, 16-year-old drivers do not have a clear advantage over other ages. A majority in this sense would be if the number of accidents 16-year-old drivers have is about 100,000 less compared to other ages. The difference is 18 year olds and 16 year olds meets this criteria because the value is 96,000, and when rounded up, is 100,000.

He fails to realize that, firstly, the 16-year-old group has also the leasy number of licensed drivers. The reason it is the group with the lowest number of accidents is because it does not have many drivers to get into these accidents to begin with. As a result, it is necessary to compute how many accidents happen per licensed16-year-old on average instead of solely focusing in on the number of accidents.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are 624,000 accidents amongst 16-year-old drivers, who number in 1,634,000. If we take the number of accidents and divide it by the number of drivers, we get about 0.38 accidents per unit. Let's compare this with the average accidents per driver of other groups--17-year olds have 0.30 accidents per unit, 18-year-olds have 0.28, and 19-year-olds have 0.25. These values are all less than that of the16-year-old group, which makes 16-year-olds the likeliest group to gent into accidents.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My case can also be bolstered by Table 2, which shows that 16-year-olds have a 24% chance of getting into accidents, while 17-year-olds only have a 16% chance. This, in sum, shows that 16-year-olds actually have one of the greatest risks for accidents and are actually the least safe teenage drivers.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Better luck next time, Jose!&nbsp;</p>",5457,4121,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,

Also, safe driving does not only take into account the number of accidents, but also moving violations not caught by the police. Finally, the statistics do not actually affect whether or not you will be in an accident or not. Just because the probability that a 16 year old will crash is low does not mean that you would not.

I go to the top public school in LAUSD, and one of the top rated public schools in the entire country. I am taking AP Calculus, AP Us History, AP English Language, AP Human Geography, and AP Pyschology this year, and my SAT score is 2300. Yet, I still had trouble taking this test. If I don't know how to do a majority of the math problems, then I cannot even fathom how everyone else will do on this test. The average CST score for most schools in LAUSD, one of the biggest school districts in the country, was BASIC. The notion that making a test harder will &quot;help&quot; our students and raised America's falling status in education is foolish, and quixotic at best. Maybe we should invest the millions of dollars that come out of the taxpayer's pocket into funding programs, and buying more teachers. There are over fourty students in most of my classes, and you're telling me that tests on Ipads will improve my education? After this year, teacher evaluations and potentially salaries are going to be based on a test that seldom will be able to pass. This will encourage teachers to teach strictly to the test, eliminating creativity and freedom in classrooms. You're telling me that squandering individualism and teaching to a set of guidelines is improving my education? Students in New York have been taking this new test for three years now, and the results have been extremely predictable. Barely anybody is passing, and students are falling behind. Oh, that's right, looks like that conflicts with the GENIUS No Child Left Behind Program. Wow, another flaw in the American education system? I am relieved that I am in eleventh grade, and will never again see this failure of a test. However, I still have to live with the consequences. I cannot wait to see my brother's discouraged face as he comes home from taking this test. I cannot wait to console him and tell him that he's not &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot;. The American education system is.

The way to classify is by observing how all the numbers simply end in zero, not giving it self a great value in significant place figures. By this means, teachers and students can argue for days on how unaccurate these measurements are.<b>&nbsp;</b>This proves why Jose's point is unvalid in math terms.&nbsp;</p> <p>Another reason to say this is because you cant just based your point of view on a single graph, you need further research to say this is a valid point of all 16 year olds are the safest teenage drivers. You can take small surverys, polls around the nation and yet you will not have the accurate measurement of the safest age range for drivers. As time keeps on going, things keep on changing without the control of one's hands, and how terrifying that may seem to some,its the truth. There is no way in the world, up to this point and maybe even for another couple of centuries that we will know for sure that any graph or mathematical equation is trully correct. We has humans have evolved a great amount of knowledgement and communications but its all inventions of a brain that we will aren't aware on how much more its capacity is. Numbers as well as time, is something that we have invented to create a better daily life for every indivdual, yet people can fight we can be completely wrong since math isnt a for sure thing. This is another point to why the claim is incorrect.</p> <p>Last but not least, everyone is different in the world, we may all have our own point of views but there is to some extend where people thatare &quot;educated&quot; should correct on another. It's sad to live in a world full of people unaware of the challeges, the accidents and the possiblites onwe may have in the big nation we live in.

I was terrified, it looked like a human with big wings, almost like an angel, I followed the shadow and hear a thud and then smoke come up from the ground.

In order to see which age has the least number of accidents, you must take into account the number of licensed drivers. When you look at that, you see that indeed 16 year olds have a high ratio of accidents. However, he is correct in saying that 16 year olds are the safest because they are the most mature and the best drivers in terms of skill. From what I see, the 16 year olds at my school have the strongest biceps and are the most able to defend themselves when an attacker comes at them, this means that they are able to have a lot of focus and are able to drive better. When you become 17 years old, you start to get bullied a lot and this leads to distraction and depression, people older than 17 who experience bullying will become sad and it may lead to more accidents and more reckless driving. If you have a friend who is over 17 and is feeling depressed or bullied, they should definitely call the bullying hotline at 1800-633-3333. There they will be able to get proffesional help and be able to overcome their sadness and stand up to face the bullies who rob them of hope, happiness and future. If you are 16 years old, you will not experience bullying because you will have large muscles to fend them off. For example, Jaewon has the largest biceps in the city and nobody dares to bully him. When they try to bully him, all he has to do is flex his biceps and they are intimidated and scared away.</p>",4045,5457,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,

Instead they clicked random answers or just went right through the tests. I do not believe they have done this out of blatant disrespect or because they do not feel prepared. I believe they have done this because of the timing of the testing. We are at the end of the school year, and many teachers are looking to cram in the last bits of material they need to finish teaching before the exams. The testing has broken up schedules and has caused many students, including myself, to miss vital material for the end of the year exams. This upsets both students and teachers, adding to the stress on everyone at this already stressful time.

In my opinion, Jose is right. The lowest number of accidents is 624,000, which is held by licensed drivers who are 16 years of age. I agree with Jose because a 16 year old driver is almost forced to drive in the safest conditions possible. For example, a licensed driver whom is about 16 years of age, is more likely to be in the care of their parents. Good parents make sure that their child is safe at all costs. This entails restriction on numbers of passengers, if you will have a car of your own or share with the family, how and when to watch your speed, and ultimately, how to drive defensively.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are a licensed driver over the age of 16 however, you are slightly more dependent which can have a large effect on how safe your driving. For example, I am currently 17 years old. When I was 16, I listened to exactly what I was told to do by my grandfather. My grandfather was my driving instructor at home after I finished driver's education.When I turned 17 on the other hand, I was allowed to make more independent decisions to develop a new level of comfort in my driving.

While it is true that 16 year olds have the least number of accident, the probability of an individual (that is 16 years of age) getting into an accident is higher than that of a 17, 18, or 19 year old individual. There are 1,643,000 licensed 16 year old drivers, and out of that total number of drivers there were 624,000 accidents. The ratio of accidents:drivers is 624,000/1,643,000 which equals a 0.38 probability. The same ratio for 17 year olds is 680,000/2,209,000=0.31, for 18 year olds 720,000/2,537,000=0.28, and for 19 year olds 670,000/2,653,000=0.25. 16 year olds have the higheset accident:number of drivers ratio, and therefor the highest probability of getting in an accident, in relation to their respective total number of accidents and drivers.

The tabel average is 673,500, but 16 year olds only cause 624,000. According to the average and the chart, 18 year olds are the bigger threat. My second reason for agreeing with Jose is that when a person first gets their license they are cautious. They take and apply everything they just learned from drivers ed and drive that way on the road. Ironically, this group of people are the 16 year olds because they just met the age requirement to get their license. It is not until after about a year of driving that a person becomes comfortable and then lacks in safety.

Also, since 16 is the minimum age that a person can receive their drivers license, they don't have nearly as much of experience as people who have been driving for a while already like the 19 year old in the chart above. Another point would be that if you notice the numbers of how many people at that certain age have their license, you will notice that the each age the number goes up more and there is a 575,000 difference between the least and the second to least which would be 16 and 17 year old.&nbsp;</p>",5458,4113,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,

Probability of each age group looks like so:</p> <p>Probability = (Number of accidents)/(Number of licensed drivers)</p> <p>16 years old - 0.38</p> <p>17 years old - 0.31</p> <p>18 years old - 0.28</p> <p>19 years old - 0.25</p> <p>So, this data shows that 16 years olds are actually not the safest teenage drivers; they are the least safe. As age increases, the probability of an accident decreases. From 16 to 17 year olds, there is a huge jump in the probability of accidents. 16 years olds are 7 percent more likely to get into an accident than 17 year old drivers.

There needs to be a percentage rate since the more registered drivers there are, there are more recorded accidents. Calculating the percentage rate of accidents among teenage drivers by dividing the number of licensed drivers from the number of accidents and multiplying by 100. The calculations are as follows rounded to the nearest hundreth: 38.9% of 16 year old drivers were in an accident, 30.78% of 17 year old drivers were in an accident, 28.38% of 18 year old drivers were in an accident, and 25.25% of 19 year olds were in an accident.

Also in the chart we see that numbers of licensed drivers of 16-years-old have a lower amount of people receiving their licensed than as how 17,18, and 17 years old have more than 2 million of ppeople sustaining a driver's license. Having less number of licensed drivers decreases the amount of number of accidents. There is also other reasons why 16 years old drivers are more cautious about driving than the other ages. 16 years old try to follow the laws and are slower drivers because they are beginners that are not really sure how hard it is to drive when older people are driving much faster. They are also scared because having a car and your license makes a person much more responsible.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,11319157,11,12328549,"<p>I disagree with Jose. While the table does show, the 16 year old drivers have less accidents then the 17, 18, and 19 year olds, there are also less 16 year old lisenced drivers. 1,634,00 is about or less then half of the number of 17, 18, and 19 year olds on the road. The number of accidents caused by 16 year old drivers is not half of the number of accidents casued by older drivers.

VALIDATION,A,N,N,F,1112154,11,12328117,"<p>I disagree with Jose because there is a huge difference between the number of licensed drivers between ages sixteen and nineteen.

VALIDATION,B,N,N,F,1114632,11,12328119,"<p>In a sense, Jose may be correct. When you look at statistics and other things of that sort, you see that teenage drivers are the ones who are affected the most due to accidents and other things of that sort. When you look at the chart above, you see that the numbers of drivers increase, and so does the number of accidents. When drivers are sixteen years old, the number of accidents are not as high. This may be due to the fact that teens have just obtained a license or permit and want to drive as safe as possible. Knowing me, I would definitely not want to get my permit or license taken away because of reckless driving, Now don't get me wrong, some sixteen year olds could care less about how they drive (those are the 624,000 sixteen year olds who make up the number of accidents in this age group every year). Now, when you look at the age group from seventeen to eighteen, you would think that the average number of accidents would have increased dramatically. This is definitely not the case, the older they got...the more reckless they got. But, you always have to take other things into consideration like the fact that the number of licensed drivers goes up, and so do the numbers of accidents (only by 66,000 drivers). The number of drivers had increased, by about 500,000 drivers...so when you compare 66,000 accidents to 500,000 drivers...ir's not as bad as the other statistics. Now when you look at 19 year olds, you see that they start to mature...and driving becomes second hand to them, and they are able to avoid peoplewho do not drive as well as them. So, to answer this question...I do not believe that sixteen year olds are the safest drivers are the safest drivers...I believe abyone past 19 years of age are the safest drivers.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,H,N,N,M,1114781,11,12328118,<p>I disagree with jose because if you look at the stats the percentage of 16 year old drivers is almost half of that of the other ages.Yet these drivers have almost the same amount of accidents of all of the other drivers.Using this logic you can assume that the 16 year old drivers are the drivers are the most that make the most mistakes and have the most accidents.</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Around 38% of 16 year old drivers undergo accidents according to the table, Which is far greater then the 31% of 17 year olds, the 28% of 18 year olds and the 25% of 19 year olds. Putting this in perspective, the rise in percentage among the age implies a formula that rises in accidents per driver as ones age increases.

I don't agree with his claim that 16-year-olds are the safest teenage drivers because they have a least number of accidents. 16-year- olds that are licensed driver make up about 1,634,000 according to the graph and they have fewer accidents. But if you look at the graph the number of licensed drivers in older ages they have more people driving. And their number of accidents kind of level up to about the same number. If you divide the number of licensed drivers with the number of accidents it gives you sort of a percent. For 16-year-olds it was 2.62 and for 17-year olds it was 3.25, for 18-year olds it was 3.52, and for 19-year olds it was 3.95. Overall they are pretty close to one another.

Yet when you compare the number of accidents they have 624,000 which is about the same as the others. The percentage of 16 year olds would be higher then the rest. They have about 600000 less than the closest person next to them. The least number of accidents doesn't even matter. You have to break down and solve the numbers. The number of licensed drives at age 19 is 26530000 which is a million more then any. Yet there number of accidents is less then 18 year olds. The difference is only 46 thousand between 16 and 19. I would have to say that 19 year old and 18 year olds would be the higher numbers of all of them totaled togheter. 16 year olds also would be the highest because the number of licensed drivers compared to the other is less and the accidents is in the same range about.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, they have less accidents, but that is only because they are being cautious with these new laws they have learned. By the time they reach the age of 17 or 18, which is the age when most accidents are occurring, they feel comfortable enough with the rules they begin to get lazy or overconfident in their driving ability, thus they make wrong decisions and cause accidents.

Even though the total number of accidents of sixteen-year-olds is far below any other age group, his assumption is false. Comparing the numbers of accidents to the number of licensed drivers allows one to understand the ratio of accidents based on an age group. The date was constructed by using the number of licensed drivers of an age group and dividing that number by the corresponding number of accidents of drivers in that age group. This data allows one to study the amount of people in a ratio to the number of accidents. For example, the number of sixteen-year-old licensed drivers, 1,634,000, is divided by the number of accidents of sixteen-year-olds, 624,000. Based off of this calculation for ever 2.6 sixteen-year-olds there is one accident. The same formula was used to find the ratio for the other age groups: 3.24 seventeen-year-olds per one accident; 3.52 eighteen-year-olds per one accident; and 3.96 nineteen-year-olds per one accident.

While it is true that they do have the least number of accidents, in comparison with the number of licensed drivers they actually have the highest percentage of accidents. In alliance with the number of licensed drivers, the number of accidents for 16 year olds is 32%. Among the following three ages, the percentage gradullat drops.

If you were to make proportions you would find that for approxametely 1 accident occurs for every 3, 16 year old drivers, where 1 accident occurs for every 4, 19 year old drivers, showing that more 16 year old drivers are gettting in accidents, making them not the safest drivers.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jus because you have not had an accident does not mean you are the safest driver. Anything can happen on the road at anytime without seeing it coming. The most experienced driver who has not had an accident could end up in one at anytime on the road. You could be a professional driver such as a racecare driver and still get into accidents or even cause one. As long as you have road smarts and follow the laws there should be no accidents.</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Learning these kind of things take time to learn and I yet need to know.&nbsp; I believe that it is more important to learn to drive at age 16 then where I am at. That way we are safe from violece like rapers and other violece in the streets. When someone is in their car they are more safe than someone being out in the wild with the animals that can kill us.

One, it could show that 16-year-old are reducing the amount of accidents over the course of year. Or, it could show that the number of accidents are increasing of the course of years.
