This says, &quot; To keep the soil on the chinampas fertile, the farmers spead fresh mud from the lake over their gardens.... Thanks to this treatment, the soil on the chinampas was so rich that farmers could grow up to seven crops each year.&quot; This example shows how the Aztecs wanted to keep their crops fresh and healthy to eat. By spreading mud from the lake, they kept the soil nice and fertile so they could keep growing crops year after year. The last example in source #2 is in the Preparing Food section. This section states, &quot; The Aztecs ate mostly fresh food, which they brought in the markets every day. They also preserved food to keep it from spoiling.&quot; This shows by keeping the food preserved, it will maintain it's freshness and not spoil.

It also says how Maize is the basic element of every meal, and how sometimes it is eaten in the form of corn on the cob, but usally is dried ,ground into flour , and made into tortillas. So if Maize is the basic element of every meal then it was probablly good for the Aztecs to eat, considering it was practically eaten at every meal. So my third deatail that suppors how Aztecs ate very well is when it states in source three is when it say that if you were to visit Mexico City today you would still be able to expierence the last living example of Aztec history. Another detail is that you could climb abord on a brightly painted flat bottomed boat and take a trip on the canals and flow through the 50 square miles of floating gardens known a chinampas. So as you can see this detail shows how the Astect's had 50 square miles of garden where they grew all of their food and plants such as vegestables like corn on the cob and friut like tamatos and where they grew their Maize with is the basic element of every meal for Aztecs.

They drank alchohol too, but their favorite drink was choclatl, which was a spicy hot chocolate. If the Aztecs did not enjoy a good diet, then they wouldn't have had to preserve because they would eat it before then and wouldn't have fancy drinks like hot chocolate or Octli.
