So, I need 2 booths for crafts. If I multiply 7 over 1 by 15 over 2, I get the area of one craft booth. That area is 52 and 1 half. Now, if I multiply that by 2, I get 105 square feet. I also need to get a doubled area from the food booths. If I multiply 7 over 1 by 19 over 2, I get 66 and 1 half. Next, I multiply that area by 2, and my answer is 133 square feet. Finally, I add the two areas together and get 238 square feet. I look at Section F, and the length and width is 17 by 14. If I multiply these two numbers, I end up with 238 square feet.

VALIDATION,H,N,N,F,7577186,5,12328867,"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kayla is incorrect. She is incorrect because the first step you need to take is to find the area of Section F. Section F is 17 by 14 so you'll have to do 17 times 14 which equals 238. Then, you have to take the length and the width of the craft booth and multiply them. The length and the width of the craft booth is 7 by 7 1/2 so, when you multiply them, the answer is 52 1/2. After finding the answer, you need to double it because there needs to be 2 of that booth. Once you double it, it will come out as 105. Do the same thing to the length and the width of the food booth. Go through that process again with 7 by 9 1/2(food booth) and it will come out as 133 once you double 66&nbsp; 1/2(the answer to 9 times 9 1/2). If you add 133 square feet and 105 square feet, it will come out as 238 square feet which means it will fill in all of the space Section F has to offer(238 square feet).
