A 45-45-90 triangle needs two things: it's angles to be 45-45-90 in value and to be an isosoles triangle (two sides are equal in length). First we look at the angles of this diagram. Since the two trapezoids are congruent we can see that all the angles will be proportionate so we can just look at the top trapezoid to anaylze. Then we can compare the angles. We have a striaght line on the right side of this diagram. This striaght line equals 180 degrees. So all the componets must add up to 180 degrees. So we tak ethe 67 and 90 degrees and add them together. then with this value of 157. When we subtract this value from 180 we get the angle of the A, which is 27 degrees. So since one angle does not equal 45 degrees the others will not. Also we must look at the sides. In a 45-45-90 two sides must be equal. When we look at the sides we have to find that two of its sides are equal but the varibles on these triangles aren't the same.

As one can see on the outside of the trapezoid there is a 67 degree angle and the angle is on a straight line. So the angle on the line that is crossing through the flat line must be whatever 180-67 is which the answer to that is 113 degrees.

What doesn't need to occupy this land is wolves. I don't know if the recent induction of wolves are doing what they were supposed to do or not, but I do know that last summer my dad's horse, Sally, broke her leg after going through a fence. Sally was a gentle, kind horse. My dad took her on many trips to the headwaters in Colorado, out to the dessert behind our house, and to cattle drives in Montepeliar. She hardly ever spooked but when she did, it was because something was pursuing her. I watched her flip out after seeing a snake on the trail and I believe that's what happened when she ran through the fence. However, instead of a measly garden snake, the predator this time was a wolf. Sally's tragic death is not the only encounter we had with the elusive wolves last summer. When my brother was changing water he saw tracks which could only be described as wolves. If you are interested in seeing the pictures we still have them. In a different pasture my grandpa's horse got &quot;scratched&quot; on the rump so deeply that we had to take him to the vet for medication. Just as Sally, he was also trying to go through a fence. Why would a horse go through a barbed wire fence? There are plenty of reasonable answers, but I know that it was a wolf. These are just a handful of events involving wolves. I KNOW there are more than just handful out there though.</p> <p>So, there are no 45, -45, 90 triangles in this diagram, but if the wolf population continues to rise, then farmers incomes will go down 90%.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
