If you put the larger games first, you could fit the smaller games in beacause they are small. If you put the smaller games in first, you would risk the bigger &nbsp;ones not fitting. For example, if you put one of the smaller booths in section B and another one in section A, you would not be able to fit a bigger booth.I know this because since Section A has an area of 119 square feet, subtract food's booth area which is 66.5 square feet, and you get only 52.5 square feet left for section A. Since section B has a width of 14 ft and a length of 17 ft, it has an area of 238 square feet. Subtract the area of small games, which is 59.5 square feet, and you get 173.5 square feet left. In between the two sections the area would be 235 square feet left. That would make A large games booth not fit there. That would mean it would be short of a Large Games booth. The main reason that you must put the larger booths first is that the other booths won't fit.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Since section B, G, and C have an area of 238 square feet, all of them would be great choices for a Large Game area which also has 238 square feet.

The mistake James is that the crafts and food booth will be to huge. The booths <u>can not overlap other booths and cannot be blocking the walkway, too</u>. The equation is, (7X7 1/2 X 2) + (7X9 1/2 X 2) =?. First step to do is to times the seven by seven and a half to find the area of food which equals 52 and a half. (52 1/2) Then, you will times it by two which will get you one hundred five. (105) Next, you need to find the area of crafts. To do that, you need to times seven by nine and a half which should equal sixty-five and a half. (65 1/2) Then, you times sixty-five and a half by two and get one hundred thirty-one. (131) You have to add them up together and get two hundred thirty-six. (236) You have to divide it by two because each need at least two booths and get one hundred eighteen. (118) After that, times the length and width of Large Games. (14X17X3) When done you get two hundred thirty-eight. (238) Then divide them by three and get seventy-nine and one-third. (79 1/3) But, it has to be and equal number which we round up to eighty. (80)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, there are also three booths for the Large Games to be placed in the School Fair, too. Since the area of Large Games are 14 in length and 17 in width, the sections can be Section B, C, and G. Why? Because mostly each section is almost the EXACT same length and width as in Large Games. The length for Large games is 17 ft exactly like Section B, C, and G. They also have the same width, which is 14ft., too. They both have the EXACT same area which can fit in perfectly. (The area is two hundred thirty-eight feet by the way.) Section F is also an option, too. Well, why not Section A, D, E, and H? The length is the same thing, but not the width, seven ft..

TRAINING,H,N,N,M,7694326,5,10232410,<p>I agree with James because all booths need alot of space and so if they have the most space you might overlap the hallway and the area of section c is 238 if multiplied. And the area for large games is 438 so you would probably need two large sections or maybe three sections it would be better to just place the crafts and food booths instead of the large games booth. but it would be bad for he crafts and food because large games need more sections to place but its just one activity to just play a large game and the crafts and food is multiple activities. So I agree with James because the area for crafts and food is the same area for section so it would be perfect. but there is 2 more booths instead of just one big game area so 2 is more activities than one so it would be better to place crafts and food booths.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,2145,109,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,

So there for the larger ones should go in sections B, C,F, or G. Because if we placed the craft and food booth in one of the larger ones there would be no sections big enough for the larger booths. The craft and food are not one of the larger booths so they could go in one of the smaller ones like sections E,H,A or D. Another thing that could go wrong by placing the craft booth and the food booth down first is that, if we use all of the larger sections the larger booths may have to go into the cornor and have a small section where everyone would be cramped to go to there. If it's the biggest booth than it probably is very popular, so it shouldn't be shoved into the cornor in a small section. But on the other hand we might be able to put all of the food booths and craft booths into one of the larger sections to save some of the smaller for the smaller games. And we would still have 3 larger sections for the larger booths.

The gym sections A, E, D, and H all share the smae area of119 feet. The remaining gym sections (B, F, C, and G) all had the area of 238 feet.
