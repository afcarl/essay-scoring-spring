Drivers who are 19 have been driving for about 3 years and have had the experience of the road a lot more than the younger ones and believe they have become experienced drivers.

For 17 year olds, 18 year olds and 19 year olds, the numbers are 31.98%, 29.19%, and 25.25%, respectively. This means that Franklin's thought is actually the complete opposite of what he originally thought.

Because the numbers are lower, that does seem to lead to thinking that they are safer drivers, but really they're probably just being cautious because they're going to be looked out for more on the road than the older drivers. The older drivers, however, are more experienced, so they get cocky and don't pay as much attention, and therefore can get into more accidents. And also, the amount of 16 year olds is much smaller than the 19 year olds; almost by half. The accident numbers are only different by about 100,000. So proportionally, it works; less people that age driving, less accidents. So in that sense, I would not say that they are safer drivers.</p>",5527,4428,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,

For axample, many 16 years old, depending on state, only have a driver's permit, not license. To obtain a driver's permit, one must take a course of driver's ed, get a pink slip, and finally take a written test. With a driving permit, there are many restrictions on when and how a person can drive. First of all, you must have six hours of driving lessons from and instuctor, and two of those hours must be at night. Also, when you practice driving, you must drive with an adult 25 years of age or older, and you must only drive at certain times, day or night. In addition to that, with a permit, you must complete 6 months of practice driving, with 50 hours in the day and 10 at night with an adult 25 years of age or older. Once someone gets their license, maybe even after your 16th birthday, you cannot drive with other passengers in the car unless they are 20 years or older until you have had your license for a year. As for siblings, you must have a written and signed note from your parents in order to take them anywhere.

I say it is what your intentions are. If oneself wants to look &quot;cool&quot; while operating a moving vehicle then they better think again, or what the heck go ahead and do something stupid.

My evidence supporting this is that if you increase the amount of 16 year old drivers to that of a 17 year old, you'd see that there would be more 16 year old drivers getting into accidents than 17 year olds.

TRAINING,W,N,N,M,204770,11,10226728,"<p>I disagree with Frank. Frank claims that 16-year-olds are the safest teenage drivers, because they have the least number of accidents. Frank does not take into account the fact that the 16 year olds also have the least amount of liscensed drivers on the road. Assuming that the amount of drivers on the road correlates closely with the Number of Licensed Drivers, 16 year olds are the fewest on the roads while 19 year olds are the most common on the roads. If one were to look at the ratio of drivers vs the amount of accidents, one would find that the 19 year olds are actually the safest teenage drivers, because they have the lowest accident rate. The accident rate better describes driver safety, as it shows a ratio, rather than a flat number of people, which Frank bases his assumption off of. By comparing ratios, one sees that the 16 year olds have an accident/license ratio of .36 (the highest), 17 year olds have a .32, 18 year olds have a .2919, and 19 year olds have a ratio of .25254 (the lowest rate). By observing the ratio of licensed drivers to the amount of accidents, one would find that the 19 year old age group is actually the safest group, and the 16 year olds are actually the most accident prone. I have to disagree with Frank, based off of this information. Franks statement would have been viable if each age group had the same amount of licensed drivers, though this is not the case. Since there is a different amount of drivers per age group, you must base your statements accordingly, and look at ratios, rather than comparing based off flat accident numbers.</p>",5456,2851,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,

Therefore, 16 year olds actually are the most dangerous teenage drivers.</p>",4045,5458,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,

Older teen drivers get lazy &nbsp;and use less awareness of how dangerous driving a car is, especially not obeying &nbsp;the laws put there to protect them. New inexperienced drivers still have a sense of fear when driving. Older more experienced driver who have not experienced any crashes don't believe they're in any danger while on the road. Most teens today believe that they are invincible and nothing bad can happen to them. But adults know that's not true.

My reasoning behind this is that the statistics are simply invalid, and adults have more experience with driving so they have more experience to learn from.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 16 year olds have the least percentage in their group licensed. It is only logical that they would not get into accidents. They are the smallest. if you look at the numbers, of the majority of drivers, the group of 16 year olds have alicense average of 1,578,000. This is a much smaller statistic compared to the 19 year olds whom average 2,653,000. Due to the shortage of drivers, they can't cause accidents due to not being out as much. Just because they have fewer accidents, doesn't mean they're safer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second reason as to why 16 year olds are not the safest is that the maturity and responsibility level of people increases with age. When teenagers get their licenses, it gives them a sense of accomplishment that clouds their mind and allows them to give an idea that they can do anything. This makes the average driver careless in their driving habits and. most often or not will cause an accident. As people grow up, they understand the responsibilities of driving and take a much safer approach.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, teenagers at the age of 16 are not the safest drivers on the road. Due to the lack of drivers and maturity, they simply can't drive as safely as adults do.

Therefore just having the least amount of accidents doesnt make it the safest group, but what is important is the rational amount or the percentage of those accident . Also the number of accidents can have a direct correlation with the number of drivers, as the 16 year old driver group has much less licensed drivers than the rest. I got percentages for each age group and realized this same inference. I did this by dividing the amount of licensed drivers to the amount of accidents and moving the decimal to the hundreths (2 places to the rigth ) place as if guetting a percentage . Since a percentage is a total from 100 this would mean that the total&nbsp; I would get would mean the amount of accidents per every driver. In the 16 year old groups per every hundred drivers there are about 3 accidents (2.72 rounded ) And this total is much larger compared in ratio to the other groups, which had totals of</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>17 year olds : 3 accidents per driver</p> <p>18 year olds : 3 accidents per driver</p> <p>19 year olds : 4 accidents per driver</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But we should keep in mind that what matters is the amount of&nbsp; drivers relatively to t he amount of accidents.</p>",2890,4428,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,

However, I think that this may be a true statement only because when you are 16 you have just gotten your license which means you cannot drive people around. Knowing this, it means that you have less distractions, and the fact that you are still learning how to drive means that you would probably be more careful and cautious as well. The older drivers on the other hand feel that just because they are older they have more experience and can drive more recklessly, unfortunately. Also, some of the restrictions about passengers get restricted when you have had your license for long enough which means the driver and his/her friends have more of a chance of goofing off while in the vehicle which is more dangerous and can cause more crashes.&nbsp; In addition, parents who have young children like 16 year olds who just got their license want to keep an eye on their child when they first start to drive. They are constantly on the child's back looking over for him/her so that they don't get hurt. This could also play a part in why 16 year olds are safer drivers.</p>",4045,5458,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,

This data should also include how long the individuals have been driving for to evaluate how safe these drivers really are. It would make since for the people who have been on the road less have had less chance to be in an accident. For example if a 16 year old has been driving for 3 months he is much less likely to have been in an accident than a 19 year old who has been driving for 3 years.</p>,2851,5456,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,

Franks chart called tabel one is reaserch that he did to prove his clame first he did long reserch on this topic and he looked on relibel sorse to get his info on his data tabel to prove his clame that 16 year old drivers are safer and better drivers then the older generation</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Franks data table is relibel and shose the evedince of his clam. it seese that on his data&nbsp; tabel it sees tha 16 year olds in 2010 1,578,000 are lised and are eligabel to drive an 580,000 of those kid are in acidents. so 580,000 out of 1,578,000 kids got in in an accident well driveing in 2010that is one out of three kide that year witch is pretty low compared to older drives</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17 year old there are 2,195,000 drivers that are eligabel to drive and 702,000 of those kids cased or ar in an accident in 2010 the averge of 17 yearols is two out of tree driverd were in&nbsp; an acident. 18 year old there are 2,432,000 young adolts that have there licened and are eligubel to drive and 710,000 of those kids cased and or in an accident. that nuber is two out of thre. 19 year old theres no real difrence ether they have the safe estumation rate as the 17 year old kid drivers an up</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just becesue they are older and more experesed dosent mean there are safer driver the evedece is clerely provein in my summery of Franks therey. the olnly resone older kids are not as safe of driver as young people is becuse they of done it for a awile and stop paying as much atation as young drivrs. They become more reclese with there driveing and arnt as carfel as young drivers are. when you first get your lisens your carfel and it is a proven fact they dont want to get hurt or lose there brand new lisens after they got it so they are more careful about htere driveing.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so this come to my conclsen yes i thikn frank is right that younger drivers are more safe drivers then older kids and young adolts becuse there are not as reclse Frank has proven his clam with relibel reserch that is verey acret for the time, so yes france there is corect.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",5504,4428,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,
TRAINING,W,N,N,F,5841482,11,10230146,"<p>Frank claims that 16-year old drivers are the safest teenage drivers, because they have the fewest number of accidents, I on the other hand do not agree with Frank. Yes 16-year-old driver do have the fewest number of accidents, but they also have the fewest number of drivers. The 16-year-old drivers have out of 1,578,000 of them, 36.36% of them are getting into accidents. For the 17-year-olds only 31.98% are getting into accidents, 29.19% of the 18-year-olds, and 25.25% of the 19-year-olds. Also the number of 16-year-olds not getting into accidents is much lower than the other teenage drivers. 998,000 of 16-year-old drivers are not getting into accidents compared to the other drivers; 17-year-olds 1,493,000, 18-year-olds 1,722,000, and 19-year-olds 1,983,000. So in conclusion, I do not agree with Franks statement: that 16-year-old drivers are the safest because they get in the fewest number of accidents. I believe that 19-year-old drivers are the safest in that only 25.25% of them are getting into to accidents. Another reason why I think that 19-year-old drivers are more likely to not get into an accident, is because they have more experience in years than a 16-year-old driver might have.</p>",5527,5455,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,
TRAINING,W,N,N,M,5841524,11,10230170,"<p>I Disagree with Frank because even though they have the least number of accidents, they have less experience and can get into more accidents on roads that they do not know. 19 year old drivers have more accidents, but I feel they know what to not do next time.

TRAINING,W,N,N,M,5841566,11,10230182,"<p>I disagree with Frank because 16-year-olds aren't the safest drivers they are actually the most dangerous driver that are listed in this chart. In my calculations I found that not 16-year-olds were the safest driver but rather 19-year-olds were the safest drivers. To find this I took the number of accidents divided by the number of drivers. I then multiplied this by 100 to find a percentage. For 16-year-olds, 38% of them had had some form of an accident while 17-year-olds had a 32% rate of accidents. The 18-year-olds had a 29% accident rate then followed by the 19-year-olds who had a 25% accident rate. Overall, thee are still not the best accident rate numbers but I disagree with Frank because even though the 16-year-olds had the lowest number of accidents (580,000 accidents), their population is also the smallest out of the four groups (1,578,000) causing for a higher rate in accident among the population. The smaller population may be due to not a majority of 16-year-olds having their licenses. The 19-year-olds were actually the safest drivers because the had the largest population of 2,653,000 but the second lowest accident rate (670,000). I disagree with Frank's statement because even though the 16-year-olds have the lowest amounts of accident, their population is also much smaller and their accident rate is 38%, the 19-year-olds are in fact the safest drivers surveyed.</p>",2851,5504,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,

To disagree with Frank would be the answer of choice due to the fact that the highest percentage of drivers involved in an accident reside in the age bracket of sixteen. A surprising 36.7% of sixteen years old drivers have been involved in some type of accident (which is over one in every three) whereas the seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen years old have an accident percentage of 31.7%, 29.2%, and 25.3% respectively. The provided calculation data shows that, in fact, nineteen years old drivers are the safest of the four, and sixteen years old drivers are the most dangerous. Frank is not only incorrect in his assumption, but he is the farthest thing from correct due to the fact that from least safe to safest counts up (sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen) based on his table.</p>",5454,5455,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,
TRAINING,W,N,N,F,5841776,11,10230194,"<p>I disagree with Frank's conclusion that 16-year-olds are the safest teenage drivers. The number of accidents compared to the number of licensed drivers is a larger ratio than that of the older years. As the drivers got older, their accident rates decreased in comparison to the number of people getting their license. At first glance, it may appear that the 16-year-olds are the safest because the number of accidents is smaller than that of the older ones, but if the chart is analyzed the results come out much differentley.</p>",5527,2851,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,

TRAINING,A,N,N,M,3964074,11,10228687,"<p>I highly disagree. Just because 16 years old teens had the fewest number of accidents does not mean that they are the safest teenage drivers. Take note that in Nevada, you have to be 16 in order to recieve a driver's license. Although teens of that age are a bit more careful, they'll still have the audacity to cause an accident. Hence, texting while driving, speeding, not paying attention, etc. I know this because I know several teens that do so. Young teens are really eager to drive, knowing that they can have the freedom of going anywhere they wants without having to walk. As teens get older however, they become more anxious to get to places, which can lead from speeding to an accident. Notice that teens from 17-18 years old have a lot of accidents caused. Well, the older we get, the more impatient we've become. Although once we've reached the certain age to realize that our lives value more than anything else, we've become more cautious of what we do. Notice that there are 2,653,000 drivers at the age of 19, and only 670,000 accidents have only occured by them. That's a 1,983,000 difference by drivers and accidents. That's a 1,983,000 lives saved due to safe driving. Only cause we value are lives, and not by some ticket.</p>",5504,5456,1454,,,0,1,0,,,,,,,

This was my finding;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>16-year-old drivers: &nbsp;</p>  <br>Number of licensed drivers: 1,578,000 <br>Number of accidents: 580,000 <br>580000/1578000=.37 or 37%  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>17-year-old drivers:</p>  <br>Number of&nbsp; licensed drivers: 2,195,000 <br>Number of accidents: 702,000 <br>702000/2195000=.32 or 32%  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>18-year-old drivers:</p>  <br>Number of licensed Drivers: 2,432,000 <br>Number of accidents: 710,000 <br>710000/2432000=.29 or 29%  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>19-year-old drivers:</p>  <br>Number of licensed drivers: 2,653,000 <br>Number of accidents: 670,000 <br>670000/2653000=.25 or 25%  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By looking at the data in the form of percents, we can see that Frank's clam does not hold any water. 16-year-old drivers have more accidents in ratio to the amont of teens who are driving; showing that they are not the safest teen drivers. They are in fact the most dangerous group of drivers. Looking at the data the older the driver is the less the percntage of them having an accident is. 19-year-old drivers are the least likely to have an accident at 25%. That is still a high percentage of drivers but it is not nearly as high as 16-year-old drivers at 37%.</p>",5455,5456,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,

VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,2355455,11,12331233,"<p>I agree and disagree with Frank's statement. I agree because teen drivers have recently learned the information which means they are more likely to remember it on the road. The rules seem fairly new to them and are more likely to follow them since they don't have as much experience driving. Also, teens should be driving by themselves which means if something happens, it affects one person, not multiple.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Teenagers can also be some of the unsafest drivers around. I have been to classes about driving safely on the road and rules to abide by. I have seen a video with some guys in the car and decide it would be funny to slam the door on a guy trying to get in. They do so and roll right over him. Also, at this age, teenagers want to look cool and powerful as well. They think the way to show this is by driving extremely fast. Some people I have talked to say they drive 90 mph on the highway. I asked why and they said, &quot;Because I want to.&quot; Driving way over the speed limit can increase your chances of getting hit, but you can also hurt other people. By not following the rules of the road, you could hit someone else and devastating consequences can occur. When they drive too fast, they lose control of the car, spin around and run into someone and can't stop their vehicle. Teens also decide to think they are all that and text and drive, which is extremely dangerous. Things can happen on the road when you are not looking. They don't know when the light will change and there are possibilities for accidents or collisions. Peer pressure can also make teens unsafe drivers. If they want to have some &quot;fun,&quot; others will encourage the driver so go faster and speed on the acceleration. I heard a story about this one teenager who was a great student, on the football team, and a fantastic kid. One night he made a stupid decision that would change his life forever. He got into his car and drove some of his friends to a party. His friends wanted him to go faster, and he knew it was wrong. But this kid went ahead and did so, which got them in an accident. Everyone survived but the driver. It is so important to make your own decisions and not conform to peer pressure no matter what anyone says.&nbsp;Mostly, I disagree with Frank because also media shows these scenarios with peope texting and driving, which makes people think it is acceptable and safe.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,2355376,11,12331234,"<p>I do not agree with Franks statement because although 16 year old's have the fewest number of accidents, they also have a significantly lower number of licensed drivers. For 17, 18, and 19 year old's there are well over 2 million licensed drivers and around 700,000 accidents but for 16 year old's there are only 1.5 million drivers and 580,000 accidents. The question asked is about the age group with the fewest accidents and for most people the fastest way to get the answer would be to look at the number of accidents and see which is lowest. In reality the number of licensed drivers greatly effects the number of accidents. If the number of licensed drivers at age 16 were the same or closer to the numbers at age 17, 18, or 19 than the data would show that the number of accidents were about doubled. Therefore the licensed drivers at 16 years old do not have the lowest amount of accidents.&nbsp;</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,A,N,N,F,2479462,11,12331258,"<p>I disagree with Frank's claim arguing that 16 years old are acutually are the safest teenage drivers. However, from the chart they have 580,000 fewest number of accidents than the other age of teenage drivers they also have less number of licensed drivers. This would be why there was less number of accidents. Many teenager gets ther licensed at the age of 17 years old and older.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,2481021,11,12331259,"<p>I agree with Frank that 16 year olds are safest becuase they have the fewest number of accidents.

VALIDATION,H,N,N,F,3713460,11,12331314,<p>I agree with Franks Statement that 16-year-olds are actually the safest teenage drivers because they have the fewest number of accidents. I used the data collected in Table 1 to reach my conclusion.</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,A,N,N,F,3713802,11,12331315,<p>I disagree with Frank because 36% of 16 year old drivers get into accidents. Frank says that they are the safest because they have the least number of accidents however they have the least amount of drivers. As they are older more of them get their license and the number of accidents decrease.</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,A,N,N,F,3717777,11,12331328,"<p>I disagree with Frank because 16 year olds maybe the one who has the least amount of accidents out of all the other teenage drivers but this is because they are new to driving so they are more careful than the experienced drivers and have less licensed drivers in that age. The data above shows that there are only 1,578,000 licensed drivers that are 16 years old while there are 2,195,000 17 year old drivers, 2,432,000 18 year olds, and 2,653,000 19 year old drivers. 17-19 years old have higher number of accidents than 16 year olds because there are more licensed drivers in that age group so there are more chances of them getting in an accident. Just because they have a higher number of accidents that doesn't mean that they're not safe drivers.&nbsp;</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,A,N,N,M,3720996,11,12331329,<p>I disagree with Frank. The reason for this is the number of accidents is low but so is there drivers. The have 1/3 of accidents for their drivers. While 19 year old drivers have 1/5 of accidents per driver. Lastly the age difference behind a wheel gives experience to a driver.</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VALIDATION,A,N,N,M,3730566,11,12331318,"<p>I'd agree because of the chart above, it states that the number of accidents that have occured by 16-year-olds is actually the smallest number shown out of the bunch while it says that 18-year-olds have the highest number.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,A,N,N,F,3730371,11,12331319,"<p>I disagree with Frank's decision because if you look at the percentage of accidents in comparison to the amount of drivers in the age category, you will find that although 16 year olds have the least amount of accidentsw, they also have the least amount of drivers. In turn this makes their accident percentage rate the highest at 36% while the lowest is 25% with 19 year olds.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,W,N,N,M,3733448,11,12331316,"<p>I completely disagree with Frank. Althought the number of accidencts is lowest for those of who are 16 years old, it doesn't neccessarily mean they are the safest. Compared with the number who are licensed, about 37% of teens get into accidents, which is signicficantly lower than the other age groups who boste small percentages such as 25% for the 19 year olds. The only reason the number of accidents for 16 year olds is lower is because their is a significant less licensed number of them. By comparing percentages, it can be seen that in fact, 16 year olds are the most dangerous.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,H,N,N,M,3709025,11,12331322,"<p>Frank claims that 16-year-olds are the safest drivers due to the lower amount of accidents. However, I disagree with Frank.

VALIDATION,A,N,N,M,4464678,11,12331356,"<p>I disagree because even though 16-year-olds have the least number of accidents, they also have the least number of licensed drivers, even if you find the average number of accidents per teen, seventeen year olds come close but it turns out that sixteen year olds still have the most number of accidents per driver.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VALIDATION,A,N,N,F,4470000,11,12331361,"<p>Well, according to the table 16-years old teenagers have the least amount of accidents. However, I firmly believe that is only the case because 16 is usually the age when a person can start driving, so 16-year olds have the pressure of proving that they are capable of driving thusly being a safer driver until they feel old enough, or when they feel as though they aren't invincible, to be more &quot;reckless.&quot;</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,A,N,N,F,4477691,11,12331363,"<p>I disagree with Frank because the number of accidents does not necessarily indicate whether one age group has safer drivers. 16 year olds in fact, according to the table, are more prone to accidents especially since they are more inexperienced. The average percentage of 16 year old drivers is higher than that of the other ages with a percentage of 36.76%.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VALIDATION,W,N,Y,M,4456121,11,12331360,"<p>Yes I do agree. This is because of the fear and precautions many new drivers dont want to loose their privelage to drive. Adult drivers are more prone to wreckless driving due to the thought of entitlment. Once people approve for a drivers license they develope the thought to do what ever they want since they have a drivers license.

VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,4492100,11,12331369,"<p>I agree with Frank. To reach the conclusion that 16 year olds are the safest teen drivers, divide the totaly number of licensed drivers by the total number of accidents. This will give a rough estimate of about how many accidents each driver will have. 16 year olds, on average, will have about 2 accidents. However, the number of accidents per diver increases with 17, 18, and 19 year olds to about 3 or 4 accidents per driver.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,5196100,11,12331384,"<p>I agree with Frank becuase,16 year olds only 2.7% rate of accidents in comparison to the rate of 3.1% of 17 yr old drivers. 18 yr olds have a rate of 3.4% while 19 year olds have a rate of 3.9%.

VALIDATION,A,N,N,F,5195590,11,12331385,"<p>I agree with Frank because the number of accidents are incredibly lower compare to the number of accidents of 17, 18 and 19 years old.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,A,N,N,M,5196112,11,12331387,"<p>No, I disagree with Frank because; accidents are just accidents. Accidents happen by chance and just being at the wrong place at the wrong time. That does not mean that they are more safe drivers.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,A,N,N,F,5195805,11,12331386,<p>I agree with Frank because the 16 year old drivers would be in their first stage of driving and would be very cautious rather than the more experienced 17+ age drivers who believe that they have a greater ability to drive. The percentage of 16 year old teens getting into an accident is the lowest and they would be the safest.</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,A,N,N,M,5197983,11,12331381,"<p>I disagree with Frank's argument because 16 years old drivers has the fewest number of accidents, and in the same time, it has the fewest number of licensed drivers. As a percentage, 36.8% of drivers got into accidents, 31.9% of 17 years of drivers got into accidents, 29.2% of 18 years old drivers got into accident, and 25.3% of 19 years old drivers got into accident.

VALIDATION,H,N,N,F,5203985,11,12331382,"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most teenagers believe that they are not a threat or very responsible to be driving. Although, statistics display that most 16 year-old drivers account one third of the accidents in their age group and 19 year-old drivers account less than one third in their age group, which is evidence of the maturity one has when growing up. I strongly diagree with Frank because many teenagers are lured to putting themselves in danger and risking the lives of others because of being distracted with objects or being under the influence.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,H,N,N,F,5185844,11,12331388,"<p>I agree with Frank due to the fact that 16 years old are required when having a license to have a 25 year or older person in the car with you at all times.

VALIDATION,A,N,N,M,436362,11,12331091,"<p>I agree with Frank's conclusion. I believe that 16 year olds are safe because when they recieve their license, they drive really safe to avoid getting tickets or into an accident. As drivers progresses with their experience in driving, they tend to speed and do reckless things, such as drifting. 18 years old is when most teens are seniors or freshman in college, thus they're exposed to drugs and alcohol. They probably drive home drunk or on drugs from parties. 19 years old is the same as they too are in college.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VALIDATION,A,N,N,F,436551,11,12331090,"<p>I disagree with Frank, because frankly, he is only looking at the numbers without considering the ratios. There is a big difference between a one in a million chance and a one in a thlousand chance, after all. Similarly, looking at the percentages of teen drivers involved in accidents can depict a more accurate version of the story. Taking the ratios into account, 36.76% of sixteen-year-olds are involved in accidents, as opposed to 25.25% of nineteen-year-olds. This means that sixteen-year-olds have a far greater chance of being involved in accidents and are thus the least safest drivers.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,A,N,N,F,436825,11,12331093,"<p>I agree with this statement because the number of teenage drivers in the age group of 16 is the fewest.

VALIDATION,A,N,N,M,437355,11,12331096,"<p>I disagree with Frank because of the following, First off many 16 years old are discouraged to get their licenses because they're normally the one less experinced. Many drivers on the road have been driving for 5+ years and many of them have no paitence for young adolesent drivers who are driving to catuciously or recklessly. Another reason is that since most of them do not have a license, they aren't able to cause any accident at all. This is why there is so few of them actually licensed. Finally, many 16 year olds drive their friends which leads into peer pressure to pull their prilveges to the extreme.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,A,N,N,M,437465,11,12331101,"<p>I disagree with Frank because the her claim is not true.

VALIDATION,A,N,N,M,437108,11,12331099,"<p>I agree with Frank, because 16 year olds are the youngest, and have the fastest reaction time. Also, they're only 16, so they cant get drunk or some stupid stuff that screws up the rest of their life. And since most 16 year olds are just starting to drive cars, we are more eager to learn about the rules of the road than 19 year olds who are mostly just impateint freaks, or daredevils. In my own experiences, I've noticed that 16 year olds are probably more immature than 19 year olds. Every teenager will eventually have his need for speed day and when it comes, its going to be more likely tackled on by a 19 year old than one who is younger. Also, for 16 year olds who are starting to drive, their insurace cost is already over the roof, and if they get into an accident, the price is going to be even bigger, so they have a mindset to try their best not to get into an accident.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,H,N,N,F,437259,11,12331100,"<p>I disagree with Frank. &nbsp;He only sees the number of accidents but doesn't see the number of the ones that are actually licensed. &nbsp;There is a less amount of 16 year-old drivers therefore there are less accidents. &nbsp;But the higher in age there are a few more accidents, but there is an increase of licensed people.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VALIDATION,H,N,N,F,10696479,11,12331547,"<p>I belive that Frank is wrong because being a 16 year old driver we are younger and also more immature than someone who is older. Also, in the graph shown 19 year olds are older and more of them hold a license and that is why there are more accidents than someone who is 16. Another point is not everyone who is 16 owns a license.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,A,N,N,M,1014302,11,12331124,"<p>I disagree with Frank. I desiagree because a lot of 16 year olds claim to be the best drivers. But are they really? No! Of course not. When a kid is 16 years old they think they know everything, but they dont. I know because I myself am 16. Drving is very useful but can also be very danferous. The reason why 16 year olds dont have a lot of accidents is because there are less 16 year olds than the 17-19 year olds. Parents arent just going to let their 16 year old drive knowing that they are irresponsible. They have to proove their parents otherwise with doing chore without being told, getting good grades, taking care of siblings, etc. Driving is a privelage.&nbsp;</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,1111639,11,12331114,"<p>I disagree with Frank. Although 16-year-olds have the fewest accidents, it is because they are also the fewest to have driver's licenses. You need to look at the percentage of accidents for each age. About 37% of sixteen-year-olds had an accident in the United States in 2010, while 32% of 17-year-olds had an accident that year. 29% of 18-year-olds had an accident that year, and 25% of 19-year-olds had an accident. This proves that 16-year-olds, in fact, are the least safe drivers. Sorry Frank!</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,A,N,N,M,1111534,11,12331115,"<p>i disagree with Frank. The only reason why the number of accidents in 16 year olds are lower than that of the other ages is that there is a significant difference in number from 16 year olds and the latter. If we were to see these as percentage of accidents with number of licensed drivers, the percentage is seen as follows:</p> <p>Age - Percent of accidents</p> <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38%</p> <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32%</p> <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29%</p> <p>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25%</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As you can see, 16 year old drivers have a far greater chance of being in an accident.

VALIDATION,A,N,N,F,1111573,11,12331116,"<p>When looking at Table 1, it does show that 16 year olds do have the least number of accidents but that does not justify that they are the safest driveres just because of the those numbers. 16 year olds would have the least number of accidents because they are the ones who are most careful and when driving, they need an adult/supervisor by their side to check up on them and see if they are driving correctly or not making it an advantage of driving safely. The reason why the numbers increase as the age increases would be that they're not with an guide/adult making it more likely for an accident to happen since they're not careful enough. Addionally 16 year olds are more cautious of the way how they drive, since they're anamateur. When being an beginner in things, you're bound to be more aware about the thing that you're doing and concentrated and focused. The more you get used to it the less careful and attentive you'll be.

By creating a ratio of number of accidents to number of drivers in each age group, and then gleaning the percentges from that ratio, I found that the members of the 16-year-old driver category were at least 5% more likely to get into an accident than the closest other age group, the 17-year-olds.

VALIDATION,W,N,N,M,7603826,11,12331440,"<p>I would agree with Frank for the most part, due to the evidence from the data table. The chart doesn't really go into too much detail about why 16 year-olds are the safest drivers, it just so happens that they get in the least amount of accidents. Most likely if someone has their lisense at age 16, they haven't been driving very long. There'a a good chance that a 18 or 19 year old would have more experience. However, I'v noticed 17-19 year-olds typically get out more, and if they have had their liscense for a while, they could easily become over-confident, which can be a major threat to safety. Now as far as 16-year-old drivers go, they're still living with their parents, or have more authority over them since they're under 18.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also makes sense because they have just started driving, so they're likely to be more cautious. If they do happen to get in a wreck, their parents will be all over it, so that kind of puts fear into them. These are things I've learned from personal experience, along with basic facts, and of coarse, the data chart. If I had to argue one thing it would be that, 16 year olds, for the most part are the least experienced in driving, so they will most likely get into a few accidents because of it, or their nerves get to them. Over all I can understand why it's the 19-year olds that end up in the most accidents.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In my opinion not all teenagers are safe drivers, some just drive safe when an adult is with them and when they are alone, they might even break some laws.

VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,5841528,11,12331414,"<p>Frank is correct. The 16 year old drivers seems to be the safest. They have the least amount of accidents, but they also have the least amount of actual drivers so the amount of accidents means nothing because all of the other ages have a bigger amount of drivers and accidents. What does matter though is that for one 16 year old driver there is about 2.72 accidents. For one 17 year old driver there is about 3.13 accidents, for an 18 year old driver there is about 3.43 accidents, and for 19 year old drivers there is about 3.96 accidents.

VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,5841570,11,12331420,"<p>I disagree with Franklin D. Roosevelt very much so. In part because of his policies on refugee children in Isreal during WWII, but also because he is wrong about 16 year olds being the safest drivers. The reason he is wrong is not only because the refugee chidren were starving but also because the ratio for drivers to accidents in 16 year olds is a little under half that drive get into accidents. This I took the total number of drivers in each category and divided that number by the number of people who got into accidents. Sixteen year olds had the greatest ratio of crashes to drivers, for this reason, and also because REFUGEE children from Isreal should have been rescued after the mass genocide of the Jews by Hitler, Frank was wrong.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,5841572,11,12331421,"<p>I disagree with Frank: 16-year-olds are not the safest teenage drivers, 19-year-olds are the safest teenage drivers. Because the numer of licensed drivers is not equal for all four age groups, the number of accidents cannot be directly compared to each other; the percentage of licensed drivers who get into accidents for each age group needs to be found. Although Frank is correct that 16-year-olds have the fewest number of accidents, the percentage of 16-year-olds who get in an accident is the highest of the four ages. If we divide the number of accidents for 16-year-olds and divide by the number of licensed drivers for 16-year-olds, we can see that around 37% of 16-year-olds get into an accident: 580000/1578000 = 0.37*100 = 37%. Repeating this process for the three other age groups, we find that 32% of 17-year-olds get into accidents, 29% of 18-year-olds get into accidents, and only 25% of 19-year-olds get into accidents. Therefore, Frank's claim is incorrect: 16-year-olds are actually the most likely age group of licensed teenage drivers to get into an accident, whereas 19-year-olds are actually the safest teenage drivers whom are least likely to get into an accident.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VALIDATION,W,N,N,M,5841816,11,12331411,"<p>I would disagree with frank because the 16 year old drivers may have the lowest amount of accidents, but they also have the lowest amount of licensed drivers.&nbsp; so the only way to solve it would be to subtract the number of accidents from the number of licensed drivers in that age group to find the highest and lowest numbers for each age group.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As you grow older, you tend to forget about the small rules. For example, coming out of drivers ed, you know that you should turn into the closest lane to you but a few years down the road, you may think of that rule as a lesser important one and stop following it. Another example that applies to this is a teenager in drivers ed gets used to coming to a complete stop at every stop sign because they are being monitored but once a teen is licensed and on their own, they get used to rolling stops because no one is watching them.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perhaps the number of accidents of 16 year old drivers is decreased compared to those older because there are less 16 year olds with licenses. If you were to increase the number of teenage drivers on the road at the age of 16, the amount might increase. This would make the 19 year old age group the safest drivers because they'd have the fewest number of accidents but in this case, 16 year olds are the safest drivers.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once you find the percentage of the results to even out the different number of drivers and accidents, though, you will find that 16 years only have 27% in accidents (the smallest percentage) while 19 year olds have 39% of number accidents (the biggest percentage).

While the older people get, the more they forget about some rules and regulations. But there are also more older people driving and they have more expericne than the new bees.
