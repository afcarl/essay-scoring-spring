And the Turkey needs to be 10 so they can all be equal in the amount of 10's into 20's. The Cheese can be a little bit higher to get the same thing and toping in each topic.The ham can also be cut into tewenty pieces.By the ay the turkey shoyld be ten....... if it all was counting by tens then it will be equal. So if you put them seperated it would make sense.But since it says how much are needed it will fix the problem to give to each one of those children. For the ham sandwiches the amount of sandwiches could be chosen if that kind of kid wants to. And the turkey sandwiches are put togerther nobody will know the difference. And that's how it should be seperated into equal groups and signs. The cheese is not okay because if its 24 sandwiches it should be 30 or 20 sandwwiches.</p>,539,554,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,

TRAINING,W,N,N,M,11718889,3,10234171,"<p>24 sandwiches can fit in a box. I got this number by using the length, and width of the box. Also I used the sandwich. First I took a look at the sandwich. It was three inches wide and three inches tall. Then I took a look at the width of the box. The width was 18 inches. Now what I did was the tricky part. I took the width of the sandwich (wich was three inches) and added it until I got to the width of the box (wich was 18 inches). Finally I used the number of how many times it took me to get to 18 and used that number (wich was 6) to let me know how many sandwitches would fit in the width of the box. Now that I had the number 6 as my width number I had to figure out how many sandwitches would fit in the length of the box. The first thing I had to do was take a quick look at the length of the box. The length of the box was 18 inches. Next I looked at the length of the sandwich. The length of the sandwich was 12 inches.Now I did the same thing as before but only going up to 12. The number I got was 4. Now here is the hardest part. I know six sandwiches will fit in one row and I know there can be 4 rows of sandwiches. So if six sanwiches can fit in each row and we can have four rows of sandwiches we have enough room for 4 rows of six! So to find out how many sandwiches I have I can use the multiplication sentence 4 x 6! 4 x 6 = 24! I can fit 24 sandwiches in the box.

So back to the sandwiches I found out that on the left side you could fit 5 sandwiches and so on the other side ( the right side) you could fit 5 sandwiches. So then (last but not least) I figured out that on the bottom you can fit 6 sandwiches so on the top you can fit 6 sandwiches too.
