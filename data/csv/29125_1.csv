VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,7682739,4,12332363,"<p>No because there are 8 teams and 86 people. 8*10 is 80 so that means that there will be at least 10 people on each team, because there are 86 people. Then you have 6 people left to sort on to a team. You have 6 people left know put the two people from the 6 people left on 3 teams then every one is on there team.
