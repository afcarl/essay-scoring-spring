So, the trick to solving that is to do 84+85=169 (because those were the two numbers the median had to be between) then I did 169 divided by 2=84.5. That was the median percentage. So then I did the math to see how many students that would be. So, I did 84.5x4=338.0. If you round that it would be 338 students.

This number is based on the number of students who showed up, on the 2008 - 2009 chart above. To get this number I took the average of the chart (also known as mean) which was 85%. Then I took the median and got 84.5%. Well since these numbers are close together I rounded to a hole number 85%, the reason I did not round to 84% is, there is a .5, (anything that is or above .5 you round up, anything below .5 you round down.) Also the average was 85%. To get the number of students you have to cross multiply. To do that you have to turn the numbers into fractions, 85% = 85/100 because 85% just means 85 out of 100. Then you take your 400 and turn that into a fraction X/400, X is the number 85% represents. Now you go 100 * X to get 100X, then go 85 * 400 to get 34000. Now you get why we call it cross multiply :-). Then you put them side by side like this 100X=34000, you want to get X by its self so you have to take the 100 away, to do that you divide by 100 which leaves you with 1X. You don't really need the one so if you want you can get rid of it to be left with X. Well what you do to one side you do the other so you divide 34000 by 100 to get 340. Now if you had been flowing me on paper and you lined it up right you would have got X=340. Since X was you answer and it equals 340, 340 is your answer.

VALIDATION,2,N,N,M,11509486,6,12326978,"<p>I expect that 305 of the students will attend the 2014 talent show. I predict this for two reasons. If you look at last years attendance record it dropped from 88% the year before all the way too 81% last year. That shows that a drop in attendance is probable. The other reason is if 400 students go to this school then you have to divide 400 by 5 to get 80. That shows that you would have to break the percentages into fifths. For example, if 320 people came then 64% of the students would come ,or if 350&nbsp; students came then 70% percent of the students would attend. So, When you divide 400 which is the number of students coming by 5 you end up with 80. Then break 400 in to fourth. 75% is equal to 300 so 80 - 75 = 5. I then added 5 to 300 to end up with 305 students attending.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So I divided 50% into 2 pieces, which were 25%. I also divided 200 into 2 pieces, which gave me 100. I added 50% + 25%, which gave me 75%. I still needed 10%, so I divided the 25% into 5 pieces, which meant I had to divide a 100 into 5 pieces, which gave me 20. I multiplied 20 by 2, and 5% by 2, Which gave me 40 and 10%.
