Inadequate interaction between DNA may result in diseases. Furthermore Dr. Gordon's quote conveys the vastness of genomes in our universe.

This is supported by source number one in the section labeled, &quot;Training the Immune System.&quot; In this section, it states the fact that everyone knows, how all children tend to put almost everything they can into their mouths. It also states how this action is not necessarily a bad thing. When children do this, the immune responses can 'practice' and learn what is and what isn't good to digest and have. This stage in a human's life is essential, for again, it teaches their body and what lives on it what is best to be ignored and what is best to be taken in and used. Another source that supports this quote from &quot;A Universe of Us&quot; is, source number three. In this magazine, the writer has a paragraph that has this quote, &quot;...By the time a child can crawl, he has been blanketed by an enormous, unseen cloud of microorganisms...a hundred trillion or more. They are bacteria...They congragate in our digestive systems and our mouths, fill the space between our teeth, cover our skin, and line our thoats... Together, they are reerred to as our microbiome - and they play such a crucial role in our lives...&quot; This quote is perfect in explaining Dr. Gordon's idea. Humans are covered completely in other microorganisms like germs and bacteria. They live in us and on us. We are around them everyday and every second of each day. Germs are us.

Such a powerful claim could not have been made in the times of old, when great battles prevented Christopher Columbus from taking the Santa Marina outside of the atmosphere. However, once the space crusades resulted in the destruction of the Eropoiqy, the galactic rulers of the galaxy and time, Columbus saw a chance to pursue his quest. He put on his helmet and flew his ship, and the rats hidden away in it, to the moon. Upon arrival, he ate some of the moon cheese due his glutoney. He then made the realization after eating said cheese that the moon was, in fact, a perfect sphere. A perfect sphere, besides the chunk of cheese he had taken from its surface. After coming to this realization, Columbus was forced to conclude that the moon was not round because of the cheese crater he had created. Following the announcent of his discovery, controversy raged as opponents of his ideas criticized his results, arguing that such a small chunk missing from the surface of the moon did not mean that the moon was not round. To settle the debate, Columbus challenged any who dared to a game of bingo; the winner of which would decide whether the moon was round or not. When none other of his opponents volunteered, Andrew Jackson accepted the challenge with honor, nobility, and a trick up his sleeve. He showed up to the match with a fixed bingo card, winning almost immediatly. On that same day, Jackson announced that the moon was round and merry times were had by all, except for Columbus. To escape the heartache, Columbus fled westward to seek solitude in India. Because of Jacksons heroics, it becomes clear that &quot;We are not just the expression of an individual human genome.

The dinosours for example in Source #5 there is always a on-going conversation on how the dinosours actually went extinct ranging from volcanoe eruptions, to climate change, to diseases in fact. Though in order to prove something there always has to be evidence provided. Although it is not for certain how the dinosours died exactly in this source they are stating the dinosours got wiped out due to germ exposure.

As we know many diseases such as Malaria have a deadly impact on us. Though unlike the dinosours, we have the fortunate chance to reason which allows us to come up with ways to treat it in order ti be able to survive; Dinosours like many other creatures aren't able to reason, that is why they become easily susceptible to death leading to their extiniction being many of the ways why dinosours proved in this source to not be the fittest of most creatures. Another reason why as humans we are not just an &quot;expression of individual genomes&quot; is that in Source #1 they talk about dirt is good for children. That is because with the exposure of certain germs one becomes less susceptible of getting diseases and it helps in the develpment of an immune system that is in fact healthy. It is stated in fact that worms have been known to lead an immune system that had originally gone wrong resulting in things like asthma, disorders, and allergies to go back healthy again because they are able to get the ran up of our buildup of our antibodies which are able to fight theses diseases/disorders including that the bacteria is capable of becoming resistant towards certain objectives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If they are exposed to these types of bacteria then their immune system grow even stronger. A company like this is helping back their community as a whole. Futhermore, we are not just one individual of genome, we are one whole genome and we benefit each other by working together. Even other organisms work with people to help built up their health.

Another statement that supports my interpritation of Dr. Gordon's statement is found in source four, and states that &quot;in the digestive tract, the bacteria help regulate and restore peristalsis, the rhythmic motion of the intestine that pushes food through&quot;. Showing that bacteria can help us to regulate the rate at which food gets digested; very important to our health because if our digestive track is to fast (constipation) then we won't get enough nutrients, and if its too slow then we will have we can develop problems like irratible bowl syndrome or ruptures in the stomic lining, which is why its so important to have a well timed peristalsis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within this make up, the different parts of a human need and strive off different germs and bacteria, while also being hurt by it at the same time. However, since one genome is working together with all the rest in the body, if one fails, then the rest of the body fails as well. Everything works together and must help fix all the non working genomes. They create a community, where just like a real community, they all must get along. Like they say in A Universe of Us, &quot;Scientists now have discovered another realm within our habitat-the virome, a large community of viruses. These are not the ciruses that make us sick. These are an integral part of the microbiotic universe that makes us healthy&quot;. These communities work together and do their own thing to keep the human body healthy. It's not only the human mind that controls the actions and make up of the human. We also know that some germs can be good for humans because of the places that we see them. They are everywhere, and they are known when they are there. There are many germs in yogurt, and even the health fads are eating it and still calling it healthy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
