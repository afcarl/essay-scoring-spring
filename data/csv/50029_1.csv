VALIDATION,H,Y,N,M,10115786,6,12322016,I think this means that since Sevillano has been working there so long he is allready like a expert at it. So he is like saying this job is for little kids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VALIDATION,W,N,N,F,10118619,6,12322017,"I think Sevillano is very encouraging and tries to make people feel good.

The money they earn needs to be used for their children if they want them to be healthy and well raised and filled and satisfied with education. For example in the text the child was looking for shells and oysters but the last one he found which he thought was bad and about to be throw the shell away but he saw that there was a pearl which would raise money and for him to sell that and earn enough money to take care of his life and parents and more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You pull the shells up and then the sink stone and you stack the shells and then you wait a while and do it all over again.It is work for children,'(O'Dell 1).&quot; That proves the Sevillano thinks that the child shouldn't be there because it is too much work for a child.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
